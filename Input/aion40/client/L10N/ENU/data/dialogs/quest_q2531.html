          <p>We must be going about this all wrong. There simply must be a way of getting to the bottom of this problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Identifying and eliminating the cause is important, but even then...there's a bit of catching up to do around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, of course, prevention is our number one concern.</p>

          <p>Analyzing the actual substance that changes people is going to be the first step to finding a preventative medicine. The trouble with gathering it is that it...changes...people...into undead....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a poisonous substance that comes from Beritra's Weapon--clearly we can't just put it into an ordinary container.</p>

          <p>I asked the Alchemy Master in Pandaemonium. He can make a Durable Potion Bottle, but he ran out of the materials and was too busy purifying the undead to get what he needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have time, would you consider finding the materials? It could prove to be so helpful.</p>

          <p>Thank you. You'll need to collect all of the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2531all] and then take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honir]. First, go to the Sky Temple of Arkanis in Morheim, remove some Ember Spirits, and collect some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2531a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When that's done, go to the Mosbear Snowfield, and collect some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2531b]s from a Silver Granker. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grad], an Alchemy Merchant in Pandaemonium, can sell you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shopmaterial_al_01a] to bind the Fire Crystals to the Granker Horns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take them to Honir when you're done and he'll make the bottle.</p>
