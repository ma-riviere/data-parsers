          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DireBeast_18_An]s are giving me a such headache!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> They usually stay in the Black Claw Village but now they keep attacking the wagons that supply the reconstruction site!</p>
       
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to go up there and just wipe them out. I can't, though, because I have to stay and supervise this place.</p>

          <p>It's said that they won't attack an opponent that is stronger than they are--Wait! I have an idea that will make them shake with fear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], please hunt them and bring me something that I can use to show them that we are stronger than they are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2259a] should show those taygas who is the boss. I'll hang it on the wagon to strike fear in their hearts.</p>
