          <p>Heard the rumors? Guardians around Reshanta have been ambushed by Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seeing how it's even happened to some secret scouting parties, Brigade General Sakmis thinks there must be a spy, so I have a special mission.</p>

          <p>It's just between the Brigade General and me, but...okay, I trust you, [%username]. Come a little closer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been watching the Asmodian teleporters. The spy must be using them, so I was looking for anyone...unusual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally I found him! What's his name...? Mokur, Mokufi? Mokkurkalfi! He's got to be the one.</p>

          <p>Well, he's been teleporting all over the Ridge of Latesran lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He doesn't wear any insignia of rank, but his weapons and armor are definitely special. He resembles the description given by survivors, and the Asmodian teleporters are scared to death of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My guess is he's watching our movements and laying his traps. The problem is, I don't know anyone who'll face off against someone like that. What about you, [%username]?</p>

          <p>When it's done, report to Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sakmis]. I'll tell him I assigned this to you.</p>
