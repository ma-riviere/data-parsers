          <p>There's something strange about this jungle, and it's critical that we figure out what's happening. The animals are growing larger and more aggressive all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Earth Spirits for example. I study them, you know. They've never been friendly, but if you left them alone they'd leave you alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now they attack anyone who comes near them. Senea asked me to investigate.</p>

          <p>I'm not quite sure. Like I said, I used to be able to go out and observe them. The Earth Spirits would go about their business and ignore me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But these [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_37_An]s are a different matter. Ideally what I'd do is try to take a few of them down and gather some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1544a] from each one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just have to figure out how to do that.</p>

          <p>That's very gracious of you, [%username]. I suppose it makes perfect sense to let a battle-tested [%userclass] take care of this kind of work, rather than a scientist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usually we don't have a handy [%userclass] volunteering to help, though!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're really interested in helping, gather some samples of the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1544a] that forms the Earth Spirits.</p>
