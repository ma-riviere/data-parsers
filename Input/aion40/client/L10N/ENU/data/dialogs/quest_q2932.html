          <p>Right, then. Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vidar] needs to grant your title.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll write you out a commendation letter for that formality. Then you visit Vidar, receive your title and attend the appointment ceremony. Don't worry. It's short.</p>

          <p>I am no word-smith, [%username]. I have no flowery speech prepared. Know only this--it is your armor that turns the claws of our foes. High walls and towers defend us here, but in the Abyss, armor is the only defense! Few will meet the Daeva who saves their life, but I thank you.</p>
