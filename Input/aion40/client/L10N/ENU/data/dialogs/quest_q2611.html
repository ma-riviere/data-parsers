          <p>Red Mane Cavern was once a Mau Village, but its position and topographical advantages make it an excellent center for Asmodian and Mau counter-Balaur activity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you doubt the strategic value of this place, you've only to look around at who's been assigned here.</p>

          <p>Well, let's see--there's the Drakan Punisher Legion, to begin with. We also have a Shadow Executor, the Archons of Dusk...and then there's me. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was a Centurion at Beluslan Fortress, specializing in Counter-Balaur warfare, before I got orders for Red Mane Cavern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how long you plan to be here, but there are a few people you ought to meet if you want to play a part in this operation.</p>
