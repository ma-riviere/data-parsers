          <p>This may be an odd question, but has your fatigue ever dissipated after seeing a pair of bright, clear eyes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to find more evidence for this peculiar theory...validate it through experimentation.</p>

        	<p>Sometimes, I'll watch Senea perform her research on Sylphens late into the night, and their big, glorious eyes do something to me. My melancholy goes away, my coughing ceases, and I feel light as Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe the eyes of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MutaRE_36_An] emit some kind of special...clarity. Would you help me look into this?</p>
