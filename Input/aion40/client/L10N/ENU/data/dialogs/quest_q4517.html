          <p>Ah, [%username], just in time for my latest inspiration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, not every Lepharist is a soldier. There's a cadre of laborers who build and maintain buildings, make supply runs, mine ores, and other such tasks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're mostly made up of new recruits and those still untrained with sword or spell. In fact, they're the ones who built Alquimia in the first place.</p>

          <p>I've kept a close eye on the Laborers during my trips there. Everyone else is so used to seeing them that they're practically ignored, like they're part of the scenery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But grunt labor like that is what keeps them going. If we disrupt that work flow, we can disrupt all of their operations in one fell swoop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If a Daeva--say yourself--were to take out a large group of laborers, the damage could be devastating. What do you think? Up to it?</p>

          <p>Good job. But don't think for a minute this will discourage most of them. They're fanatics at heart, and fanatics have a way of ignoring reality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, life at Alquimia just got a lot more difficult, and that's a big victory for Pandaemonium, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll report this in. In the meantime, take this for your trouble. It should come in handy.</p>
