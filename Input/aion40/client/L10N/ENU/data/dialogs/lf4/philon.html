          <p>If it weren't for Sulla, I doubt I'd have any research grants at all! The Daevas back in Sanctum just don't understand how troubling the ecology is in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, to them it's all about Tiamat and the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sulla's helping me find proof of the land's continuing deterioration so that I can send a report back to Sanctum, make everyone there realize that this issue is just as important as Balaur strategic movement.</p>
