          <p>My first impression of Balaurea is that the people here are rather mean to outsiders. There's no room for that in this land--Daevas must be united in order to survive!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And this Bind Point is particularly vulnerable. More fearsome than the attacks by the Balaur are the neverending assaults by the dark winged ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back at Sanctum, I was a soldier in the Abyss. But compared to here in Balaurea, the Abyss was child's play!</p>
