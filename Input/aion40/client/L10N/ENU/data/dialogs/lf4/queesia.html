          <p>I have a favor to ask...to beg of you, actually. Will you check in on us here periodically to make sure we still stand our ground?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have asked Sanctum to send us reinforcements, but they claim we have too many soldiers here in Balauria as it is. I don't know how we're going to fend off any further attacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The last reinforcement Sanctum sent us was a Steward named Chekius. The silly fool showed up smelling like ale and holding a rusty weapon.</p>
