          <p>What do you think? About the Air Line, I mean. It uses the power of Aion fragments in the sky to lift you up as cleanly as though you were in Elysea.</p>

          <p>Smoothest flight you ever had, don't you think? No? Hmph, you are a stubborn one.</p>

          <p>Come to think of it, you don't take our Research Center seriously. Why is that exactly? It was our Research Center that discovered the Windstreams!</p>

          <p>In Balaurea there are many places with strong air currents. These currents are Windstreams. They let you go from one place to another, and fast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you know the currents, you can reach far away or elevated places, or simply descend when you reach your destination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you're an inexperienced flyer, you might crash. So, be careful!</p>
