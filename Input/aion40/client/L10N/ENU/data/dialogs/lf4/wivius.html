          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how many times I have to say it, but I used to be a Legionary myself. I quit because of those tea-sipping, knuckle-dragging loons in charge! Always bickering about who's a better leader, who's better looking, whose wings have more girth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No Centurion or Tribunus commands me now! It's just me and my Dramatas. And one day I'll find one and strike it down, and it will echo across the cowardly spines of those arrogant Legionaries like a symphony!</p>
