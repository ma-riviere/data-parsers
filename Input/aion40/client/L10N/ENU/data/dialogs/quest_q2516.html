          <p>It's hard to feel safe in Beluslan these days, between a collapsing fortress, people getting struck by falling fragments....And there's no end of dangerous creatures around here, either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, we're also shorthanded. The Archons we do have are too busy to tend to culling the local beasties.</p>

          <p>It is. Luckily we've been allotted some Silver Coins to reward other Daevas who can take on jobs the Archons can't be spared for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Right now we need someone to hunt the Vespines and Black Branch Gnarls. Is that something you're interested in, [%username]?</p>

          <p>There are a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VespaD_29_n]s right outside the fortress. They're a bloody nuisance to the residents.</p>

          <p>So go out and kill those pests for us, and I'll be waving your silver coin when you come back.</p>

          <p>You got rid of the Plains Vespines and Black Branch Gnarls, and received a silver coin as a reward.</p>
