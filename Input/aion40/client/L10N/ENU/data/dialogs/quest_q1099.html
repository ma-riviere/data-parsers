          <p>Now that we have the weapon and the spell of protection, what we have to do is to go find the Artifact of Memory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said many times in the past, the way to Karamatis isn't going to be easy, but you must fully recover your memory in order to know who you really are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With that, you'll know which path you must take.</p>

          <p>First, go to the Divine Fortress located in the deepest layer of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you leave now, you will be able to find the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_AB1_FinalPortal_Q1099] connecting to Karamatis under the floating island. The fissure will close before too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to find the Artifact of Memory on your own, but take these--the Sword of Transcendence and the Pearl of Protection. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hermione] will teach you how to use them. Good luck.</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]. I've been waiting for you since receiving the message from Pernos. Give me the Pearl of Protection and I will infuse its power into you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll help you bind the Sword of Transcendence to your soul, as well. It will lose its appearance, but its power will be bound to you and help you defeat Orissan.</p>

          <p>That's unfortunate. I suspect the Shadow folks have gotten a hold of you. Sounds as though you've taken them seriously.</p>
