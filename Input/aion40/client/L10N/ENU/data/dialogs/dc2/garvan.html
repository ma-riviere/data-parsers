          <p>The virtue of Gladiators and Templars is courage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Courage comes from trust in oneself. That's why I always compliment and encourage my charges. A hand shaking in fear cannot hold a sword in a steady grip.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you need new skills, please don't hesitate to ask. Part of courage is knowing when courage alone is not enough.</p>
