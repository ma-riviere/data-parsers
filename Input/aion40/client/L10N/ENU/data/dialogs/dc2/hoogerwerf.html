          <p>Don't be too proud of yourself, Daeva. Just because destiny has been written doesn't mean you can't be kicked to a bloody pulp along the way. Assassins and Rangers know that better than anyone. That's why they embrace the shadows even more than most Asmodians.</p>

          <p>I can sell you skill manuals, but it's up to you to give yourself to the darkness. It alone will never abandon you.</p>
