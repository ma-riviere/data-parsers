          <p>Sometimes Asmodians like Leokev put too much value and trust in offensive capability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such a shame, and so short-sighted. We value life just as much as the Elyos. After all, only those who survive the enemies' blows are able to land blows of their own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course if you've been to the Abyss, you likely understand that already. Perhaps your talking to me is proof--show me that you do understand.</p>
