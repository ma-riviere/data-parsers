          <p>I almost pity Daevas who cannot use shields. It is such a valuable part of the defensive arsenal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then again, I suppose I'm biased; I'm a front-line kind of Daeva, so of course a shield is a necessity for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're the front-line type like me, I suggest you take a look at what I have to offer.</p>
