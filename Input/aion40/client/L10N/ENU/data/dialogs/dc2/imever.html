          <p>As you know, Stigma Stones are all that remains of those Daeva who have died forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This fact has always struck me as very sad, and that's why I treat my Stones with the utmost respect. There may be a family mourning the man or woman whom this Stone once was, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you treat these Stigma Stones with respect too. Make sure their sacrifice in Asmodae's name was not in vain.</p>
