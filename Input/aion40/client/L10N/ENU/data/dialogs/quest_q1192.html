          <p>No time for greetings. The Krall have been upping the intensity of their attacks, and the moment has come for us to act.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Problem is, they've switched their tactics, so we can't predict their movements as we used to. If I assign a unit to the front, we're struck from behind, and so on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've lost so many Guardians.... Our numbers are low, Daeva--we need reinforcements and we need them now.</p>

          <p>Ah, you'll need to speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Xenophon] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA38]. He has bested the Krall in combat many times. His experience should help sort this out.</p>    
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can't send more people without more information. Tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Spatalos] that we can talk about reinforcements after he knows what's going on.</p>

          <p>Verteron Citadel faces the full fury of the Krall, does it? Hmm...well, if you want my opinion, which is worth quite a bit if I may say so....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a trick. They're hiding their real plot by distracting the Guardians from the Krall camp and keeping them busy at the citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This isn't typical of the Krall--it's Kraka's leadership that's managed to get this tribe so far.</p>

          <p>It's obvious that further investigation is needed. We must be vigilant, but more so we must take positive action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These raids are just denting our armor. They won't amount to much, no matter how it seems to the soldiers who have to fend them off. It's what lies in their camp that needs watching.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone will have to infiltrate the Tursin Garrison. This is the only sure way to uncover the Krall plot. Let Spatalos know right away.</p>

          <p>And the Krall, just teasing us? Tell that to the wounded Guardians! What's all this about a plot? We have no way to defend ourselves, let alone infiltrate the Tursin Garrison! And all for some "plot" for which no one has found any evidence!</p>

          <p>With the Krall intensifying their attacks on Verteron Citadel, many soldiers have been wounded and the citadel is running out of defense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Spatalos has ordered you to deliver a letter to Lavirintos, the Guardian Commander in Sanctum, requesting reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After reading the letter, Lavirintos refused to send the reinforcements, saying that it wouldn't be any use if the Krall's intentions remain unexplored.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Xenophon, an expert who Lavirintos recommended, told you that the Krall attack is nothing but a smokescreen and someone must infiltrate their stronghold to find out what they are really plotting.</p>
