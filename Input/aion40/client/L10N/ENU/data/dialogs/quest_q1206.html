      	<p>I've just heard reports from the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA14]--the news is grave. The Asmodians have secured a number of strongholds there.</p>
        <p> </p> 
       	<p>You look uninterested, but I must remind you that our entire way of life--our very existence--is at risk here</p>
        <p> </p>         
        <p>Our [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09]s are struggling against the Asmodians as we speak, and as priest of Akarios Village, it is my duty to send them tribute to help support our cause.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>You see, while the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA14] is a desolate and harsh wasteland, Aion and our Seraphim Lords have granted us this world of Elysea, full of fertile pastures and natural life. It would be foolish of us to not take advantage of this environment.</p>

          <p>Very good. I have considered sending rations to the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA14], as we normally do. However, in this time of crisis, something else may be needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have received word from [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07] that they need more healing potions for our suffering [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09]s. Unfortunately, they're running low on the key ingredient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I need you to bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a], so we can send it on to our alchemists in Sanctum. The herb grows in abundance throughout [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF1_name].</p>

          <p>We'll need to send over three samples for now. You can find the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a] growing among the trees.</p>
