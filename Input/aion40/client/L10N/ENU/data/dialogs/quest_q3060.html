          <p> </p>
          <p>You thought it belonged to a bounty hunter. You brought it to Rosina and Tityus and asked them if they knew anything about it. Tityus said that he saw Nagrunerk's bodyguard holding it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you showed it to the bodyguard, he said it belonged to his master. When Nagrunerk saw the diary, he was surprised, said that it belonged to him, and gave you money to keep it quiet.</p>
