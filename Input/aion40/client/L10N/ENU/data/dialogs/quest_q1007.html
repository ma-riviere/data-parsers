          <p>These are dark times, [%username]. The Asmodian scourge draws closer every passing day. Our way of life is under constant threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems you remember defending Elysea, even if not consciously. I believe you are ready to help us again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have begun your ascension, but you must go to Sanctum to receive your blessing and complete the process. Only then can you call yourself one of the ascended few.</p>

          <p>Do not be surprised by her appearance; she ascended when she was very young and is more powerful than she appears. I have a feeling you two will help each other a great deal over the coming months.</p>
