          <p> A [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA65] stole the Icons of Lord Kaisinel--the ones we had blessed for those carrying out the Great Pilgrimage.</p>

          <p>Those creatures don't worship the Seraphim Lords, or even Aion! Why would they take our holy Icons?</p>

          <p>Wait...they've been refining Odium, haven't they? Do you think they might want to extract the Aether from them?</p>
