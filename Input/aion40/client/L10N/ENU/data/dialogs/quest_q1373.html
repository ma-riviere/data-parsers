          <p>There is a great sickness in the village. One villager is covered with oozing open sores. It's a wonder he has any healthy skin left!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've tried everything, but nothing brings him relief. Hot Spring Water might cure the disease...but it's too dangerous for Humans to get the water.</p>

          <p>Hot spring water itself is not difficult to draw. The problem is that this spring water is only effective when it is hot--very hot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No Human is fast enough to carry it back before the water gets cold. But a Daeva could collect the water and then use the Obelisk to return while the water is still hot.</p>
