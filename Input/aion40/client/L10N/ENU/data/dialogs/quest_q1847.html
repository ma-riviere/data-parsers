          <p>It shouldn't really come as a surprise, I suppose, but the creatures here are so different from those ones in Elysea and Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look here, for instance. This beetle is almost identical to a species we have in Poeta. Only these little fellows have adapted to the heat, and their shells change color to blend in with the scenery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, if creatures truly are products of their environment, what does that say about us? Could it be that we are not blessed, and the cursed Asmodians are only hideous because of Asmodae's environment?</p>

          <p>Many years ago our ancestors used a special kind of magic to punish the most serious of crimes. This magic separated soul from body, and trapped the former within an inanimate object.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is no animal, Daeva. This is the soul of one of Elysea's most feared heretics. Please, you must take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dionera]. Fast as you can.</p>

          <p>Well, hand it here then. I'll put in the container with the rest of his strange trinkets. No doubt that strange bandana-wearing man will be along soon to pick them up.</p>
