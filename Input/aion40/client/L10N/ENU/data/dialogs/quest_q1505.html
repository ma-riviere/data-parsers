          <p>So many letters coming in lately. "Send us troops!" "We need troops!" "Reinforcements over this way!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to help them, but we don't have enough soldiers here as it is. I have none to spare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most have been understanding of my refusals, but [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ibelia] just won't listen.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks for that. If there's anything I have time for, it's writing letters every other day describing how shorthanded we are.</p>

          <p>That's fine, though. I suppose you have your own business to take care of.</p>
