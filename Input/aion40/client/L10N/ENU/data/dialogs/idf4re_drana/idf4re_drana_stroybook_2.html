          <p>Dearest Friend,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When a commander sendest thee to gate duty, demotest thee from the field, and then forgetest! Thou art doomed to play guard sergeant forever, watching woeful the least eventful door.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Days run one into the next. I treat my fellows as broodmates, yet they bear me no love. Nor I them neither.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'faith, we are none of us easiest to love, only to beat at dice. I simply cheat better.</p>

          <p>Then HE arrives. I know him not but by his looks. Practically my twin, he dresses in court garb. On his way to the Lords, no doubt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mirror his expressions as best I can. "More practice for most enterprise."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he sees not the use of a double, then he has not the mind I credit him. Truly, he can't let me pass.</p>

          <p>Dearest Friend,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mine twin of phiz names himself Surama and he visits at constant pace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mimic his manner as we walk through the Capitol--I dressing in his raiment and he in mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We perigrinate to a place called Drana Esoterrace, where enemies sometimes join their spilled blood and where my Surama becomes Warden of all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Love to the broodlings, and try to spare the one that bears my name!</p>

          <p>(Now that you think about it, you've met Murugan, though he doesn't bear much resemblance to Surama. Maybe it's a Balaur oddity? You open another letter.)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dearest Friend,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thinkest thou that watering plants is shameful? My troth, it is not. First, I toil for Surama, who knows my worth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, flares of combat give rise to crush weak Sapiens beneath our superiority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This day, a pocket of Reians appears, protesting treatment of a tree. Forsooth, a TREE. They flee before our might, and I wish to chase them down and smite them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surama forbids it. What does he plan for these piddling bugs? Why will he not share that plan with me?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Dearest Friend,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Surama hides more from me than we may speak of in letters!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today, I carry a sword. Tonight, I also carry a blade fragment. Surama denies his Lord and henceforth refuses Tiamat's authority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Long he bewails the gnawing of his soul, then he teases apart strings of Tiamat's control. With a mighty clang, his sword splits and Surama gives fragments of "Tiamat's Power" to myself and certain others. Shards go only to those unlikely to betray their whereabouts.</p>

          <p>With no weir-gift weapon in the Esoterrace, Tiamat neither sees nor hears the goings...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...nor flies his name in whispers and screams upon the unprompted Windstreams.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Surama plays a dangerous game, to tempt a Dragon Lord. I shall not let him fall.</p>
