          <p>Do you know why this region is called Theobomos?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aha! I can see by your face that you don't. It's the name of a Daeva who ruled this place long before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He so renowned for his wisdom that even the Empyrean Lords asked for his advice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But unfortunately, he died during the Cataclysm. It's said that he was killed in combat with the Dragon Lord Fregion himself.</p>

          <p>There is a reason for this history lesson. I have something to ask of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>A special order was issued by Sanctum to begin excavating the stronghold where Theobomos used to live, looking for anything that may be pre-Cataclysm.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, the stronghold has been abandoned for so long that the fortress has collapsed and there's nothing to find.</p>

          <p>Well...maybe not. I was fighting off some of the magical beings that kept disrupting our excavation, and they dropped Statue Pieces as they fled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems date back to Theobomos's time. Perhaps we should collect some more before we give up hope.</p>
