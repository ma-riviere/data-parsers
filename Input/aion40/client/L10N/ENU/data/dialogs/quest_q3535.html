          <p>Pacing? Well, yes, I guess I am pacing. This place makes me antsy. It's so quiet compared to the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Going from fighting in Reshanta to teaching Guardians in Heiron is kind of a sharp contrast. It'll take a while to adjust. The work is good though. I like teaching, it's just so much...slower.</p>

          <p>I suppose not. And things I think of as trivial, like maurauding Kerubiels...well, they're downright dangerous to the average villager. Something that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And honestly, a good Kerubiel hunt sounds pretty fun, but I've got a full class schedule today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't happen to be interested in clearing out the Kerubiels down by the Aetheric Field Observatory, would you?</p>

          <p>Good to hear. I'd love to wait and do it on my day off, but the villagers could really use the help sooner than that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could kill off the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Cherubim3_32_An]s near the Aetheric Field Observatory and bring back their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3535A]s, I can show the belts to the villagers to reassure them that the threat has been addressed.</p>

          <p>Let me see...ah, look at that tooling. These are definitely Kerubiel Belts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you. These should reassure the villagers. One less thing to worry about.</p>

          <p>He was busy with classes, so you eliminated the Kerubiel Sentinels for him and brought back Kerubiel Belts to prove the conquest.</p>
