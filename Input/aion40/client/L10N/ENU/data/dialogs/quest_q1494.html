          <p>Changanerk Traders is business, but family is important too, yes? Letters from Shugo Express help families stay in touch, but are stored in personal diaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Korumonerk is without his. Sad, sad Shugo.</p>

          <p>Before, Daeva helped Korumonerk. Now will help friendly Shugo again, yes? </p>

          <p>Daeva needs new jacket to go with pants. Korumonerk's family trained him to notice such things. Must complete set--fashion is very important for up and coming [%userclass].</p>
