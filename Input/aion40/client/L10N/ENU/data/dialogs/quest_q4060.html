          <p>This sounds like it belonged to Aureia. He sent his son away, but...I guess he didn't make it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His descendants might want to know what happened to him. That family's been using the character "Aur" in front of their names for generations.</p>

          <p>I'm not...but I once met someone who was. He remarked on the coincidence.</p>

          <p>His name was [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asustri]. Apparently his branch of the family started changing their names to "Asu" after some kind of tragedy.</p>

          <p>Yes...it certainly seems to be. My branch of the family changed their names to "Asu" in honor of those who stayed in Brusthonin and died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This diary's rather depressing. It all happened a long time ago, but you can still see the contamination in the land.</p>

          <p>You found an old diary while killing a Zombie. According to Ervin, it belonged to someone in the village. You decided to take it to their descendant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The family had the tradition of affixing "Aur" to the front of its name, so you asked all the Aurs you knew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually, one of them told you that he'd met someone from that family, but that they'd changed their name to "Asu." You showed the diary to Asustri and he said it belonged to his ancestor.</p>
