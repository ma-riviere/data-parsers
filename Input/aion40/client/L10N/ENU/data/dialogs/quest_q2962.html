          <p>Very well. A friend of mine has turned from the path and now threatens Asmodae itself. As brotherhood is our greatest calling, treachery is our greatest wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jafnhar] was once a Shadow Executor, but now has joined the Shadow Elders--conspirators who look to uncover some hidden "truth" about our origins. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to take him a message. The Shadow Court has ordered all judges and executors to locate him. If he is found, they will not treat him kindly. </p>
