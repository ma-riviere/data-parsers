          <p>The mystical capabilities of the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA16] are astounding. Most interesting is how it can record a person's soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shadow Court forbids it, but I am researching how this happens.</p>

          <p>Do not worry, it is not your soul I need, but your bravery. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2254a]s are necessary to prove my theory, and they're...difficult to acquire.</p>
