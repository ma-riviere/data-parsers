          <p>Hikarunerk knows already! Daeva has come to ask for passage to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Ship_Li], yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cost? Free to all foes of Steel Rake! Nasty, evil, hateful Shulacks! Makes a Shugo want to spit!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will drop you at the stern. Then will pull back and wait at a very, very safe distance. Even if Daeva survives the first few moments aboard, getting out is another matter.</p>

          <p>No, no, no! Daeva is not ready. Not yet. Messy death, much blood.</p>

          <p>Captain says only Daevas who have gone before can be sent to the Steel Rake. Look, look! Does not say [%username] on list!</p>

          <p>Sorry, Daeva. Hikarunerk really wants to help, but paws are bound!</p>

          <p>Daeva has invisible allies?</p>

          <p>Surely is not alone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Steel Rake pirates are really, really dreadful. Hikarunerk cannot allow Daeva to face danger on upper and lower decks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva insists on going alone, go to Amirinrinerk and ask to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ShulackShip_L_2F], so Daeva has chance of surviving.</p>
