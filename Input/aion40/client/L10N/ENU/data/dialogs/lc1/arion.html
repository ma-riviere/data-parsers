          <p>Many Daevas want to know what the future holds for them, but I sense that you have questions about...the past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sadly, my gift is to look forward. Of course you don't need a prophet to see dark times ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The war between the Elyos and the Asmodians is accelerating. Many of us with the gift of sight are deeply concerned.</p>

          <p>The end is coming, and it may not be a victory for either side. I have seen a mighty Daeva, infused with Aether so bright that his--or her--face is hidden from me. This Daeva holds the key to the salvation of Atreia!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is this Daeva Asmodian or Elyos? I cannot say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may doubt my vision, but I urge you to give it consideration. You have...an important role to play.</p>
