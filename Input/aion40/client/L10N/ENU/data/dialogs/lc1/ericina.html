          <p>Himusus is demanding that Pulo be punished.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pulo borrowed 100,000 Kinah from Himusus a month ago, to buy goods and set up a shop. He promised to repay Himusus from the profits of his venture.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Should Pulo be forced to pay that 100,000 Kinah back immediately, or not?</p>

          <p>You see, this is why I'm needed. Many people would answer as you have.</p>

          <p>But if I was representing Pulo, I would argue that the money is invested now. It's tied up in stock and other expenses. Pulo can't repay the loan overnight just because Himusus is impatient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Himusus agreed to accept a share of the profits as his repayment, and he should have understood that it could take time. Himusus must wait as he agreed to.</p>

          <p>If everyone saw it that way, good Daeva, there might be no need for lawyers like me. Many, though, would say that the money belongs to Himusus, so Pulo should be forced to pay it back.</p>
