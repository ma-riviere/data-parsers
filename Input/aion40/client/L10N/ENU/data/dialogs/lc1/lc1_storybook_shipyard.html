          <p>Jaspar, Daeva of Subterfuge</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jaspar was selected as a spy because of his Asmodian appearance: dark hair, pale skin and black wings. He was often sent into Asmodian-held fortresses in the Abyss to prepare them for assault. However, his appearance led certain Archons to doubt his loyalty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During an assault on Siel's East Wing. Jaspar was inside the fortress when a host of Balaur descended on the attacking Elyos. Heedless of his own safety, Jaspar leapt into the fray. His fate is unknown....</p>

          <p>Mustapino, Inventor of the Airship</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mustapino came from a talented family of alchemists and craftsmen. He was an amazing inventor, and the airship was the culmination of everything he had learned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Sanctum ordered him to create a military airship design, he refused, demanding that his inventions should only be used for peace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mustapino was put on trial for treason, but disappeared before he could be brought to court. It is said that he is still alive and inventing, letting other inventors take the credit for his discoveries.</p>

          <p>Aysha, Daeva of Sunlight</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aysha's father was an embalmer. She was with him one day when one of his charges awakened as an Undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took Aysha's father before her eyes, and she barely escaped with her life. After she ascended, she devoted herself to the destruction of Undead wherever they lurked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was said that wherever she went, the clouds could not hold back the sun, and her mere presence would heal the wounded and sicken the Undead. The story of how she reclaimed her lover from Death's grasp is recounted elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Dukofny, Daeva of Uncovering</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dukofny's sister had vanished when he was a child. All his life, he believed the Balaur were responsible and that his sister was still alive somewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he ascended, he made it his goal to uncover the secrets of the Balaur. His zealous quest has led him to many of the dark secrets of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, he has not yet found his sister.</p>

          <p>Benes, Daeva of Divine Clothing</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When she was Human, Benes was already a leading fashion designer. While Tailoring a marvelous brocade jacket one day, she ascended.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her shockingly revealing dresses and love of high heels have influenced fashion across Elysea, and her designs have even spread to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has never sought glory in the Abyss War, saying that fashion is her divine gift to the people of Elysea.</p>

          <p>Euripides, Daeva of Life Transformation</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No-one knows whether Euripides was born as a man or a woman. His gift is to shape the Aether in Daevas to reshape their features and body completely, and he practices on himself every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though presently he is a tall, strikingly handsome blonde-haired man, who knows what he shall be tomorrow.</p>

          <p>Ekoboros, Daeva of Hopeless Love</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The famous play about Ekoboros is only slightly exaggerated, Ekoboros did indeed fall hopelessly in love with Lady Ariel as soon as he set eyes upon her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whether his love for her actually caused him to ascend is impossible to say. Even all these centuries later, he has yet to win the heart of the Lady of Light.</p>

          <p>Sarano, Daeva of Avant-Garde Art</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sarano has always been a controversial figure in the Sanctum art world. Some claim his work is transcendently beautiful, others say it is blasphemous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Lords obviously agreed with the former, as he has been banished from Sanctum for four hundred years now.</p>

          <p>Zahada, Daeva of Architecture</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zahada first came to prominence with her redesign of Verteron Citadel. Her work was an instant hit, and she was commissioned to design the Lattice-Gate Towers that float along the western edge of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her work is at once bold and dynamic, defining Elyos architecture for centuries to come. Sadly, her life was cut short when a vacation in the Abyss turned to tragedy and she was caught without a Kisk.</p>

          <p>Pistacora, Daeva of Duels</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pistacora and his long-time rival ascended on the same day. No-one knows where their rivalry first began, but they would fight each other whenever they got the chance. Though they were constantly trying to kill one another, everyone who knew them said that it was as if they were best friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After they became Daevas, the topic of their rivalry was who should hold the title of "Daeva of Duels." Though they fought hundreds of duels as Daevas, none of them proved decisive because neither one could die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, they settled on one last duel in the furthest reaches of the Abyss. Fearing Displacement, no other Daevas came to watch the duel, but it was surely a battle for the ages. In the end, only Pistacora returned.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Haganetti revels in his gluttonous title. He has eaten himself to death many times over the course of his Daevahood, yet always resurrects at the Obelisk ready to plan another lavish banquet.</p>

          <p>Lapnitos, Daeva of Rural Life</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lapnitos was a farmer before he ascended and a farmer after he ascended. He didn't believe in what he called the "fancies and fripperies of Sanctum life," preferring a humble life in the country.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He tried to get more Daevas to follow his example, and for a time had a small farming community in the hills of Eltnen.</p>

          <p>Eschrilachitus, Daeva of Morality</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eschrilachitus was famous as "the most moral Daeva in Sanctum," a title he always shunned because he said that title properly belonged to the Empyrean Lords. He held strict moral standards and would not hesitate to criticize anyone who did not live up to his idea of morality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum was shocked when he was discovered to be responsible for a series of gruesome murders. When confronted, he violently resisted arrest, slaughtering all the Guardians in his path as he escaped the city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems that his worldview allowed for only good or evil, and he devoted himself wholeheartedly to both during his Daevahood.</p>
