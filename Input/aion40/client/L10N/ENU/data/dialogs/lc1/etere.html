        	<p>I've walked these streets many times since my ascension. I'm at peace now more than I ever was as a Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course I understand it's temporary. Soon I'll receive my first mission, and I'll have to leave Sanctum, possibly forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if I return, I'm not sure I'll ever be at peace like this again. I've seen what battle does to us. But if that's my duty, then so be it. A loyal Daeva must sacrifice for the good of all Elyos.</p>
