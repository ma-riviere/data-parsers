          <p>Daeva! Did you know Black Cloud Traders found way to take you to middle deck of Steel Rake, with Grogget's Safe and more?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ShulackShip_L_2F], upper and lower decks sealed off. So you can go without other Daevas competing for treasure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How that possible? Akakakak! It is secret! So how about it? Boat ready for you right now!</p>

          <p>Oh, sorry, Daeva. Cannot allow you to board right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are in Group, or have never gone to Steel Rake before, it is against policy to take you to Steel Rake Cabin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is liability issue. Hope you understand.</p>
