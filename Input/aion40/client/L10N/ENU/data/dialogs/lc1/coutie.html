          <p>"Clothes only enhance a Daeva. They can't work every miracle." That's what Andu tells me when we're having fittings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's so true. Some people can't pull off much at all. I, on other hand, am radiant in everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why Andu makes sure I try on his latest creations, I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're like me, [%username]. All clothing suits you. Would you like to try something on?</p>
