          <p>I. Introduction</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Notorious pirate captain, Captain Brass-Eye Grogget. Commander of The Steel Rake. Very suspicious, very deceitful. There is story that once he killed his own gunner--slit his throat, in sight of dock!--for rumor of something. Gunner not around to tell what rumor may have been.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This Shulack captain have eyes blacker than Abyss, heart smaller than half-Kinah coin. Sooner eat your ears--cut off with his steel rake hand!--than let you pass.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I, gentle Shalirinerk, infiltrated dangerous crew of Steel Rake under false name "Borabora."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many thanks to Jiriljinerk of Black Cloud Traders who edited my Elyos and published Complete Guide to The Steel Rake. Piracy bad for business, bad for customers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>EDITOR'S NOTE: I have tried to preserve the flavor of Shalirinerk's natural prose as much as possible.</p>

          <p>II. Who and How</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ruthless gang of Steel Rake part of larger ruthless gang of Shulack--The Steel Beard Pirates! Somewhere in Balaurea, The Steel Beard Pirates build huge fleet. Fleet so big, they can blot out view of whole layer in Reshanta, though never been tried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ships from The Steel Beard's enormous fleet run to-and-fro in the Abyss. Sometimes see each other and wave, sometimes do not. Always use heavy armaments and attack, attack, attack anyone else. EDITOR'S NOTE: Black Cloud Traders have lost much in the way of precious cargo like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of this fleet, three great ships create most stories for Shulack, but only one has ever been seen by non-Shulack. The one ship? Steel Rake! Very same ship with very scary Captain Grogget that I write here.</p>

          <p>Officers on The Steel Rake most competent. No slack for brave Shalirinerk/Borabora. All systems working at full efficiency, Captain!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1. Captain Grogget. You know him already, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>2. Engineer Lahulahu. Engineer Lahulahu always barking orders, cut all his hairs short as smooth leather (though growing out again now). Run here, run there. If pirates too slow, have Captain toss Shulack into Abyss. But good reason! Steel Rake's Drana Power Supply too volatile. One moment, good. Next moment, Steel Rake out of control!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>3. Chief Mate Menekiki. Chief Mate Menekiki watch over top deck of Steel Rake through eyes with flames for pupil. He say, "Board that ship!", and crew swift-fast go and board that ship! Always, Menekiki knows where is Steel Rake, where are targets. Savage crew must follow his instructions to win best prizes and survival.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>4. Chief Gunner Koakoa. Chief Gunner Koakoa perfectly placed for vicious, brawling mad-Shulack. Steel Rake has many firepowers more than any other ship in fleet, and Koakoa enjoys destructionizing in between fighting with crew mates.</p>

          <p>III. Ship's Layout</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Around firebins, gnawing on unidentified meat, Steel Rake's Shulack--pirates and snipers, magicians and lookouts--share stories. Shugo think they know all stories in Atreia? Shugo missing these! So I record here Shulacks story, may explain ship design.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Long ago, before the Cataclysm, Shulack lived different lives. We knew no hunger, no despair. We smiled and chattered like hostages at their last meals."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"We were weak. Pathetic."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But we had one skill that made our existence worthwhile: We built ships, and ours was the greatest shipyard under the gaze of Aion's Tower."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Then the Balaur came and freed us from our snivelling self-oppression! With the Cataclysm, our shipyard spiralled off into Balaurea, and we became the rough and tough Shulack we are today!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>EDITOR'S NOTE: I translated heavily the entire story above. The original manuscript is available to serious scholars upon request.</p>

          <p>This origination story may explain why Shulacks ships so magnificent. Steel Rake is biggest ship Shalirinerk ever seen, got lost once or twice. Why Shulack not make ship's map?</p>

          <p>Getting lost, I found many exotic places, and describe here the most important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cargo hold: Steel Rake is both merchantine and war vessel. Strong but slow, her cargo hold spans many decks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lower deck: Engineer Lahulahu runs this deck with a steel fist! Even prisoners in the brig cringe at his bark.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>Mid-deck: A Shugo favorite place to be, mid-deck is home to tavern of joyous stories and games. Also, good location for stumbling back to quarters on same deck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upper deck: Keep going up, up, up. There is tower on upper deck where Captain sleeps. He sees all, knows all. "Your plots to destroy him unfold before his Abyssian eyes!" says Captain Grogget.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>The ship clearly is designed for extended voyages--tavern!--and much fighting with guns and hand-to-hand. How far from home base in Balaurea does Steel Rake travel?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>EDITOR'S NOTE: The manuscript suggests dividing the amount of supplies in the cargo hold by the rate of supply consumption to determine approximately from where in Balaurea these pirates originate, but it does not provide enough detail for a reliable analysis.</p>

          <p>IV. Conclusions</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Conclusion: Run far and fast when you see The Steel Rake!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Akakak. Shalirinerk jokes. But only a bit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Rake ran aground on floating island in Aetheric Field, good folk had good fortune. Now we learn more of Steel Beard pirates and home of Shulack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This modest guide only first slice of roast Porgus. Much more to learn. Much more to understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shalirinerk hope to see more study from enterprising Shugos who make trip to Balaurea, but thinks pirate ship career enough adventure for this Shugo lifetime!</p>
