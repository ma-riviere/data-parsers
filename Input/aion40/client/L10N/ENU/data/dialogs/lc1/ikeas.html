          <p>Be proud and grateful, [%userclass]. The path whereon you stand was named by Lord Nezekan personally. He deemed it the Exalted Path.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In his own name he blessed it, so that the defeated who trudged home upon its stones should be freed from their burden of shame, and those who returned to Sanctum victorious should be exalted all the more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He watches over all, [%username]. All your deeds, even the lightest, the most seemingly trivial are weighed in the balance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Lord Nezekan never find you wanting!</p>
