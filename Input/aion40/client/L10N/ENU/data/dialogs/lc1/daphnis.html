          <p>Tailoring is the most rewarding of disciplines! Clothing can bring out elegance and beauty, convey emotion, and speak volumes about your station or taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tailoring is also practical. Simple cloth or leather, held together with humble stitches, can save your life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People seem to think it's an easy task just because the armor is light, but it's hardly so. A steel plate is impervious before the smith touches it, but to make armor from sobi or leather takes a master's hand.</p>

          <p>To sew properly, you must give your work complete attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you miss even a single stitch you could ruin the piece completely. Worse, you might fail to notice a flaw and cost a life on the battlefield.</p>
