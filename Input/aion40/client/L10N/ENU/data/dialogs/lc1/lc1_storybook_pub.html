          <p>There is an old phrase--"the right of a Daeva." Everyone knows what it means: Daevas have privileges that ordinary Humans cannot possess, both from Aion's blessing and society's hierarchy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet it seems that most Daevas have forgotten what it once meant: that Daevas had to uphold the moral right by sacrificing their well-being for the good of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In this book I have documented certain cases of Daevas abusing their privilege without regard for mortal lives. Though the information officers would wish these facts silenced, I feel it is every citizen's duty to remind the Daevas what "the right of a Daeva" truly means.</p>

          <p>Not long ago, a tragic case was reported in Eltnen. A woman's fianc√© ascended and decided that he would call off the engagement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The poor woman, overcome with grief and shame, threw herself off a cliff. Even more tragic, it was discovered that she was in the final stages of a pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The truly chilling aspect of the case was not the woman's death, but the Daevic reaction to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They scolded the woman for being naive. How could a Daeva, they said, be expected to remain shackled to his mortal affairs?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And these are the same Daeva we expect to protect us?</p>

          <p>The number of so-called "ascension training centers" grows rapidly across Elysea. These institutions advertise that they can teach their students to ascend through proper regimen of prayer and exercise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People of all ages pay shamelessly high tuition fees in hopes of immortality and power, and all that they recieve in return is overwork and motivational lectures.</p>

          <p>The blame for these centers lies not with the Humans who flock to them, but with the Empyrean Lords who turn a blind eye to these providers of false hopes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lords allow the centers to continue on the rare chance that one of them might find a method that works, to mass-produce Daevas to fight in the Abyss War.</p>

          <p>Some of you may remember the recent fraud case in Sanctum involving a well-respected Protector of Divinity. It was kept quiet at the time, but the truth emerged in scraps and fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems the honorable Protector had abused his position by demanding money in exchange for sacred rites, claiming that he knew special ways to attract Aion's favor. Many newly-ascended Daevas were blinded by his high position and taken in by his offer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he was on trial, his shameless defense was that the money was necessary for supporting the dignified lifestyle proper to a Daeva.</p>

          <p>Perhaps one of the most troubling aspects of Daeva society is the segregationist movement. This anti-Human movement is based on two arguments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, that Daevas and Humans need their own separate living spaces and education centers because they lead different lives, and second, that Humans must be separated from Daevas because they carry disease and engage in criminal activities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though these arguments are absurd to anyone with Human compassion, the segregationists strongly argue that Humans are unworthy to live around Daevas.</p>

          <p>In the past, many high-ranking Daevas of Sanctum have counted themselves segregationists. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though the movement has lost its vocal supporters, I have been told by certain sources that the movement continues in secret.</p>

          <p>It is not surprising to any knowledgeable person that great abilities are less important to success than an influential family background.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This holds true even among Daevas, and even among the Asmodians. In Pandaemonium, all the influential Daeva families live in the Vanahal District.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While many Asmodians still live in abject poverty, in Vanahal the dazzling lights never go out and the sweet music never stops.</p>

          <p>Daeva families have accumulated enormous fortunes over their immortal lifetimes, and their webs of favors and connections extend across Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They believe that as Daevas they are above the law and use their position to evade punishment, while ensuring that anyone who makes an enemy of them is punished beyond the maximum penalties of the law.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Balaur invade and the Aetheric Field falls, these Daevas will still be hosting lavish banquets and drinking rich liquers.</p>

          <p>I present to you, dear reader, a chilling fact. In ten years there will be more Daevas alive than Humans for the first time in the history of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I have shown, Daevas have abandoned their duties and demonstrate no concern for the well-being of their former charges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Humans, we will become an endangered underclass to be pitied or ignored.</p>

          <p>But not all is hopeless! There is one man who understands what is necessary to ensure a bright future for Atreia. That man's name is Lephar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you believe that Elysea is on the path to corruption or if you doubt the infallibility of the Empyrean Lords, then the Lepharists' doors are always open to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whether Human or Daeva, they shall welcome you into their fellowship, and together we shall strive to create a harmonious future for mortals and immortals alike.</p>
