          <p>Hild said she became a Ribbit after being mean to an old lady. She said she regretted it and wanted to be Human again. You thought Verdandi in Ishalgen was probably the one who made Hild a Ribbit, and you promised to ask the old lady for an antidote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Verdandi admitted making Hild into a Ribbit. But she didn't have the ingredients for the potion Hild would need. You got Vanargand's fur for Verdandi, she made a potion, and told you the potion would be useless unless Hild had changed her ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After drinking the potion, Hild became Human, but was still arrogant and was disrespectful to Verdandi. Hild immediately turned into a Ribbit again, and yelled at you to go away.</p>
