          <p>Kurngalfberg is infested with ghosts, the sad remnants of a bustling city. Unfortunately, they're interfering with our work here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've learned, through hard experience, that the ghosts are particularly vulnerable to fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Naturally, we began stockpiling scrolls of fire magic to help combat the haunts.</p>

          <p>So anyone can cast fire magic by using these scrolls? Fantastic news for these helpless fools.</p>
