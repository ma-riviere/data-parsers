          <p>I was abandoned at the Jamanok Inn when I was just a little girl, but Svidar took me in and raised me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He treats me like his daughter, but I still wonder about the parents who abandoned me from time to time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be forever grateful to Svidar...but I do hope he stops obsessing over Leowasp wings. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now, though, Svidar and I are committed to protecting the Crimson Temple, and I'm happy to be at his side.</p>
