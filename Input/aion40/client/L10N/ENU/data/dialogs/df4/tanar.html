          <p>Is that...is that a Dionae...at the edge of the camp? Move back, Daeva! I will protect us! Shards! Where did I put that stick?!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Poor Itar wants so much to conduct his research in the field, but I know he's frightened of the native beasts. It's good that he has his big brother here with him--otherwise I'm afraid he'd become a permanent resident.</p>
