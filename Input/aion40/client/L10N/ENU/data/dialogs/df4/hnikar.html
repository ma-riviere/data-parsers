          <p>Welcome, [%username]. Killed many Balaur lately? I've taken down a few myself, but I don't see too many around here lately. It seems you're doing all the hard work. Hah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I could be out there by your side. I feel like a priest, lately, sitting here talking to myself. Maybe I'll just disobey orders and go on a rampage one day. Wouldn't that be glorious!</p>
