          <p>I feel at peace for the first time in ages. It's not completely safe here, but safe enough to at least relax.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Sapiens are oddly kind, and we at least have Daevas watching over us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I will stay and help Rhonnam and the refugees. It's the least I can do to repay them for letting me live here.</p>
