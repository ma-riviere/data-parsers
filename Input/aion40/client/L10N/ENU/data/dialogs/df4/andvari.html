          <p>Why must everyone stare at my face. It's just a scar! You'd think that people would understand that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not ashamed--far from it. I wear this scar with pride. That's because it's from when I was mortal, before I ascended.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas fight without fear of true death, but back then any battle might have been my last. You want true glory? Put your life on the line!</p>
