          <p>It's odd, coming all the way here to Balaurea to handle coins. I always thought I'd fight on the front lines with the other Gladiators and Templars.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it's good to be here, helping Asmodae. And some of the places I've seen are surprisingly beautiful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I suppose you've come for rewards. Do you have coins to trade in?</p>

          <p>You'll need to speak with someone who handles rewards for your class if you want to spend coins.</p>

          <p>Well.... I suppose we can. We'll just have to be discreet about it, in case someone catches me goofing off on the job.</p>
