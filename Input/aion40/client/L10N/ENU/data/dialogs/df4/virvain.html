          <p>Ah, you want to try out the Empyrean Crucible, do you? You're either very brave or very reckless.</p>

          <p>But who knows--in times like this, maybe we need a little recklessness. Not too much, though. Wouldn't want to overdo it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Sorry, without the fee, you're not going anywhere. It's that simple.</p>

          <p>If it was up to me, I'd let it slide, but I don't make the rules.</p>
