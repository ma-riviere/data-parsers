          <p>Shugos stick together sometimes, Daeva, even if you  think we just care about Kinah. We help each other out when we can, yes yes.</p>

          <p>Barosunerk has helped Huarinrinerk before, and now he needs help...yes yes.... Got himself into trouble, lost his business, lost his Kinah. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not lost his friends though, no no. Now Huarinrinerk will help him.</p>

          <p>Barosunerk wants to start again. Has new business, but now needs items to sell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most profitable item in Beluslan is Malek ore, but Barosunerk cannot have that. Increasing the supply will decrease the price and decrease the profit, yes? Yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead, I have the perfect item for Barosunerk to sell--Malekor crystals! Akakak!</p>

          <p>Why? Because Malekor crystals are beautiful with a unique shimmer. Would be worth a fortune in Beluslan, except for the stupid stories....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Children's horror stories, yes? That's how it started. Now everyone in Beluslan thinks Malekor crystals have Balaur spirits inside, and carry curse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stupid stories ruin business opportunities, but make other opportunities. Stories are told in Beluslan, and Barosunerk is in Morheim, so we take him the crystals, he sells them, he makes Kinah, we make Kinah AND friends, yes?</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HolyServantAmethystD_35_An]s, have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2547a]s in them. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HolyServantAmethystBigD_36_An]s, they have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2547b]s in them, yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fetch 11 Red Crystals and 3 Blue Crystals. Take them all to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_7]. And remember, if he complains about the price, remind him we're doing him a favor! Akakak!</p>
