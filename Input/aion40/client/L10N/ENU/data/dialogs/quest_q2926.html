          <p>I just received this letter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, [%username],I can face Guardians, marauding beasts, collapsing portals, all without blinking an eye. This is different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's from Sadena. I haven't opened it yet, not since she refused my proposal.</p>

          <p>Hmm.... She says her family, the Vanahals, usually marry for political gain. She doesn't care about that, but she makes it clear that they wouldn't want her to marry a Daeva of mixed lineage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then she says if I really want to marry her... Listen--"Make me a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_love_heart] to prove your devotion to me and my family." </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if I make her a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_love_heart], she'll think about it. She does say that if I can't do it, she'd rather marry a lovesick Brax. But at least she's given me hope.</p>

          <p>It's...a legendary item--a heart sculpted using only the rarest jewels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's no trinket, [%username]--take my word for it. To gather the materials needed and craft the Heart in Love takes courage and dedication. But...if that's what it takes to change Sadena's mind, I have to try.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to craft a Heart in Love. You remember when I said I wouldn't need your help again? Well...I do. What do you say?</p>

          <p>First I need a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2926a] from a Rainbow Laupede at the Red Lava Cliff in Morheim. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2926d] is there as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll also need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2926b]. You'll find that in Beluslan, on Silver Granker Fawns. Lastly, um...the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2926c]? That's in Lake Asteria in Reshanta and, well...you'll have to fight a Medic for one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But collecting's the easy part. To make the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_love_heart], I'll have to work and refine them over and over again. It's extremely delicate work--one false move and the whole thing will be ruined!</p>

          <p>I just...I couldn't help getting my hopes up. The Shugo warned me. He said getting hold of a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_love_heart] is like trying to sell wings to a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
