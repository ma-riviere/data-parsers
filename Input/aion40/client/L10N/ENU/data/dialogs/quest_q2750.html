          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard much about your talents. Hmm...since you are here, perhaps you can show that you deserve those wings, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were sent here hastily to scout after Siel's Western Fortress fell into enemy's hands. However, we've run into some trouble.</p>

          <p>Our top priority is to recapture the fortress. When we send in our scouts they come back...rather confused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blasted [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1131_Specter_27_An]s are the problem. They attack us when we are in disguise so we can't protect ourselves. Then, when our scout is helpless, they confuse the scout's memories making the entire operation useless!</p>

          <p>Our mission requires absolute secrecy so we cannot attack them openly, lest the Ellies figure out what we're doing. You eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1131_Specter_27_An]s, we'll gather the intelligence needed to retake the fortress.</p>
