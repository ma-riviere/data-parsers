          <p>You know what I call Alquimia Research Center? "The Meat Grinder."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That place chews Daevas up and spits them out. It's filled to the gills with Lepharists who'd as soon rip out your heart as look at you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why it's the perfect place to send newbies for training!</p>

          <p>Trial by fire! Best kind of training there is! The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_G4_3] is my go-to area for promising Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But lately, there's been less "training" and more "slaughter." [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDF3LP_LehparEleShamanNmdDQ_45_Ae] is the cause of that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd hate to lose my training ground because of one Lepharist. Think you could take care of her for me so I can continue using it?</p>

          <p>I suppose Esras being sent there could be sort of my fault. My, er, students were really mowing them down at Alquimia for a while!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't look at me like that! The Daevas I send are always very capable! I don't believe in words like "impossible" or "reckless."</p>

          <p>But how about this: I'll give you a coin when you come back. Good deal, eh?</p>

          <p>This does get me thinking, though: what if I sent EVERY Daeva I know over at once?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think with enough of them, they could not only overwhelm the High Priest, but every other Lepharist at Alquimia! What do you think?</p>

          <p>I may massage the truth...a little...but it's for their own good! And Asmodae's! You think great Daevas spring up every day?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as High Priest Esras is defeated, I'll be sending them right back there again! Speaking of which...?</p>
