          <p>I'm sure you've seen all the ghosts here. Most are those who lost their life when Kurngalfberg was cursed and turned into a giant block of ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it isn't their fault, but they invariably interfere with the work of melting the Ice City. We've been forced to get rid of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The upside of this is that while fighting these ghosts. we learned that they are very vulnerable to fire magic. We made a number of scrolls containing fire magic to use in battle, and they were very effective.</p>

          <p>I think these scrolls might be useful in several other places too, but I'm not familiar with the situation in Beluslan yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think if I send these to the fortress, they'll know better where to distribute them.</p>

          <p>He made some flame magic scrolls that are effective against the undead? That's great. I think [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sleipnirr] in The Whispering Forest might find them useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The region teems with undead, so the Archons there suffering from a lack of manpower will find these very helpful.</p>

          <p>Distributing the scrolls to the villagers there would be good too, I believe.</p>

          <p>It's not easy protecting the villagers from the attacks. There is a Watch, but to be honest they aren't much of a help.</p>

          <p>All right, so first one to each villager for use in emergency, and then....Oh, wait!</p>

          <p>A Daeva of Flame, Tafi, used the knowledge gained from fighting against ancient ghosts to create scrolls containing fire magic that are effective in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He thought those scrolls might be useful in several other places as well, but as he wasn't familiar with the situation in Beluslan he said it would be best to deliver them to Centurion Hod in the fortress to distribute them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to see Centurion Hod, and he said the scrolls would be helpful to Centurion Sleipnir who is in The Whispering Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you delivered the scrolls to Sleipnir, he said he would distribute them to the villagers for emergencies and thanked you for bringing them.</p>
