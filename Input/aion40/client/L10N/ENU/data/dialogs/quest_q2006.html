          <p>We're not working fast enough, apparently. Ulgorn asked me to organize another raid against the Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only those blasted fools had succeeded the first time. Or at least stood up for themselves like the gritty raiders they claim to be!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, because of their incompetence, Ulgorn is pressuring this whole camp to do something we wouldn't normally do.</p>

          <p>The Mau are holed up in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA192] because they can farm Odella there. We've taken some of their Odella, but now I want to hit their food supply so they have to leave Ishalgen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't just destroy it, though. Take it! Mau grain is somehow more nourishing than our grain--something to do with Aether infusing their crop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no farmer, but think about it. If we got our hands on a food source like that, even Vanar might have the energy to do something useful.</p>

          <p>I told Ulgorn you were spearheading our mission, and he'll hold you personally responsible if we lose this camp. Of course, succeed and Ulgorn will reward you handsomely, too.</p>

          <p>More importantly, you sent a message to the Mau. When they realize that we plundered their crops from inside their own base, the Mau will definitely think twice about invading the crossing.</p>
