          <p> </p>
          <p>I was looking for someone to do a job for me. It's not difficult, and if you were already heading to the Kabarah Strip Mine, then it won't take long for you to do at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, please listen. It's Melponeh, she's... she's...</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, I'm finding this whole thing difficult to deal with.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have an ointment here that needs to be given to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA11]. She was attacked during a [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA10] raid, and now, it seems as though her wounds have become infected. To be honest, if she doesn't receive this treatment, Melponeh may soon... she may soon die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please... please take the ointment to her, [%username]. You'll find her near the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07].</p>

          <p>Oh, and be careful, [%username]. The [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA10]s that hurt Melponeh are highly aggressive and will likely attack you on sight. Melponeh needs to get better, but you also need to not get hurt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have the Kinah, I'd suggest you speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kustanon] about a quick flight path.</p>

          <p>You've never used flight before? Interesting.</p>

          <p>It's simple, mercenary. I can send you to Melponeh's Campsite using specific channels of the aetherstream. Every region has its own paths, though we only usually bother establishing paths when they lead to or near populated areas.</p>
