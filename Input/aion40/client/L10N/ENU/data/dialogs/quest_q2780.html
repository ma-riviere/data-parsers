          <p>It's a shame the Roah Fortress is still in the enemy's hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the closest fortress to the Western Shard of Latesran, Roah's strategic advantage is high. The western ridge could fall into their hands in no time at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To prevent such a disaster, we must stop them from expanding out.</p>

          <p>Well, specifically... you. I'd like to ask you to take out a few enemy guards in and around the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, nobody's going to complain if you kill the Guardian General as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use whatever means available. Just remember one thing, it's too dangerous to go alone. Gather allies and go together. Do you understand?</p>

          <p>Okay. Controlling their resources is the best way to control their influence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go brief your allies about the mission. Then defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2780_all].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be patient and pace yourself. The defenses of the fortress are stronger than you might think.</p>
