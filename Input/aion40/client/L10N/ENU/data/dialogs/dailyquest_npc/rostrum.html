          <p>As Field Warden Registrar, I primarily handle recruitment efforts and exit interviews. Since you can sign up or leave at any time, I'm fairly busy!</p>

          <p>If you have general questions, go ahead and ask. Of course, I can only give out certain information to other Field Wardens....</p>

          <p>Well, our primary stated duty is to monitor Asmodae's Aetheric Field, and thereby protect Asmodae from harm. As long as the Field survives, so will we.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Pandaemonium supports our efforts, and we theirs, they don't dictate our agenda. We are in essence a private...security force. All tasks are assigned confidentially via mail, and we never disclose information to non-members--not even to lord Vidar himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This arrangement allows us to...operate as we see fit, but in the end we all have the same goal: protecting Asmodae. Isn't that what's important?</p>
