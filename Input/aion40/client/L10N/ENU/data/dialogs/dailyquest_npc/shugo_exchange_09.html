          <p>Hmmm, Raffinerk did not really think this trip through, nyerk. Thought I could get many tokens for collection cheaply and quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Balaurea very dangerous place. Had to spend much Kinah for protection and transportation to places for trading!</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now Raffinerk almost broke. Not enough Kinah for trip back! Must set up side-business to get home...and keep on trading while here, of course!</p>
