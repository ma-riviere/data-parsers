          <p>Some say that The Circle helps Daevas just for the rewards.</p>

          <p> </p>          
          <p>And the rewards also enable us to stay strong and continue our good work. Like this armor, for instance...?</p>

          <p>This isn't your lucky day, friend. I can't help you with what you need.</p>
