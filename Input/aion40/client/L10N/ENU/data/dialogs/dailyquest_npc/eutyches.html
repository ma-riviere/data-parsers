          <p>But don't let them pile up too high in your cube. Like Kinah, Tokens are meant to be spent.</p>

          <p>Tokens are meant to be spent. Unfortunately, you can't spend them with me. Talk to another reward officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or you can talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos], if you want to know more about the Fortuneers.</p>
