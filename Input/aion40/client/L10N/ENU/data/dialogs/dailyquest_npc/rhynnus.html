          <p>Greetings, Daeva. It's good to see you well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taking some time off from fighting? Most Wardens seem to turn tokens in for Arms or Armor, and since I take care of the other stuff, I sort of get left out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that I mind. It gives me time to think...about...stuff.... Like...errr....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, do you have tokens?</p>

          <p>Please enter /petition in your Chat window and inform a GM.</p>

          <p>I'm counting on you, [%username], to help me.</p>

          <p>I might not be the brightest bulb on the tree, but I know when I'm being scammed. I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should go talk with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum]? No other Field Warden's gonna really even talk to you right now.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now go away. I have philosophisizing to do. If an Elim falls in the forest and no one's around to hear it, does he make a sound...?</p>
