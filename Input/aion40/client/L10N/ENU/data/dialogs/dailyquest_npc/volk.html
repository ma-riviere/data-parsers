          <p>I was mocked for being a member of The Circle recently. Those short-maned idiots have no idea what we're about.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>"Hand-holders," they called us. I'd like to hold their hands...and chop 'em off for insulting us like that.</p>  
          <p> </p>  
          <p>Best way to prove them wrong is by example. Get some of this armor and vanquish in the name of The Circle.</p>

          <p>So do YOU think The Circle's a bunch of nannies and snot-wipers?</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Sorry. I'm just in a foul mood. But regardless, you can't use my services.</p>

          <p>Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Petarca] in Pandaemonium about our group. Maybe you could join. We could use some strong bodies in our ranks.</p>
