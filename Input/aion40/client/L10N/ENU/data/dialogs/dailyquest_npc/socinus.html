          <p>Ahhh, look around you! Isn't Inggison lovely? All the flora are blooming, and the air smells of sweet nectar and shiny Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This city has so much to offer us Fortuneers. So many undiscovered treasures, so many criminals, so many filthy Asmodians--so much work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Fortuneers don't fear any place as long as there's a good bounty involved. I just wish Inggison had a good tavern.</p>
