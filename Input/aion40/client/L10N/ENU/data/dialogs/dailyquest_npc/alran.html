          <p>I have some great new designs in. Some real claws to them if you're interested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sell only the best designs and products for the Shapers of Dusk. My prices are fair as a benefit to members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll notice two types of designs: the one with the higher price reduces the chance of failure. What do you need?</p>
