          <p>We found this cute kid, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Paeru], wandering outside the fortress, alone and crying. He told us his dad was missing.</p>

          <p>The dad's name is Strahein. There've been a lot of rumors about missing people, but nobody really knows anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't been able to speak to him---he cries every time an Archon asks him about his dad. Maybe you could talk to him for me?</p>

          <p>Mani had you investigate the disappearance of young Paeru's father, Strahein. You found out that he had gone to join the Lepharists, who were promising ascension for all. After investigating the site and interrogating a Lepharist prisoner, you discovered those who wanted to ascend were being taken to a secret research center. You hurried there, and saw Strahein being loaded onto an airship.</p>
