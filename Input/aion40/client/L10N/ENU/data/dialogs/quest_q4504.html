          <p>Hey, Daeva, I've got a favor to ask. Remember that job you did for me? Y'know, at Alukina's Palace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm looking to sell some more coral. You up to going back in and retrieving some?</p>

          <p>I know, I know. But it's not like we'll get rich gathering Xilix or Pressa. Besides, I've got a new buyer. This time for sure we'll make big Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You bring back 9 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2585a], I'll split the proceeds with you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it? I'm being very generous, all things considered.</p>

          <p>Great! Remember, it's pretty dangerous down there, so you might want some friends around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't tell them why you're there! We can't have everyone and his brother breaking apart [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_Coral_Q2585]s for [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2585a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do this for me, and I'll make sure you're paid well this time.</p>

          <p>Here, take this. I know it's not a fortune, but since I haven't met the buyer yet, this is all I can give you in advance. You did want your pay now, right?</p>

          <p>You got him the coral he wanted. He liked this batch better, though he skimped a little on your reward again, saying it was for your benefit so you wouldn't have to wait for him to meet his buyer.</p>
