          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. It looks like our strategy against the Lepharists is working well. My reports indicate they're having trouble even coordinating their guard rotations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This mission is punitive. There are a couple of Lepharists we want to...punish.</p>

          <p>You may be aware that there have been a lot of kidnappings in Eltnen lately. We've traced most of them to the citadel. They're worked to death, and if they get injured they're used as test subjects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Victims who have escaped identify the man in charge as [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparRaNamedQ_40_Ae]. He's committed unpardonable atrocities, and it's time for him to face justice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to get in there and kill the Supervisor.</p>

          <p>There's a second target too--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparKnNamedQ_40_Ae]. He was once a faithful Guardian and defended a remote village, but joined the Lepharist Revolutionaries for unknown reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Truthfully, I don't care why he joined. He's now the right-hand man of Head Supervisor Panteros and is a clear obstacle in our plans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Show everyone what we do to to traitors, and kill Luitra.</p>
