          <p>Of all the triggers that awaken people into Daevahood, the most common is a personal crisis or massive mental shock. A second birth, really, only this time you feel the agony, not your mother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Indulge my curiosity, young Daeva. What provoked your ascension?</p>

          <p>You ascended because of Munin? This complicates matters...complicates them severely....</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>As a [%userclass], you understand that names have power, yes? For your own good, do not mention Munin's name in Pandaemonium.</p>
        <p> </p>
          <p>Munin's numerous enemies sent him into exile and erased his name from books of lore because of his prophecy about the thirteenth Empyrean Lord.</p>

          <p>A ridiculous fantasy, nothing more. Don't trouble your mind with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rather than such fantasies, you should concern yourself with one pressing reality--your magic is a wild thing, and will struggle out of your hands and bite you unless you grasp it firmly...control it utterly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plenty of Archons expect you to lose control. I look forward to throwing their words back in their faces. Here's your chance: you're being sent to Altgard Fortress.</p>

          <p>Altgard Fortress is the proverbial deep part of the river, is it not? I expect it has something to do with certain shady characters in your recent past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best not make a fuss about it--it's only Altgard, not the Abyss. If anyone asks, tell them in proper Asmodian fashion that you welcome the chance to grow strong through adversity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I think I see the answer in your eyes, but...will you accept your first posting?</p>

          <p>You already have one blot on your record, and written next to it is the name "Munin." Do you really want to disgrace yourself further?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen many young Daevas dispatched to Altgard, and not all of them have come back. Yet before today, I never saw a young Daeva doing any less than duty demands. Your cowardice shames their memory..."Daeva."</p>

          <p>Heimdall's already written to me about you. Looks like he thought you could use a guiding hand. "Go easy on [%username]," it says here. "Relatively inexperienced. Recent ascension."</p>
