          <p>If I'm going to run this fortress one day, I need to build up a good profit base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I consider myself a talented merchant. I know my business and my customers, and I carry only the best quality stock. But recently, my bottom line's been taking a beating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's disconcerting.</p>

          <p>You can't play the politics game without a solid Kinah base, and selling groceries is just not cutting it. I need something with a higher profit margin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't look now, but Shaoranyerk over there, she made a killing selling jewels to rich fops. And I've got better marketing skills than she does.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've read in the tabloids that fans made of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FrillfaimamFemale_23_An] manes are popular as well as pricey. Shall we try it?</p>

          <p>Great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's start with five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3320a]s. That'll be enough to see if they're strong sellers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and be careful with the manes. Quality counts in merchandising.</p>

          <p>If this works, I'll be able to run for city council next season!</p>
