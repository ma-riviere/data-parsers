          <p>You'll be able to produce a superb [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2978all] if you keep cooking Lainita's Salad, Lainita's Smoothie, and Lainita's Fish. Serving these dishes together will be quite the challenge...they'll require a delicate touch with seasonings!</p>

         <p>If you want to become an Expert in two areas, you must first complete one expert course before starting another.</p>
