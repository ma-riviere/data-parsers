          <p>Well, I have a reptile phobia. Just looking at them makes me dizzy. I know, it sounds silly to be afraid of such things when I handle the undead every day, but quite frankly, they just give me the chills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to ruin my credibility by speaking up, but I'm having a hard time doing the job I came to do with those...things...around.</p>
