          <p>[%username]! So good to see you. It's been ages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What have you been up to?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me? Not much, guard duty, and more guard duty. Important work, but rather dull. I've been thinking of picking up a hobby to help pass the hours.</p>

          <p>Carving, I think. Low equipment needs, portable, easy to set aside on a moment's notice. A good fit for a guard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, have you seen the Horned Tipolid's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3336A]s? They're gorgeous! The horn is a dull red in the light, but after dark, it glows in these incredible soft red swirls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm itching to get started...you wouldn't by chance be willing to fetch me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3336A]s, would you?</p>

          <p>Great! I've got my carving kit right here. I've just been having troubles breaking away to fetch the raw materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could bring me a few of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_hippolizardRe_35_An] [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3336A]s, I can get working.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it carves as smoothly as I think it will, I'll be able to crank out some beautiful gifts for the villagers. They could use a pick-me-up.</p>
