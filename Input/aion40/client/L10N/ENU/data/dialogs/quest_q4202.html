          <p>I wish I knew how to explain this to my customers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sandblossom Wine is a favorite here at the Apellbine. They're going to be terribly disappointed. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You'll have some next year," I'll tell them. Oh, I can just imagine their reaction to that.... </p>

          <p>What's so special about Sandblossom Wine? Only someone who's never tried it would ask that question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's made from flowers that bloom for a very short time just once a year. Workers gather them all night on the night they bloom, because in the morning, the sun will scorch them to a crisp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the perfect sweetness and the perfect taste. It's rare, it's exquisite, and it's not something customers want to wait for.</p>
