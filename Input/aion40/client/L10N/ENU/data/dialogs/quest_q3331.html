          <p>What? Oh, I'm all right. I'm just not sure what to do next.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought I'd be able to make a good living raising Qooqoos, but the profit margin is just not there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've considered moving back to Sanctum, but I really like it here in the village.</p>

          <p>I've been thinking about that. I've heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3331A]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mudthorn_33_An]s can be used to make antidotes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's lots of Mudthorns near the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you think I could make a profit selling Poisonous Stingers?</p>

          <p>That's what I thought, but the catch is that I'm totally unqualified to hunt Mudthorns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you give me a hand getting started? If you could hunt down some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mudthorn_33_An]s and bring me a batch of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3331A]s, I could sell those as a proof of concept.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, once I have some Kinah flow, I can recruit full time hunters.</p>
