          <p>Oh, I'm glad you're here, [%username]! At the end of the note you brought me from Vivi, he asked if I might send more fish.</p>

          <p>He thanked me for the Roast Gadill and said it was delicious, and that he'd just love to have some Roast Dorado.</p>

          <p>Oh it is. Catching Dorado is usually no problem for me, but....</p>

          <p>I have to go to the Altgard Fortress for an appointment. There's a merchant who sells rare bait, and he's meeting me there. If I don't show up, he'll go on with his travels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just don't have the time to fish for Dorado right now. Could you do me one more favor, [%username]? Really, it's my last request.</p>
