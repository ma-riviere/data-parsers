          <p>Sheesh! These pilgrims are such a pain! I know...religion, pilgrimages...important. Lah dee dah dah... But seriously, some of them have no more brains than a half-grown Mau!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Attacks are down at any rate, since we've started issuing leather armor to all pilgrims. Makes Tipolid Skins worth their weight in gold around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the pilgrims are pouring in so fast, we keep running out of Skins.</p>

          <p>Why yesss... Would you, by chance, be interested in helping us to obtain more leather materials, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could certainly use the help. We've got our hands full just making armor and herding pilgrims.... And the Lords do tend to get cranky at Daevas who let pilgrims get munched by Basilisks.</p>

          <p>Sorry, where was I? Oh yes, could you bring us seven [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1381a]s? The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_hippolizardCh_29_An] skin is best. Mottled Tipolids are soft, but make for lousy armor.</p>
