          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a ferocious Tigric named Aeution Firemane. He has a rather violent reputation, but then again...so do you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Changarnerk Shugos were robbed by Aeution on their way to Sanctum.</p>

          <p>Needless to say, Shoranarerk, who's in charge of the region, was censured for not protecting the caravan.</p>
