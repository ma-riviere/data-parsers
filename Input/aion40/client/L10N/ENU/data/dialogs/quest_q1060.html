          <p>Greetings, [%username]. I have a quest and I need a skilled Daeva to accomplish it.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Priest Sulates in the fortress contacted me, praising your abilities. He said you would be able to help me kill Bollvig.</p>

          <p>We must. The Storm Circle has fallen completely into his hands, and while he cannot now turn our people into his minions, he still commands an army of Undead. We must strike now before he can rebuild the Obelisk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We cannot send just anyone to fight him. His minions are legion and very dangerous, and we can't risk any more of our soldiers than necessary. It takes someone with your talents, [%username], to succeed in a mission like this.</p>

          <p>According to our investigation, Bollvig is always on the floating island, surveying his troops. Once inside The Storm Circle, you will need to fly to the island and attack him there. This is dangerous, of course, but there is no alternative.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bollvig is strong--possibly stronger than anyone you've faced. I urge you to find companions you can trust to assist you--even with your skills, it isn't something to attempt alone. And check with Quartermaster [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ekseus]. He has something for you that may be useful.</p>

          <p>So you're [%username]? Faith and arms, but you're in for a fight. You know, Bollvig's the whole reason the Blue Fleet came here in the first place. Still haven't been able to do it...tweaks the admiral proper, it does. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not sure where you'll be able to succeed where the Blue Fleet failed, but it's not my place to question the admiral. If you're going to pull this off, though, you'll need some help.</p>

          <p>No! I mean, yes, but no. Your reputation is well deserved, [%username], and I never doubted your ability. But others before you have been skilled and Aion-favored as well, only to join Bollvig's Undead army.</p>
