          <p>We've made promising advances in finding the source of the contamination. A scientist's job is never done, though, and there is still much work to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So far we have collected tissue samples from the local Frillneck and Worg populations. We still need to study other species, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum has asked for one specific creature.</p>

          <p>We need to get a sample of an Arachna.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are sturdy creatures, with their own poison sacs. I want to see if they've adapted to the poisons in the area and, if they have, if they've incorporated it into their venom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alternatively, it may become apparent that Arachna poison somehow counters the effects of the contaminants. If that is the case, then we'll need to study the poison and see if we can synthesize the key components ourselves.</p>

          <p>Our progress has improved markedly of late, but there are still some key steps to take if we are to solve the problems in this region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, do you think you can help us? I'll need an Arachna poison sac, which shouldn't take you too long to gather.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I'll be prepared for the analysis by the time you return.</p>

          <p>Remember, to find the main groups of [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA154]s, you need to head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA16_1]. They'll be on the roadside as you head to the Altar, so you'll need to keep your wits about you.</p>

          <p>Shame....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so very important that we fully understand the biological makeup of other creatures, especially when they have so much to teach us about the environment. We are the way we are because we have opened our mind to progress, [%username].</p>
