          <p>I'm a hunter, and a hunter needs to keep moving, right? But have you tasted the dumplings here?</p>

          <p>Well...I met [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jahmanok], too. She's really...special, you know?</p>

          <p>An exceptional woman like [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jahmanok] might be picky about her men. I don't know what I could do to impress her.</p>

          <p>That's very kind of you. I'm sure [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jahmanok] will feel comfortable with you. I get so flustered around her, I think I make her nervous.</p>
