          <p>"Defend your hometown," my father always told me. "It was once your cradle, and it will someday be your grave."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What he didn't tell me was that I'd be fighting logistics and paperwork more often than monsters and marauders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just yesterday I got a request for supplies from the Watch of Tolbas Village. I had to fill out twelve different forms just to get the weapons here.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Tolbas got tired of asking us for help whenever they were attacked by monsters, so they formed a Watch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're enthusiastic, at least. Since they're only requesting supplies and not manpower, Spatalos has decided to help them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're led by [%dic:STR_DIC_LA24]. I acquired the weapons, but now I need someone to take them to the village for me.</p>

          <p>Well, now I'm going to have to spend another hour on courier requisition forms. The next time the Watch breaks their swords, they'll need to to fix them themselves.</p>
