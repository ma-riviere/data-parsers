          <p>The Deathchant Legion sent me over as soon as we heard about [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun]. I was going to ask you to help clear it out and retake it...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you already look ready to go! You must know what I'm about to ask before I even ask it. A psychic!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just to clarify for the less blessed, will you undertake this mission to kill members of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q30511_ALL] and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30511A]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That way, we can keep track of kills and record how close we are to clearing out the entire Outpost.</p>

          <p>That was quick! Of course, with your psychic abilities, I'm sure this was easy for you!</p>

          <p>Now, if you'd give me the Vasharti Seals you collected...?</p>

          <p>Your psychic abilities came in handy, didn't they?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we'll need to keep up the pressure. I'm sure I can count on you to help in the future. Hey, maybe I'm psychic too!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, really. What if I AM psychic? That would be great for my career...</p>
