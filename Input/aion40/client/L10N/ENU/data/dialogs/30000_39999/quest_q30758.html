          <p>Oh, it's you--the Daeva who wrecked my lab. Come back to finish the job now?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're not? Well, in that case, maybe you'd be willing to help me? It's the least you could do. After you wrecked my lab, I decided maybe I should kill Tiamat and take over! Then I could rebuild my lab bigger and better than before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should have known Laksyaka was setting me up. Please, Daeva, go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_S4_1] and free the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDTiamat_Drakan_Surama_1]s. They can help you get my revenge against [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Rakshaka_Named_60_Ah].</p>

          <p>My life has no meaning with Commander Surama dead. All I want is to see Tiamat dead, and Laksyaka's treachery avenged.</p>

          <p>Good, it's a start. Laksyaka's treachery to my commander was unforgivable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it weren't for Laksyaka's meddling, Commander Surama would surely have replaced Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, Daeva. At least a part of my vengeance has been completed.</p>

          <p>Surama asked you to rescue his imprisoned men from the prison camp, and to take revenge on Brigade General Laksyaka.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>Surama wasn't strong enough to fight Laksyaka, and he died after the battle.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>You killed Laksyaka in revenge, and his follower Murugan thanked you.</p>
