          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something unthinkable has happened. A group of Lepharist Revolutionaries attacked one of our high-ranking Daevas and stole an Activity Report.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, the stolen report is protected by a spell that causes an explosion should an unauthorized person attempt to break its seal...and now we hear reports of a mysterious explosion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, [%username], member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to search the main roads of Inggison for any [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35022] and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make haste, for the contents of this document must remain concealed from those who would harm Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the good of all Elyos!</p>

          <p>Look, the information officer said there was an explosion on one of Inggison's main roads. Do you like the idea of Lepharist Revolutionaries working so close by?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Alabaster Order needs you to search for those Torn Pieces, [%username]. Even if you have to search every main road in Inggison.</p>

          <p>Thank Aion this didn't get more serious, but you can be sure that Alabaster Order security is going to toughen up.</p>

          <p>Please take this as a reward for helping us solve this dangerous problem.</p>

          <p>A call to action from the Alabaster Order said Lepharist Revolutionaries attacked one of their Daevas and stole an Activity Report. The report was spelled to explode when opened by anyone other than an Order member, and there were reports of an explosion on one of the main roads of Inggison. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You collected the Report Scraps from Inggison and delivered them to Eriphyle or Tersichore for a reward. </p>
