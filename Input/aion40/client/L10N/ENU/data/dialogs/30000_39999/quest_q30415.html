          <p>You know, in pursuit of dream, I ask many questions, hear many rumors. Recently heard something very interesting!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You maybe seen huge rock in Elementis Forest? It used to be Kalgolem. Kalgolems rocks made alive. But somehow this one got trapped in bigger rock!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you smash [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Nmd_RollingStone_60_Al], original Terma comes out! But more interesting, hear that you can find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30415A] in rubble after!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is part of Terma broken off, and is very valuable! If you can get, will split profit with you! Very fair, yes?</p>

          <p>Aha, you came back, Daeva! You did not run off with Illusion Crystal on your own and leave Sesinerk holding bag!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I knew you were gull... uh, honest Daeva! Shugos love dealing with Daevas like you! Always appreciate integrity!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what does Illusion Crystal look like? Is it pretty, nyerk? Does it shine with great power?</p>

          <p>Ooooh, it is pretty! Wonder why it is called Illusion Crystal? Does it make illusions? Does not look like it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, maybe will sell... uh, send to bosses. Maybe there is some special power that they can unlock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This should make Sesinerk lots of Kinah to spend on searching for dream! Many thanks to Daeva... in form of reward!</p>

          <p>Sesinerk said that an imprisoned Kalgolem called Trapped Terma could be freed. Doing so would also free a valuable Illusion Crystal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You shattered Terma's prison, collected the Crystal from the rubble, and gave it to a grateful Sesinerk.</p>
