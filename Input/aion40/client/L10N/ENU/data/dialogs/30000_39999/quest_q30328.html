          <p>For a Spiritmaster, the only way to achieve true greatness is to discover a new Spirit. That's why I came to Gelkmaros!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My achievements as a Daeva may have been lackluster so far, but if I can discover a Spirit unique to Balaurea...imagine what that would do for my reputation!</p>

          <p>Yes, that too. But back on topic--I need special materials to summon up new spirits, but the dangers here in Gelkmaros prevent me from going out myself. I know my limits!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can bring me what I need, I can do the summoning here. I'll gladly give you credit for assisting with my research. What do you say?</p>

          <p>All right then, the first thing I need is 30 intact [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30328a]s. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Cellatu_DR_54_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_CellatuDR_Baby_54_An]s at Viscum Swamp would be an ideal source.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the Opaque Bladders, I should be able to summon a Balic Water Spirit. Hurry back!</p>

          <p>That's just what I need! No, don't go, I'll try a summoning right now....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There, did you see it? No? Oh, of course you didn't. The water spirit appeared inside an Opaque Bladder. If only I had used a Transparent Bladder....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I sensed it was there, and that's all that matters. I can now summon a completely unique Balic Water Spirit, albeit a very small one. Thanks!</p>
