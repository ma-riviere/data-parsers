          <p>Finally, I can march right into Elementis Forest right now and capture a Glowing Spirit all by myself! No reason why I can't!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Except... er... I've been in contact with Lumen. He wants me to collaborate on a paper with him. This could mean great things!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could ask you a favor, could you capture one of those cuddly... I mean, rare Spirits for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just use the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30407A] on a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_ElementalLightM_60_Ah]. It's that simple!</p>

          <p>Oh! Daeva! You startled me! I was just thinking out loud. About nothing in particular, really.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Show it to me now. Yes, right now. I want to gaze upon the... triumph of my career! Yes, that's it--career.</p>

          <p>Lumen sees these Spirits only as subjects of study. Which they are, of course, but they're so much more!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Couldn't you watch them all day long? Their behavior, I mean! Because there's certainly nothing interesting about their looks....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of which, I got so caught up in other things, I didn't give you your reward. I expect you want it?</p>

          <p>Look at that face. Look at that face! Isn't that just the most heartwarm- er, I mean, interesting thing you've ever seen?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this isn't the end of it! How could it be, with so many more Spirits out there to capture?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lumen, I'm sure, would also appreciate your help in the future. In the meantime, take this. You've earned it, definitely!</p>

          <p>You captured a Glowing Spirit and brought it back to Sulos, who was oddly delighted at something. It really made you wonder....</p>
