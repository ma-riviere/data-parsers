          <p>Now Sesinerk heard something interesting! Remember Terma, Kalgolem with Illusion Crystal?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Nmd_RollingStone_60_Al] is stuck in rock again. Sad, huh, nyerk?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Sesinerk hears you can get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30421A] from rubble now. It is getting much talk as toy for elite in Kamar!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Sesinerk can sell Miniature Terma, it is big step towards finding a way to make her dream come true! Will Daeva help?</p>
