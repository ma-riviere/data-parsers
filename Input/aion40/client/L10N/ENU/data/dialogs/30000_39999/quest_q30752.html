          <p>Hello [%username]. I understand you may be leaving for the Tiamat Stronghold soon. Inside the stronghold is the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_S3], where orders are given to both the Chantra and Terath Dredgions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must know if there is an attack being planned. When you get to the Control Center, use the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDTiamat_FOBJ_Model] to find the route the Dredgions will take, and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Sardha_Named_60_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Report your findings to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Briet]. She'll reward you appropriately.</p>

          <p>This is true? If Terath is dead, then we won't have to worry about those Dredgions for a while. Except...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those routes, are you sure about them? That would mean that the last Terath Dredgion has already departed, and will be here soon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to ensure that we prepare countermeasures immediately.</p>

          <p>Briet was having a hard time with the Dredgions, so Sorus asked you to find their attack routes, kill Brigade General Terath, and bring the information to Briet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Briet was overjoyed that future Dredgions had been halted, but the last Terath Dredgion had already departed the base. Briet needed to make immediate battle plans for its arrival.</p>
