          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your vigorous efforts, we have been successful in promoting the well-being of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To build on this success, the Alabaster Order has commissioned Walking Encyclopedia Fuchsia to invent a device called the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35021]. The Eye activates when a non-Elyos passes by, and then it records the features of the suspicious trespasser.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to retrieve the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35021]'s memory records in Inggison and bring them to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion calls us to act swiftly! </p>

          <p>Weren't you supposed to retrieve the Guarding Eye's memory records?</p>

          <p>Yes, gatekeepers and fortress guards keep a lookout for the enemy, but we installed the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35021] at that location for a reason.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Through all that haze, I can barely see, but...there! Is that a wing? A black wing?</p>
