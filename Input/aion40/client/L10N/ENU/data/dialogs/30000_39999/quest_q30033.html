          <p>Daeva, have I mentioned to you how annoying life can be sometimes? I'm a surgeon, yes? I treat soldiers, and that's a pretty complicated, time-consuming occupation...especially out here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now, apparently I'm also the local administration officer. I was told to hand out operations when I wasn't...healing our wounded!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seriously! Come on! I'm a doctor!</p>

          <p>Well, I'm pulling the weight of two Daevas now! So, guess what? I'm handing you an operation, [%username]. I know you can handle it, and I need this off my plate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're familiar with the Jotun Studio...in the Lower Udas Temple? And you know what the Jotun are, yes? Great! You're hired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are some...things interfering with our research down there. Can you dispose of them?</p>

          <p>It's not the Jotun that are causing the problem this time...it's the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_RollingWheel_53_Ae]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can't miss 'em. They look like huge wheels with sharp teeth. They roll around and tear up Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So...this is all you, right? I'll go ahead and scratch this operation off my to-do list then....</p>
