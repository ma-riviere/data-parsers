          <p>It's often said that Balaurea reflects how Atreia was before the Cataclysm. The presence of Glowing Spirits seems to prove that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have finished the Magic Cage, but I cannot guarantee it will work. I've never created a cage specifically for Balaurean Spirits before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deliver it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Yilios], so that he can take the next step. Surely even you can handle that simple task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But please tell him that if I could be the first to see a Glowing Spirit, I would greatly appreciate it, considering my role in all this.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not important right now, anyway. What did Lumen say? Did he know of a way to capture Glowing Spirits?</p>

          <p>Ah, a Magic Cage! Of course! I can't believe I didn't think of that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They haven't been used for a long time, you see, since we thought all the spirit types we could capture already had been.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until now, that is! And if you see Lumen before I do, tell him he'll definitely be the first to see my new Glowing Spirit!</p>
