          <p>Regardless of why, the Vasharti Legion took us over from the inside out, starting at the very center. We'll have to retake the base from the other direction.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Can you break through the front guard post and get to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDYun_SZ_2]? Merops is summoning Balaur there. You must defeat them in order to lower the bridge connecting to the innermost parts of the base.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Once through, you will face [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_Nmd_1Named_60_Ah] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_Nmd_2Named_60_Ah]. After that, who can say?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll go on ahead. By the time you catch up, I'll have enough of a handle on the situation to brief you further. Aionspeed.</p>

          <p>That... that was marvelous, [%username]. The Vasharti Legion scatters in ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It shouldn't be long before we drive them completely out of Rentus. I cannot express how grateful I... we are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll open a portal. Please use it and report back to Oreitia. She must know all that has happened here. Siel bless you!</p>

          <p>That took longer than I expected. And you certainly look more... battered than when you left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume this means you fought for Rentus. And fought bravely, from the looks of things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But do you return in triumph or defeat? What did Ariana report?</p>

          <p>Merops? Is there any way she was mistaken? I can't believe he would betray his own people like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are still so many unanswered questions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let that not take away from the magnitude of what you have already done. Thank you, on behalf of Reians everywhere.</p>

          <p>In a seemingly unending series of titanic battles, you slaughtered the Vasharti Legion one by one, including Brigade General Vasharti, and succeeded in recapturing Rentus.</p>
