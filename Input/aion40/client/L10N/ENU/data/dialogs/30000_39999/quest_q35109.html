		<p>What a sun-washed day!</p>

		<p>You must think carefully on this. Perhaps it is wiser to wait until you have twenty-eight or even sixty Tokens before redeeming them for a glorious reward.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>On the other hand, it may be more sensible to claim your shining reward now than commit yourself to a long, arduous journey in hopes of acquiring more.</p>

		<p>Oh, perhaps I should advise you to collect more Tokens. The reward at sixty Tokens is a breathtaking work of divine inspiration, though you'd need to collect twenty-eight again--and then some--in order to achieve it.</p>
