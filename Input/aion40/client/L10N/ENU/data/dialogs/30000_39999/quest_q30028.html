          <p>Daeva, I can restore this Siel's Supreme Bow to its original strength...but it won't be easy. It's very heavily damaged...seen one too many battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a Reian weapon, so only true Reian hands can repair it. Reian hands and Reian materials...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because we share a common enemy, [%username], I will repair this bow for you if you obtain the proper materials.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's an ancient ore that was created when Lady Siel and Tiamat battled one another before the Cataclysm. The energy they produced was magnificent...turned coal into this ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Honeus now has this material. You will need to complete his task before he gives you a Noxallon Ingot. Bring it back to me once he gives it to you.</p>
