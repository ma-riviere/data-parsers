          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_DrakanFi_55_An]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: Escaping from Prison</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: After being taken prisoner and tried for punishable crimes, Blackheart Undarr escaped during an interrogation. To make matters worse, the Hushblade Legion is also pursuing Blackheart Undarr for reasons unclear to us. Last known whereabouts: [%dic:STR_DIC_SEN_LF4_SensoryArea_Q36512].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any Fortuneer who locates and eliminates Blackheart Undarr will be rewarded generously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>Blackheart Undarr should have been pretty weak from the beating he took while escaping the prison, but I hope you didn't underestimate him, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He chose a great place to hide--well, great for him, not for you--in the Primeval Forest. Well, how did you fare?.</p>
