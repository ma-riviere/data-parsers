          <p>Now that I look at it more closely, I think this report may be in some form of Balaur. I know a bit, and it's not exact...but it does have some basic syntactical similarities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're going to need help from a linguist to translate this.</p>

          <p>Ah, a report. Let's see. Hmm...you took this report from the Dragonbound? Well, it's not in standard Balaur. Best guess, it's written in an ancient Balaur dialect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's about all that I can tell you. You should go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nonnos].</p>

          <p>He's not as charming as I am, but he specializes in ancient Balaur history and knows more about Balaur languages than I do. Don't hesitate to come back and see me...for any reason.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Interesting. It has similarities to ancient Balaur...see that symbol there? That's the symbol for Aion. I don't recognize many of these other symbols, but I can give you a loose translation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's addressed to a protector and talks about supplies needed for some type of ritual. Apparently, only half of the supplies are being sent. Oh, and that symbol there, that's Drana. I can't make out much more.</p>
