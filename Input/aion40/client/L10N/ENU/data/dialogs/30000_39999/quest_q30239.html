          <p>Your Noble Siel's Supreme Spellbook has aged much since last we spoke, Daeva. When a Spellbook ages, her vitality and potency are diminished greatly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I can interest you in upgrading to Siel's Dominant Spellbook? I must warn you, though, she's no ordinary book of incantations, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I propose this not for Kinah or gold but for unity against our common enemy, the Balaur.</p>

          <p>I hoped you would agree, Daeva. But you must participate directly and heavily in this process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It shouldn't be that difficult for a [%userclass] like you--you've probably seen and done it all before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, you'll need to obtain a few items and forge the spellbook yourself. Still sound good?</p>

        <body>
          <p>As I said, I will need a few items before we can begin. You'll need to get Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>Your spellbook looks like you've been using it to club Balaur over the head instead of reading it. The fact that you're still alive is a testament to your own skills, not your spellbook.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you upgrade to Siel's Dominant Spellbook, then you could walk confidently into any battlefield knowing you will be victorious. I urge you to think about it.</p>
