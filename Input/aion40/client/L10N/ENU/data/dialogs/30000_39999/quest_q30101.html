          <p>Thank you for coming, [%username]. I have an urgent request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you heard of this...tribe of survivors in Balaurea? The Reian Tribe, they are called.</p>

          <p>As you are probably aware, the Reian Tribe doesn't take too kindly to our kind. They aren't openly hostile, of course, but neither are they openly supportive. We must change this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We and the Reians come from the same stock, and the Balaur are a common enemy to us both. With so much to do in Gelkmaros, improving our ties with the Reians means a great deal.</p>

          <p>I believe the first step we should take is to offer our assistance with their problems. We cannot ask for help until we first offer it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sending more than one person to help would only arouse suspicions, and if I must choose only one, I would rather select the one person who I know can get the job done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No doubt you see what I'm getting at, [%username]. Will you do this for me?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Go to the Marayas Wilds and meet with the Reian known as [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aglauros]. According to Centurion Taustir, he is partial to cooperating with Asmodians if it means defeating the Balaur and their Followers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Help Aglauros with whatever you can, for as long as you can. Earning his trust now will help us in the future--both directly and indirectly.</p>
