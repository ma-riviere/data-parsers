          <p>[%username], have you ever heard of a group of Shulacks called the Nightshade Clan?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't quite call them notorious, but they sure made my list of things to kill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to just consider them annoying, but now I want to consider them extinct.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Especially Shulacks who fancy themselves grave robbers. But they've gone too far this time.... They're expanding their enterprise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They stole supplies from the Inggison Outpost. Our outpost! Blasted furry savages!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Odds are those supplies are long gone by now, but they still need to be punished. And I know how much you like hurting things, [%username]. Any interest?</p>

          <p>Good, good. Show that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCatacombs_Shulack] what they get when they cross the Elyos, will you? And make it hurt!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My scouts reported that they just infiltrated [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDCatacombs], so I'd bet they're going after Balaur Relics now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go in there and show the Nightshade Clan how much fun their throats will have at your knife party!</p>
