          <p>Unfortunately, it's hard to know where to begin. Balaurea is still new territory for us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I think I can at least point you in the right direction for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I may be completely wrong, and your efforts may not bear fruit. But we have to try.</p>

          <p>First, look for the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DF4_DragonTablet_Q30305]s. They were built to commemorate the dark achievements of the Dragon Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you'd rather destroy them, but they might be important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get rubbings of the runes from all the towers, and I'll examine them. Hopefully they'll have information on what exactly is going on at Beshmundir Temple.</p>

          <p>There is one [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DF4_DragonTablet_Q30305] for each of the five Dragon Lords. They are scattered throughout Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only four of the towers have been found to date--we still don't know where Tiamat's is located.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any one of them could contain a clue, so make sure to get rubbings from all four known towers. Be careful--I doubt the Balaur will let you meddle with memorials to their gods.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The more I think about it, the more it disturbs me, partly because we simply know so little about the Balaur.</p>

          <p>But perhaps today will change things. Do you have the rubbings?</p>

          <p>I'm not surprised you're having trouble. The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DF4_DragonTablet_Q30305]s are sacred to the Balaur, so it'd be hard for a Daeva to approach them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you at least located them? Perhaps a different plan of attack is in order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I can't do much more without the rubbings, so please obtain them soon.</p>

          <p>Excellent! Hmmm...yes....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is much interesting material in here. I could write a dozen papers on what you've brought me. Sadly, nothing on Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, it's never mentioned at all. Which is odd, since practically every other temple and shrine in Gelkmaros IS mentioned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mystery deepens. It seems that we need another source of information.</p>
