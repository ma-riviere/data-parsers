          <p>Something unthinkable has happened. A group of Asmodians, presumed to be Shadow Judges, ambushed one of our high-ranking members and seized a list of member names and passwords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even though the roster is protected by a spell, not to mention the language barrier, we are changing our passwords...just in case. The new password is "Cellatu Cellatu in the mountains, Leowasp Leowasp on the plains."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, [%username], member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to go immediately to Soteria Sanctuary in Inggison and deliver the new password to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Atalos], and then to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021] as well. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must preserve our secrecy. For the good of all Elyos!</p>
