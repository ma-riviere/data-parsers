          <p>Aion sunder this! The energy from the Glowing Spirits is like nothing I've ever seen. It'll take me years to analyze it properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There has to be a faster way to capture one. The cu... er, Reian knowledge depends on it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do know someone who may be able to help, however: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lumen], a great Sorcerer who lives right here in Kamar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I keep on my research, perhaps you can ask him if he has any ideas. Be warned: he's a tad... prickly. Don't pay it any mind.</p>

          <p>Hm? What's that you say? Glowing Spirits, alive? You're not just toying with me, are you, [%userrace]? Because if you are....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sulos, eh? Well, he's competent, so I... How to capture one? Hmm. I suppose a Magic Cage will do the trick. But I don't have all I need to make one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be a good Daeva, won't you, and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_LeafyManduriWi_57_An]s on Macori Hill. Bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_30454a] to me, and I'll do the rest.</p>

          <p>Wait here while I fashion the Magic Cage. I would appreciate complete silence. No interruptions!</p>

          <p>Oh, and Sulos sent a message saying you should be rewarded somehow. I don't know if you deserve it, but take it anyway.</p>

          <p>Sulos was frustrated that analyzing the Quartz of Power would take too long, and asked you to find another way to capture Glowing Spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You consulted with Lumen, a Reian High Sorcerer, who offered (somehwat condescendingly) to create a Magic Cage that could work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At his request, you went to Macori Hill and got Noble Fruit for him. According to Lumen when you brought them back, you did... adequately.</p>
