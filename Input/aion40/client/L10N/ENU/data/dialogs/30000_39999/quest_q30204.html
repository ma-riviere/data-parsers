          <p>That's tricky. It's not going to be easy to find information about some arcane ritual performed by a secretive group of Balaur.</p>

          <p>Now, don't despair, comrade. History has many ways of persisting. There's a good chance we'll be able to find accounts of this ritual in some of the older Balaur myths and legends.</p>
