		<p>With 10 Fortuneers Tokens, you may indeed lay claim to a Fortuneers Chest.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If you had 20 or even 40 tokens, an even grander chest would await you. A fortune hunter with more patience would choose to wait...</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But it's up to the individual, I suppose. After all, Fortuneers generally have a strong sense of individuality. If you want this chest here, hand over your Fortuneers Tokens and we'll get things in order.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, seems to be a little problem here. I don't think you counted your Fortuneers Tokens correctly? You don't have as many as you think.</p>
