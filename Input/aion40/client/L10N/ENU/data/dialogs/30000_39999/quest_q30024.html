          <p>I can fix your Siel's Supreme Spellbook, restore its powers...but it won't be easy. It's damaged almost beyond repair, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you look like someone who would appreciate the raw power of what this spellbook can do--I can see in your eyes that you wouldn't misuse it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will help you because we share a common enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend, [%username].</p>

          <p>Because we have seen much war in our lifetime...in our long, long lifetime. We do not seek battle, but we do not cower from it either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This spellbook, in your hands, may save many of my people. This is the only reason I will repair it for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you must find for me a very rare material in order for me to fix it. Only one soul I know possesses this material. Will you bring it to me?</p>

          <p>His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus], and he is an old Reian rich in the wisdom of yesteryear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's an ancient ore that was created when Lady Siel and Tiamat battled one another before the Cataclysm. The energy they produced was magnificent...turned coal into this ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Honeus now has this material--you will need to complete his task before he gives you the Noxallon Ingot. Bring it back to me once he gives it to you.</p>
