          <p>Thanks to you, the Petralith Energy Source is now in our hands, [%username]. But there is much left to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jotun Studio is still fully intact, and the Dragonbound still pursue some scheme. Other Petralith parts remain in the studio--if the Dragonbound can get those parts and use them against us....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must see this through, [%username].</p>

          <p>You must retrieve all remaining [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30009a] from Jotun Studio, so that we may thwart a potential threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If not all, then at least the key pieces of the arms, legs and torso that remain. Chances are the more essential parts of the weapon will be infused with the greatest power.</p>

          <p>As important as these parts are, they won't be simply lying around--if I were a Jotun, I would place the parts in the care of someone I could trust, such as [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_NepilimQ30009A_54_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eliminate them, and bring back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30009a] they carry. Get as many as you can, and I will send them to my colleagues for analysis. The more we can study, the more we can learn.</p>

          <p>Well done, [%username]. We no longer need to worry about Udas Temple or the Dragonbound. With these Petralith parts in our hands, their foul scheme is at an end!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I doubted you at first, but now I see that I made the right decision to collaborate with the Asmodians after all. I think this is the beginning of friendship between our people.</p>
