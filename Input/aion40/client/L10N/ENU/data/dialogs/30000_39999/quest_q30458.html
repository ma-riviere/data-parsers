          <p>I am in love, Daeva! Her name Vanilinerk. She is so beautiful, kind-hearted, soft-spoken, loves Asmodian romance novel like I do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has only one flaw: she is dumb, nyerk! D-U-M-B, dumb! Head emptier than Shulack wallet! Mewrinerk tell her outright he loves her, but she does not understand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Mewrinerk gives Vanilinerk really really nice present, she may understand Mewrinerk's feelings! Heard about special jewel that sounds really pretty!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Ranger_60_Ah] in Argent Manor has [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30408A]. If Daeva could get for Mewrinerk, could make into ring for Vanilinerk!</p>

          <p>Oh, Vanilinerk! Why do you have to be so perfect, but so stupid? Why make innocent Shugos like me fall in love with you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva! Did you get a Golem's Heart? Please say yes! Mewrinerk's heart can't take much more, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Golem's Heart is as pretty as Mewrinerk heard! Vanilinerk cannot miss this sign of his love, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now just have to make into ring and give to Vanilinerk. Then we will be happy together forever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, Daeva. Is much Kinah, but winning heart of beautiful Shugo is priceless!</p>
