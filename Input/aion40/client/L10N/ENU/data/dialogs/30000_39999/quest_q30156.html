          <p>Either way, I have one last request of you, [%username].</p>

          <p>I...I'm afraid there's something I didn't tell you. Sinigalla and I had a relationship once, but we've been drifting apart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want her to think I've been doing this to get her back. I just want her to be happy, with or without me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I were the one to free her, she might jump to conclusions. So could you go in my stead...?</p>

          <p>Yes, I suppose I can't let things go as they stand. It's not fair to either of us.</p>

          <p>Still, it pains me to think of her still petrified until I can get to Silentera Canyon. What if something happens to her before then?</p>

          <p>At her request, you delivered a message to Vili, who was wistful, but glad that his son had found happiness once more.</p>
