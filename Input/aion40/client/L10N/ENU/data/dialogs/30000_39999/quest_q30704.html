          <p>Reian Elder [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Talios] has an urgent request, and asked me to send a Daeva to him.</p>

          <p>I realize everyon is busy with the attack on Tiamat Stronghold, but he needs someone right now. Can you go? You're the only one I can entrust this to.</p>

          <p>Ah, Ancanus must have sent you.</p>
          <p> </p>
	  			<p>Thank you for coming so quickly. We've discovered that the Magic Material Merchants are illegally trading [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30704e]s among themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They claim they acquired them from a Shugo called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4b_10]. I'd like you to find her and learn where she got the fragments from.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Drazma Fragments are extremely dangerous, [%username]. We need to find out how many are already out there!</p>

          <p>Er, well, fine, I sold a few. But did nothing wrong, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Was just selling them for a friend. Shulack named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Shulack_LF4a_8] gave to me, said we would split profit. Good money, nyerk, nyerk.</p>

          <p>So that stupid shugo sold me out, eh? I should have known.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't get me wrong, though, I'm just another middleman, er, middle-shulack here. A Shulack scientist named Hewahewa got the fragments for me. If you don't any more fragments loose, talk to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_ShulackScientist_60_Ae] working at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1]. He's probably so engrossed in his work, he'll never realize you're coming.</p>

          <p>Just in time, [%username]. I was just wrapping up my investigation on the Drazma Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>Fortunately, it appears that very few were actually sold, and I was able to confiscate all of them.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>But more importantly, what happened to the source of the fragments?</p>

          <p>You found out that although Larukin supplied the items, he originally got them from a scientist who found them among the wastes from Professor Hewahewa's lab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you told Tailos, he wondered if it was the same Hewahewa who was behind the Dark Poeta incident.</p>
