          <p>Of course I can repair that Siel's Supreme Staff of yours! I can fix it up so well that it'll bludgeon your enemies like a ballad, make your spells sing with power!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it won't be easy. To restore its powers to full bloom will take quite a bit of work, and some pretty rare materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell you what...if you can get me the material I need, I'll fix up your staff and make it a thing of beauty once more.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to see you're a Daeva who knows a good weapon when he sees one. Most Daevas like the chopping power of a good sword...but you! You appreciate magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll be the strongest staff out there on the battlefield. With a [%userclass] like you wielding it, it'll be glorious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I get to keep what's left of the material after! You get the material, I fix your staff for free, then I keep what's left. We have ourselves a deal, Daeva?</p>

          <p>What I need you to get is very old and quite rare for these parts. Ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's probably a little before your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a unique ore that was birthed when the great Lady Siel fought Tiamat before the Cataclysm. Their energies produced an immense heat that turned coal into this special ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only place to get it out here is from a Daeva named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus]. He fashioned the ore into what he calls Noxallon Ingots. You'll probably have to help him with a task first, but he should give you some in exchange.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>And you're just going to let it fester in ill-repair like that? I've seen a single Sorcerer with one of these incinerate an entire Balaur legion!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you're content keeping all that power bottled up under dirt, dings, and dried blood, are you? Fine!</p>

          <p>But you went sightseeing instead. One more chance, [%username]. Go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] and bring back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]. And remember--they need to be in your CUBE. Can't fix a weapon you're holding, can I?</p>
