          <p>I'm glad you're back, [%username]. I've been going through all my research papers trying to dig up whatever I can on ancient Balaur energy sources.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it seems there was an ancient creature that provided much of their energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You said there were Acheron Drakes in the Forgotten Storeroom, right? Well, according to my notes, it's these drakes that were their energy source.</p>

          <p>The hearts of these Acheron Drakes hold Magical Essence. Actually, almost any big drake in that place may have the essence as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This may be our last attempt, [%username], so let's make it count!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you get the Magical Essence and try activating the Rift Orb once more?</p>

          <p>Then return to the Beshmundir Temple and hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_BonedrakeNmd_55_Ah] in the Forgotten Storeroom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its essence should be particularly powerful. When you get the Magical Essence, combine it with the Quartz Rod to activate the Rift Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDCatacombs_BigOrb_Q30211] should then activate and teleport you to where Stormwing is sealed. If you decide to fight it right then and there--and you don't have to--I don't suggest trying it alone.</p>
