          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We who have ascended by Aion's grace should not forget about our unfortunate brothers and sisters who have not become Daevas of Elysea. Looking out for our brethren, however, doesn't just mean attacking Asmodians or Tiamat. Right now, people in Balaurea are starving--from abandoned Sapiens to the homeless Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Show your grace! Donate food for our suffering brothers and sisters in Balaurea. When you have collected [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35046_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35046_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35046_03], bring your charitable donation to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021]. No matter how small your efforts, they go a long way to help the people of Inggison.</p>
