          <p>I can sympathize with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bhasha] better than most, [%username]. He and I are both prophets, we both spoke against the grain of a tyrant's will, and now we are both imprisoned like rats.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps he and I will be able to reach some agreement that would benefit us both, as well as you. We should initiate contact with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
	  			<p>Let's start with a simple gesture. A prophet's book is his most treasured possession. Return this one to Vhasha, and he will certainly become something more... malleable to our goals.</p>

          <p>You must have killed the Thieves, and recovered my book! And my prophecies all came true?! This is remarkable, as is forming connections with the great Munin!</p>

          <p>Munin realized that Vhasha was in a remarkably similar position as he was, and immediately sympathized with him. He suggested forging a relationship with the imprisoned Balaur prophet, one that could be created with a simple gesture: returning his book of prophecies to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vhasha was thrilled to learn that his prophecies had come true, and was clearly happy to be reunited with his book.</p>
