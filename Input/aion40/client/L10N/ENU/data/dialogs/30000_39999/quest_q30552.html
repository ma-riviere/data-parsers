          <p>Regardless of why, the Vasharti Legion took us over from the inside out, starting at the very center. We'll have to retake the base from the other direction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll break through the front guard post and get to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDYun_SZ_2]. Then, you must defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_Nmd_1Named_60_Ah] in order to reach the former Residential Zone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The deeper you go, the more monsters you'll face. And you may even run into Merops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll go on ahead. By the time you catch up, I'll have enough of a handle on the situation to brief you further.</p>

          <p>That... that was marvelous, [%username]. The Vasharti Legion lies in ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soon enough, we'll drive them out completely! I cannot express how grateful I, and all my people, are.</p>

          <p>Merops? Could she be mistaken? To betray his own people like that!</p>

          <p>There are still so many unanswered questions.</p>
