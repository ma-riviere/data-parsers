          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]! You've arrived at exactly the right time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hler]? She's discovered something in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_UnderPass_Li]. She requested reinforcements, but all my regulars are occupied with the situation here in Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you go? I'm not sure what she's found, but I'm sure you'll have no trouble dealing with the problem, whatever it turns out to be.</p>

          <p>You didn't become a Fatebound Legionary when I wasn't reading the reports, did you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, don't answer that, I know the answer. You have a good reputation though, so perhaps you're the right Daeva for this job anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How much do you know about the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Underpass_SensoryArea_Q30057] inside Silentera Canyon? We haven't been able to figure out what's behind the giant gate there, however, our scouts recently reported a group of Drakan sneaking out of the gate.</p>

        <body>
          <p>We were able to capture and interrogate the group, where they revealed the existence of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDUnderpassRe_SZ]. Brigade General Laksyaka has made this a supply cache for a private army.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe that Laksyaka must have been planning to use the weapons and equipment there in a plot to overthrow Tiamat. He's staffed it with forces loyal only to him, but what they'll do now is anyone's guess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vergelan] inside [%dic:STR_DIC_E_UnderPass_Li] was supposed to come up with a strike plan. Go see him and find out what you can do to assist.</p>

          <p>Richelle sent you to assist with the Hexway situation? Shards! With all the trouble we've been having with the Ellies, I haven't had time for anything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's over-thinking this anyway. Hang on a minute, and I'll explain.</p>

          <p>It's not like there's any rush, is there? The Hexway is just Laksyaka's warehouse, not any kind of real threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send my report to Richelle personally, telling her that I'll deal with the situation once we have the Ellies under control.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do apologize for you having to make this dangerous trip for nothing though.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Richelle then sent you to assist Vergelan. However, Vergelan was busy with other priorities, and said he'd worry about a fight in The Hexway later.</p>
