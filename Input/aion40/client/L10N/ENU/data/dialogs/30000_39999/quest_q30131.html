          <p>[%username]! Is that...is that what I think it is? Is that a Siel's Supreme Mace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Azphel's wings! Legend states that those were the weapons of Lady Siel's Spear Legion, used to combat the Balaur even before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look....</p>

          <p>Hmmmm...this doesn't look good. The weapon has been damaged. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The handle is loose, the shaft is cracked, and...what's this? There are nutshells smashed into the head! Who would use this as a nutcracker?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to wonder about the mace's previous owner. Still, I think it can be repaired. Want some help with that, [%username]? </p>

          <p>Repairing the weapon will require a master's touch, and it just so happens I know some...thing. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a Kobold named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan], and he lives in the Rhonnam Refugee Village. Don't worry, he's on our side...for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One warning: he might be Atreia's finest blacksmith, but he's also Atreia's worst cook. He denies doing that whole "cooking Humans" thing that Kobolds do, but I'd err on the side of caution.</p>

          <p>Not that I doubt your abilities, but repairing that mace would enhance your strength in combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give repairing it some thought, at least.</p>

          <p>Wait moment...by Tataka's spoon! Does Daeva know this is Siel's Supreme Mace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is rare mace, but look damaged. Now Tataka understand why Daeva comes, Daeva wants mace repaired. Tataka will fix, is honor to work on mace like this.</p>
