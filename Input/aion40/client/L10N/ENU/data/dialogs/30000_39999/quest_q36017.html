          <p> </p>
          <p>My fellow Fortuneers, a new bounty in Mitrakand has been decreed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q36017a]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Summary: This gold chest contains countless Balaur treasures along with revelations to some of their most guarded secrets. If it's found, it will be worth a fortune to the right buyer. Rumor has it that it's hidden somewhere in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C2_2], Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first Fortuneer who locates this chest and delivers its treasures to us will be rewarded very generously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>
