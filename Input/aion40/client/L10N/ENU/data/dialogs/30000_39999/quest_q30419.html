        <body>
          <p>I am one of the few who knew about Davlin's project. I am ashamed that I wasn't able to do more to keep the Balaur from her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I begin my penance here and now, by freeing the Elementis Forest from the grip of the Balaur and their cronies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first thing we must do is stop their exploitation of the Luminous Sapling. That means destroying the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Farmer_60_Ah]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may be Davlin's creations, but they are the Balaur's toys now. Terminate them with extreme prejudice.</p>

        <body>
          <p>With the secret of Elementis Forest out, we expect both Elyos and Asmodians to clamor to exploit its resources.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope this does not become another bone of contention between your peoples. There are enough of those as it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that is a matter for another time. I assume the Seed Hetgolems are taken care of?</p>

          <p>Good to hear. That should hamper whatever the Balaur are powering with the Luminous Sapling's sap.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they've already invested so much in the invasion, I doubt they'll let go easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might need to go in again. Until then, take this reward.</p>
