          <p>[%userclass], perhaps you have some idea what this flyer I received is about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It says "The Dark Cloudy Merchants need YOU!" and describes the organization as a Shugo trade group, but... isn't that the Black Cloud Traders?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I can't leave my post, but if you're headed to Sarpan you could ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4a_04] about it.</p>

          <p>Laika asked if you'd ever heard of the Dark Cloudy Merchants, who'd sent her a strange flier. She couldn't tell if they were affiliated with the Black Cloud Traders or not, and suggested you investigate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You met Chicorunerk, who claimed that she'd never heard of the Black Cloud Traders, even though her organization seemed exactly the same, even with a similar name. She invited you to join their organization.</p>
