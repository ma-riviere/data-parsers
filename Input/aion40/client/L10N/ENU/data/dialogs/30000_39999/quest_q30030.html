          <p>[%username], I can restore your Siel's Supreme Dagger to its original strength...but it will be difficult. It's very heavily damaged...seen many battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a weapon built of my people, so only true Reian skill can restore its power. True Reian hands along with true Reian materials...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because our enemy is the same as yours, I will repair this dagger for you if you obtain the materials I need.</p>

          <p>What I need is unknown to your people...and almost forgotten by my own. An ore from a time when we were all still Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only one Reian I know still possesses knowledge of this mineral...and may possibly still have some. You must find him and bring it back for me.</p>

          <p>You must find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] and tell him of the bow you seek to repair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you assist him in a task, he will surely give you the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01] we need. It's an ancient ore that was created when Lady Siel and Tiamat battled one another before the Cataclysm. The energy they produced was magnificent...turned coal into this ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Honeus has Noxallon Ingots. Remember, you must do what he asks, and only then will he give it to you.</p>
