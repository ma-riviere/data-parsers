          <p>We just received some intel, [%username]. It seems that as soon as we start our assault on the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R2], the Tiamat Legion will strike back at our flanks and try to tip us off balance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fear is holding our assault back. We need to send a small team in to take out a specific unit within the Balaur ranks. I'd like you to head up that team.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to take care of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30718a]s. With them gone, our assaulting forces won't have to worry about a counterattack and we should be able to keep up our momentum. What do you say?</p>

          <p>They're getting desperate, you know. In all my days, I've never seen the Balaur acting like this.</p>

          <p>Sorus told you how the Balaur were planning to launch a counterattack immediately after the Elyos assault had started, and asked you to act first and destroy the force the Balaur were planning on sending out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your work was fast and effective, and when you returned, Sorus told you that it was now time to start the main assault!</p>
