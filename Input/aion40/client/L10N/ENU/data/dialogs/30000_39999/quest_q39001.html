          <p>The objectives of our operation here are to rescue the members of the Griffon's Claw Legion, advance to Baltasar Hill, and eliminate the Asmodians stationed there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Griffon's Claw Legion crash landed on Baltasar Hill a while ago, you see. And, while they've been holding up fine for now, the Asmodians have started to gather their forces for an assault. We need you to head out now and attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q39001]s before they can attack our comrades.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So... will you help?</p>

          <p>You did it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Time and again, we show the pathetic Asmodians the power of true Elyos strength, and yet time and again they charge into our gathered spears. I've never seen such boundless stupidity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not to downplay your role, [%username]! I think you'll find this reward most fitting, actually!</p>
