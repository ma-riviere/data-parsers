          <p>I can indeed fix your Siel's Supreme Orb, restore its powers...but it won't be easy. It's damaged almost beyond repair, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you look like someone who would appreciate the raw power of what this orb can do. Many have misused its vigor...become drunk with arrogance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will only help you because we share a common enemy. And the enemy of my enemy...is my friend, [%username].</p>

          <p>We have seen much bloodshed in our lifetime, Daeva. The Reians do not seek battle, but we do not cower from it either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This orb has saved many of my people...and I hope, now that it is in your hands, it will continue to do so.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you must find for me a very rare material in order for me to fix it. Only one Reian I know still possesses this material. Will you bring it to me?</p>

          <p>His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus], and he is rich in the wisdom of forgotten years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's an ancient ore that was created when Lady Siel and Tiamat battled one another before the Cataclysm. The energy they produced was magnificent...turned coal into this ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Honeus now has this metal...you will need to complete his task before he gives you the Noxallon Ingot. Bring it back to me once he gives it to you.</p>

          <p>Your indifference paints a very unflattering portrait of all your people, [%username]. I don't know why I expected anything different.</p>

          <p>If you want your orb restored, you must do as [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] asks of you to receive the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]. And remember--the two components must be in your Cube when you approach me.</p>
