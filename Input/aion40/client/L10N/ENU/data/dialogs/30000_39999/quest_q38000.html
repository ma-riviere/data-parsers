          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I'm glad you found your way here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>News of your exploits has reached all the way to the edges of Elysea--yes, even to Heiron--and it's been said you have the attention of Lord Fasimedes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to talk with you about the opportunities available with the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand. You've heard of us, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With all the terrible enemies surrounding Elysea, the Alabaster Order was established to defend our Aion-blessed people and sun-drenched lands from dark foes.</p>

          <p>Our primary goal is the safety of all Elyos, particularly within our own borders. Secondarily, we seek to thwart those dastardly brutes who threaten safety and wisdom anywhere on Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you could do many great things as a member of the Alabaster Order--from infiltrating enemy bases on undercover missions to transmitting confidential information. Join us in protecting our blessed people!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are free to join or leave, and many of our members have gone on to even greater heights--prepared by their time in our ranks--before returning to the fold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please come and see me after you've had a chance to deliberate. We'll be happy to have you.</p>
