          <p>Long ago, I was entrusted with a special mission that sent me to Beshmundir Temple. I did not want to go alone, so I took my friend Ahbana. We ran into trouble, and....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It shames me to describe my cowardly behavior. I ran away, and my friend was cursed to live as a Specter. He is still there, trapped in Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I dearly wish to rescue him, but I cannot face him. Will you help?</p>
