          <p>[%username], I have a sensitive task for you. As you know, our relationship with the Reians grows stronger every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when I received a request from one of their elders, I thought of you. You are a big reason why our alliance is so solid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One strange thing: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raues] wouldn't tell me what the request is. He only asked for a mighty Daeva who could be discreet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For him to be so circumspect.... I know he must have good reason. Your previous contact with them should assure them of your trustworthiness. Will you take this task?</p>

          <p>You are [%username], are you not?</p>

          <p>I have heard much about you from my fellow elders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping you'd be the one to come.</p>

          <p>Yes, I suppose I have. But I assure you, it was entirely necessary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, not even the other elders know I've sent for you. Most don't even know of what I'm about to disclose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was necessary, in case reckless action risked her life.... But I'm getting ahead of myself. Thank you for coming, [%username].</p>
