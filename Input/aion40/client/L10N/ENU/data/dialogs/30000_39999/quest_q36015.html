          <p> </p>
          <p>Brothers and sisters of the Fortuneers Legion, we hereby decree a new bounty in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q36015a]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Summary: A rare Balaurean root only found in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_A2] of Inggison, it cures everything from lethargic minds to lethargic mating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a difficult quest indeed. Whoever can bring back some of the Wild Phanoe Ginseng will be rewarded quite handsomely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>You new Fortuneers! You have the courage of a Templar but the cunning of a Shugo. Always risking life and limb for adventure. I tried looking for that Wild Phanoe Ginseng some time ago, and I couldn't even find wild dirt! Almost took a long walk in the dark forever, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, how about it, [%username]? Does the blood of a true Fortuneer run through your veins? How did you fare on your search?</p>
