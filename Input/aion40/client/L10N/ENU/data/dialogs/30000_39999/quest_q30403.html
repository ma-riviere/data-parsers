        <body>
          <p>I have a deep, dark secret, [%userrace].  My people think of me as serious, but... I secretly love... cute! There, I said it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_ElementalLightF_60_Ah]s in Elementis Forest are supposedly very powerful and very cute! I want--no, NEED--them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I haven't yet found a way to bond these spirits to me. They're too unique. I'm hoping their energy will help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please help me. Take this Quartz of Power. It absorbs the energy of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_ElementalLightF_60_Ah]s once they've been destroyed. Please? For the cute?</p>

          <p>Hmmm, maybe a little bonnet? Can those spirits wear bonnets? I mean, being made of light and all....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, [%userrace]! You startled me! I was just, uh, theorizing on what sorts of abilities Small Glowing Spirits have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But first, I need to capture one. Did you charge up the Quartz of Power?</p>

          <p>Perfect! Hopefully, with the right ceremonies, this energy will call out to the Small Glowing Spirits, binding them to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine, me being the first to tame an entirely new kind of spirit in ages! I'll be famous!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even better, they're soooooo cute I could... Ahem. Anyway, thanks for your help.</p>

          <p>Sulos was very interested in the Glowing Spirits living in the Elementis Forest, mainly because they were so cute.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hoped capturing their energy in a Quartz of Power would help, so you killed Small Glowing Spirits and brought him their energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was quite grateful for your help, already imagining the power (and cute!) he could wield.</p>
