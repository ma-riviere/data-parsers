          <p>Are you familiar with the Balaur town of Mitrakand, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We recently detected some rather suspicious activity there. The Dragonbound were seen transporting something through the area. We're not sure where to, but we suspect it is the Vorgaltem Battlefield.</p>

          <p>We must find out why the Dragonbound are involved there, and what they're transporting. I have a bad feeling that there will be trouble if we don't follow up on this.</p>

          <p>You should leave immediately if you are to catch these Dragonbound. I recommend searching the area around the Vorgaltem Battlefield for them.</p>
