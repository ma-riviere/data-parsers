          <p>As the Teleporter for Sanctum, I see everyone and hear everything. It's hard to keep news--or secrets--from me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm also good at spreading the news! And I promised Erno I'd help him recruit for the Wrights of Dawn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if you or someone you know is intersted in joining, I'd find Erno, he's in charge of recruiting.</p>

          <p>Glad you asked! The Wrights of Dawn are an organization of premier crafters. You'll find none finer. And they reward their members' skills quite handsomely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have the support of all of Sanctum--even the Seraphim Lords, so I hear. Everyone knows their skill and appreciates their work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interested in crafting? You should definitely go talk with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erenon].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Just listen to what he's got to say, and then you can decide if it's for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And make sure to tell him Polyidus sent you!</p>

          <p>You don't have to decide now. Give it some thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have much knack for it myself, but crafting can be a wonderful endeavor. You save Kinah by making your own items--Kinah that is useful elsewhere. And you earn the recognition and gratitude of all of Sanctum. You also benefit by being a member of a large organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be sure to let me know if you change your mind!</p>

          <p>Ah, you have a spark in your eye! Well met, my friend. Glad you're here. I'll bet you're interested in joining the Wrights of Dawn, no? And why wouldn't you be? Ha ha!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would say Crafters are the very soul of Elysea. Whether in war or peace, we keep the culture of Elyos alive. In utility and in inspiration, we provide the means and the drive for pushing on through adversity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those talented and dedicated enough to labor in workshops for their people are regarded as highly as those on the front lines. We reward skill well.</p>

          <p>We advance the cause for everyone's benefit. We give a place in which talented artisans can hone their skill, ply their trade, live their passion. We reward those of exceptional skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
