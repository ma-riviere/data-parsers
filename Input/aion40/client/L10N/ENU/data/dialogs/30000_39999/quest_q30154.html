          <p>One of my fellow Legionaries was struck with a Drakan curse while fighting in Silentera Canyon. She's been turned into stone!</p>

          <p>I've heard of an alchemist in Morheim who may be able to help, but I can't get time away from here to ask him.</p>

          <p>I'll gather some ingredients, start tinkering with some formulae. It'll take some time, though--please tell Nep to be patient.</p>
