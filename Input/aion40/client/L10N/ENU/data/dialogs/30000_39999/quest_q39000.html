          <p>The Dimensional Vortexes around here have been key strategic points in our fights against the Asmodian threat, but the soldiers have started becoming disenfranchised with the constant combat because they have no idea what they actually DO.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we're having every Daeva learn, and it seems it's your turn. Head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_Arena_L_Lobby] and speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Arena_Rhadaman_E_LHM].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't teach here: too many prying Asmos, apparently.</p>

          <p>Ah, you must be [%username]. [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Arena_Geniki_E_LHM] and I have been waiting for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So. Dimensional Vortexes. Essentially, we've managed to harness the power of rifts, allowing us to invade Asmodae and Balaurea at will. This is obviously an exceptionally powerful tool which we need to keep under wraps for as long as possible. This single device could end our war faster than any weapon, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Arena_Geniki_E_LHM] here will be able to tell you more.</p>

          <p>The Vortex has already been set up and is ready to go, [%username]. We've positioned it to send all who go through to Brusthonin, so I hope you're not freaked out by decay and death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've heard of Adma Stronghold, I assume? Lord Lannok and the diseased lands?</p>

          <p>Wouldn't have been called here if there were any doubts, you know.</p>

          <p>Anyway, let me know when you're ready. This'll be something new for you to try out. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>Crispin asked if you'd heard about Dimensional Vortexes, after which he told you to go see Radaman at the Kaisinel Academy. Radaman told you about the Dimensional Vortex, and introduced you to Giniki of the Sanctum Operations Headquarters. Giniki stated that exceptional Daevas are needed to use the Dimensional Vortex successfully.</p>
