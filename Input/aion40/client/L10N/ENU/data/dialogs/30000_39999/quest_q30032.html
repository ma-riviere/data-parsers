          <p>I can repair this Siel's Supreme Mace of yours...but it won't be easy. It's no standard weapon, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To restore its powers to full bloom will take quite a bit of work, and some rare materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell you what...if you can get me the material I need, I'll fix up your mace and make it as proud as the day it was first forged!</p>

          <p>There's no catch, Daeva. I'll do it for free just to be able to handle that mace again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But like I said, you need to obtain the material first and then I'll fix it...then I'll return it to its original state.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I get to keep what's left of the material after! You get it, I fix your mace for free, and I get rare material to work with. We have ourselves a deal, Daeva?</p>

          <p>The material I need is very rare...and very old. Ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's before your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a special ore that was birthed when the great Lady Siel fought Tiamat before the Cataclysm. Their energies produced an immense heat that turned coal into this special ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only soul around here who has some is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus]. He fashioned them into what he calls Noxallon Ingots. You'll probably have to do a favor for him, but he should give you one in return.</p>

          <p>But you have the Siel's Supreme Mace...one of the most powerful weapons in Reian history!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you're just going to let it languish like that? Do you realize what this weapon is capable of? One of these can wrench the armor off a Balaur general in one swipe.</p>

          <p>But you're content keeping all that power bottled up under dirt, dings, and dried blood, are you? Heresy!</p>

          <p>One more chance, [%username]. Go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] and bring back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]. You'll need to have both items in your Cube when you see me, too.</p>
