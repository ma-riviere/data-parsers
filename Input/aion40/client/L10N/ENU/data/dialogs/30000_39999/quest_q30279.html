          <p> </p>
          <p>You're going to to have a very tough battle here. Yamennes is guarding the Artifact of Protection, and the one thing it doesn't protect is sanity. In fact, it weakens it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the destabilized Aetheric field has made Yamennes stronger, and the Artifact has made him crazy. Good luck. You'll have to touch the Artifact of Protection to make Yamennes appear.</p>
