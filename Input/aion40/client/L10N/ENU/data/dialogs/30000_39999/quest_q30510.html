          <p>I don't blame Tania for what happened. The battle at Rentus was chaotic, to say the least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I've been ordered not to return to Rentus Base until it's cleared, which is why I ask you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun] and find Enetia's ring for me. The thought of the Balaur with it... augh!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the last thing I have to remember her by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of those vile [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_DrakanStrider_60_Ae]s must have her [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30510A].</p>

          <p>I've been thinking about Enetia's final words. I've been wallowing in depression for too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know she'd want me to go on with my life, and I will. It's the least I can do for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But having that ring would help a lot. Did you find it?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'll take her wishes to heart and carry on, in her memory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please tell Tania not to worry anymore. Thank you, Elyos, for helping to heal my heart a little.</p>
