          <p>Ah, [%username]. Have you heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun]? It's a highly guarded, highly secret Reian station that recently fell to Balaur forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its resources and strategic position could turn the tide of war against us, so please, go and work with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Maios], the Reian elder who shared the situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum thinks we may as well cement some sort of alliance with the Reians while chipping at the Balaur. Though I don't expect we'll like them much more.</p>

          <p>I believe I heard your name floating on the wind. You have demonstrated yourself to be more tolerant of my kind than some of your comrades. It is good that you have come.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need someone fully committed. Nothing less will extricate us from this nightmare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reports are sketchy, but all agree that the Vasharti Legion raided Rentus Base. Only a few managed to escape from certain death or imprisonment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Oreitia] is one of these.</p>

          <p>Excuse me for not engaging in further pleasantries, but I have many close comrades still trapped in Rentus.</p>

          <p>If you do not take this situation seriously, you'll have to answer to me.</p>

          <p>I hope so. Besides the personal cost, our chances of defeating Tiamat go down sharply with Rentus in the wrong hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its positioning and resources give the Balaur a perfect avenue to strike at us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll brief you more, but then, you must go to Rentus yourself.</p>

          <p>Ancanus told you that the Rentus Base, a significant Reian post, was in trouble. So you met with Maios, a Reian Elder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maios told you that Rentus had fallen to the Balaur and bade you meet Oreitia, who was very troubled by the situation.</p>
