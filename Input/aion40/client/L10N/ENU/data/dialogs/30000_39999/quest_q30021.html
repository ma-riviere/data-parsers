          <p>Greetings, [%username]! I was just admiring your staff. It's quite impressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That...that isn't a Siel's Supreme Staff, is it? It is! You have to be one skilled [%userclass] to use that thing in battle!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't even want to guess how you came across it. It's rarer than an affordable Soul Healer!</p>

          <p>It's a real shame it's all beaten up...a weapon like that should be housed in a museum, not a battlefield. It's a blasted antique, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Siel's Supreme Staff should have the power to take down just about anything on two feet. But you've beaten that staff so badly...probably couldn't even use it to fish with now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just so happen to know a good Reian that can get that weapon as right as rain for you...on the cheap, too. Doesn't deal with Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors.</p>

          <p>I thought you'd agree, [%username]. After all, a weapon that can't unleash its full power is like giving a Greatsword to a Daeva with one arm! No, no...it's not like that at all, is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary...goes by the name [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios]. He'll take care of your staff for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell him I sent you.</p>

          <p>Are you saying that a staff is just a staff, [%username]? Do you have any idea what that thing in your hand can do? That's the Siel's Supreme Staff you have there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't be so ignorant, Daeva. Advice not followed is a bridge not taken.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know what your staff is now? It's a branch! Just listen to me and get it repaired, will ya?</p>

          <p>Your staff? I didn't think you Elyos used staffs. They're not bloody enough for you, I thought? Let me see what you...is...is this the Siel's Supreme Staff?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did you get this, Elyos? This was the weapon of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! I haven't seen one like this since I was a child!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's seen better days, that much I can see from here. I'm surprised this thing can still fight at all. Well, let me take a look at it....</p>
