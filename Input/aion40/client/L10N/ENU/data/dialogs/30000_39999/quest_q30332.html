          <p>[%username], when I summoned the Fire Spirits, they...spoke to me. I know, flames cannot speak, but I heard their voices in my head. The story they told was a sad one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Long ago, many Fire Spirits were fused into a single form called Flarestorm, in order to fight the Balaur. A veritable conflagration conglomeration! While Flarestorm fought valiantly, the fused spirit was ultimately captured and...I hesitate to speak the words....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Flarestorm was confined to an incinerator in the Beshmundir Temple, and is being used to burn garbage!</p>

          <p>Flarestorm once burned red with rage, but its long period of confinement has corrupted it, and turned it blue with despair.</p>
          <p> </p>        	
          <p>I simply cannot let this ancient spirit be tormented like that! It is time to set aside thoughts of historical immortality--we must simply do what is right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't do much myself, but with your help, perhaps we could free Flarestorm from this horrible fate. Will you help, [%username]?</p>

          <p>The spirits tell me you will find Flarestorm within the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCatacombs_SZ_D2], at a corner of the Garden of the Dead inside the Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have no idea if vanquishing Flarestorm will completely return it to the flow of Aether--since it is composed of many individual spirits, it may require repetition to fully release each spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The spirits I summoned gave me the key to unlock the incinerator, and assuming you will help I will pass it on to you. Please, use it to open the door and purify [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_ElementalFireNmd_55_Ah].</p>

          <p>As I suspected.... It would be ideal if Flarestorm could be released from the incinerator all at once, but it seems we will have to do it one spirit at a time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least one noble Fire Spirit has rejoined the flow of Aether. Given time, they day will surely come when all of Flarestorm has been freed. Please persevere, [%username].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Flarestorm--who is actually a conglomeration of smaller flames--must be vanquished repeatedly to return each individual Fire Spirit to the flow of Aether.</p>

          <p>You went to the Blue Flame Incinerator in the Beshmundir Temple and vanquished Flarestorm, releasing one of the spirits.</p>
