          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Daevas, we have a duty to guide and protect the Humans and Sapiens of Atreia. Countless of these lower beings are losing their homes as the war continues, and they walk the world in hunger. We, the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, are honor-bound to help the unfortunates.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call upon all members to procure food for the poor creatures in Elysea and Balaurea who cannot provide for themselves. [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35040_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35040_02] and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35040_03] are ideal. Please bring your donations to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35014], who will coordinate the distribution of goods on behalf of the Theobomos branch. Even your smallest contribution is of gargantuan help to the needy.</p>
