          <p>One thing about this whole situation disturbs me above all else: the ease with which the Balaur attacked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As much as I hate it, someone within [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun] must have been working with the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll keep an eye on my fellow refugees out here. Would you go and find out what's happening?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Siel willing, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ariana] is still alive to provide the information we need.</p>

          <p>An Asmodian? Where are Oreitia and the others? Are they all right?</p>

          <p>Well, I'm in no position to refuse aid of any kind. Welcome to Rentus Base, [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd ask if you were enjoying your stay, but I think I know the answer already. I certainly know what mine would be.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Warden Merops, head of Rentus Base, was the one who betrayed us to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He opened an Abyss Gate, and the Balaur marched right in. Oh, Siel, why? Why did he do that?!</p>

          <p>Oreitia sent you almost at once to Rentus Base to provide reinforcement and scout out the situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went there and met Ariana, who told you the grim news about how the Balaur managed to take over so easily.</p>
