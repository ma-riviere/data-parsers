          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to the grace of Lord Kaisinel and the efforts of countless Daevas, we have successfully begun to move in Inggison. Our next step is to build an Aetheric Field Observatory there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of our members are already searching for possible sites for the observatory, and we need to gather their reports.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please check in with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Queesia] at the Temple of Scales to get her update, which you should then pass on to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>

          <p>I've been surveying as ordered, but this place isn't the place to build the observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aether generated by the Obelisk is barely enough to support the personnel here, and attacks are much too frequent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell them that, unless we have control over Silentera Canyon, building an Aetheric Field Observatory at the Temple of Scales will not be easy.</p>

          <p>The Alabaster Order are searching for a site to build their Inggison Aetheric Field Observatory. You spoke to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Queesia] for an update on the situation at the Temple of Scales.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She said it wasn't the best place for an Observatory and you reported that back to the head of the Inggison Branch.</p>
