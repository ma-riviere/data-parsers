          <p>All we really know right now is that this passage connected to the Abyssal Splinter was made by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remnants of the Balaur forces that lost the fortress are battling other creatures that protect the area around the entrance of the Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Needless to say, we're having a hard time patrolling the inside.</p>

          <p>No, it's not like the investigators have done nothing. They've gotten inside--they just can't get very far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], what I'm asking you to do is simple: get rid of the biggest problems we have. Maybe then we can proceed further inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Others may not be able to do this, but you can, [%username]. I know it.</p>

          <p>Specifically, Kaluva's Nest has been a problem spot for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There, you'll find a huge Arachna we've named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_Octaside_Kn_55_Al]. She shoots webs all over, and Daevas end up cocooned before they can blink.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get rid of her, and maybe we can find out what's deep inside the Abyssal Splinter.</p>

          <p>I thought you'd make things easy for us, but I guess this isn't the right time for it.</p>

          <p>I guess I'll just keep waiting. Maybe eventually someone will help.</p>
