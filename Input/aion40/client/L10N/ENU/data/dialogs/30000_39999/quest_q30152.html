          <p>Ever heard of the Petraliths, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were an ancient weapon created to combat the Balaur. You might have seen the remains of one at the Grave of Claws in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'll bet you haven't heard that the Petraliths were first assembled at a Jotun Studio here in Gelkmaros. Historians have said that Silentera Canyon is a sunken Jotun Studio, and that's why there are Jotun Relics scattered throughout the canyon.</p>

          <p>I thought so too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've sent Daevas to collect the relics in Silentera in the past, and while some are useful, most are not. However, a number of Daevas I sent also come back empty handed because the Elyos snatch up the relics first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't let those relics fall into Elyos hands, especially if they're related to the Petraliths.</p>

          <p>They're all over Silentera Canyon. The relics themselves shouldn't be hard to find. The trick is identifying relics that are related to the Petraliths, which is my job. </p>
