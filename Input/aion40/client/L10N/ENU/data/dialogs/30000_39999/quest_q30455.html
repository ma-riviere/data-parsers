          <p>A Daeva... here? Aion... has truly sent... a miracle. Elementis Forest... needs you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Forest Protector Jurdin.... He has protected us... and the Luminous Sapling... since time remembered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Drakan... has cursed him. Where once a friend... now a scourge... in terrible agony, haunted by... his own dark shadow--his fear... his guilt... given life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must destroy that shadow... to save Jurdin. Please, Daeva... return our protector... to us. Defeat Jurdin... and lift his curse.</p>
