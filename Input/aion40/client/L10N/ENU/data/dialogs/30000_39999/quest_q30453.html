          <p>Ah, greetings, good [%userrace]. I've heard you've been to Elementis Forest. Oh, yes, I am one of those "in the know," as it were.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was wondering if I could ask for your aid. You see, even though I'm a Sorcerer, I have a certain... interest in Spirits. Why? Ah... That's not important right now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard much about the Glowing Spirits in Elementis Forest. They've been thought extinct since the Cataclysm. Yet there they are, alive! I wish to, ah, study them. Yes, study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to hire you to take this Quartz of Power. Defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_ElementalLightF_60_Ah]s, and their energies will be stored within for me to examine. Interested?</p>

          <p>Oh, I can't wait until I get my hands on Glowing Spirits! How I want to revel in their cu...</p>

          <p>Oh! [%userrace]! I, er, didn't see you there! How much did you hear...? No, no, never mind. It was nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's important is the mission I gave you. Did you succeed in charging the Quartz of Power?</p>

          <p>Good, good! I know it doesn't look much different, but trust me. A sensitive like me can feel the power lurking within.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, these energies will tell me something about how to trap a Glowing Spirit or two.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I realize that you're very busy. Thank you for taking the time to help me.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Small Glowing Spirits in the Elementis Forest and collected their energy in the Quartz of Power so Sulos could study it and figure out how to capture them.</p>
