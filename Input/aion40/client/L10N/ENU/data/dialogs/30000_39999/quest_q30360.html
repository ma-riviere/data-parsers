          <p>The time has come to complete Laize's Breastplate, the hardest part of this whole process of restoring Laize's Panoply.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Breastplate requires the most sophisticated techniques. I doubt anyone else could do it, frankly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only someone as good as me would dare try.</p>

          <p>One cannot be humble when making Laize's Panoply. I have put every millimeter of my soul into this project.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The work has paid off, though. The decorations for the Breastplate are almost ready--all I need now is some strong Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like you to help me as you have before. Will you?</p>

          <p>As you no doubt know, this crystal fragment collects Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Abyssal Splinter and fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Flyingworm_El_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Cyclops_Fi_55_Ah]s. The crystal will fill with Aether automatically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will definitely be worth it, [%username]. Imagine, the complete Panoply!</p>

          <p>Have you heard of the one time Rosarea defied Empyrean Lord Israphel? It was when he suggested peace with the Balaur. She refused to accept his decision, and demanded reconsider.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After Empyrean Lady Siel agreed to try for peace, most Daevas followed the Empyrean Lords, but Rosarea stuck with her belief. She stood in front of the Tower of Eternity with her wings spread and declared she wouldn't move until she was heard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She stood there for days and weeks, right up until the peace ceremony started. And then of course, the Tower shattered, and...well...Rosarea was right in front of it, after all. She never did give in.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But is this enough Aether? There's just no telling until I try, and see what happens to tbe Breastplate.</p>

          <p>If it is, you'll have it at once! Imagine, [%username], the full Panoply yours, with my name on everyone's lips every time they see it...! Here goes nothing...!</p>
