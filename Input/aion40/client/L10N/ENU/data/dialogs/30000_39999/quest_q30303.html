          <p>I suppose we're not going to get any more information out of the report you found. To find out what the Balaur are planning, we need to pay them a visit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Considering where their supplies are transported, I would say that their final destination is likely the Silentera Canyon. And since a ritual is involved, there seems to be only one possibility. The Beshmundir Temple.</p>

          <p>Whatever kind of ceremony they have planned, we need to stop it. Nothing the Balaur are up to can be any good for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you probably know, the Beshmundir Temple is not easy to access. Neither is the Silentera Canyon. It won't be easy, but I need your help [%username].</p>

          <p>With all the secrecy involved here, my guess is that you will need to access the deepest part of the Beshmundir Temple. It won't be easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get rid of any Temple Protectors in your way, and then eliminate whoever is in charge of the ritual. I read a report that someone named [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_DrakanMonkBossNmd_55_Ah] was in the area, but I can't be sure he's involved. We shall see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDCatacombs] is only accessible when the entrance of the Silentera Canyon is open. Watch the corridor carefully so you don't miss your chance.</p>
