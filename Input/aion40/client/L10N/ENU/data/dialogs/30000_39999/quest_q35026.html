          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to the grace of Lord Kaisinel and the efforts of countless Daevas, we have successfully begun to move in Inggison. Our next step is to build an Aetheric Field Observatory there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of our members are already searching for possible sites for the observatory, and we need to gather their reports.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please check in with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Iaetia] at the Inggison Outpost to get an update, which you should then pass on to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>

          <p>Out here in Balaurea, we don't worry about Lepharist Revolutionaries, but there've been Asmodian sightings.</p>

          <p>Yes, it has plenty of Aether, being so close to the Illusion Fortress and an Obelisk...but we're standing in a former Balaur fortress! If we cleaned out all the Drana Energy, then maybe...</p>

          <p>Now, it's time for us to part ways. We don't want to look like we're holding a suspicious conversation.</p>
