          <p>[%username]! Unless I'm mistaken, that is a Siel's Supreme Sword!</p>

          <p>By Azphel's wings, where did you find it? Never mind, please, just let me take a closer look!</p>

          <p>Oh no...that's too bad. This sword seems to have suffered some serious damage, and thus lost much power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The blade is all tarnished, the hilt is bent, and...what's this? Ugh! It smells like it's been inside something's stomach!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you want to repair the sword? Because I know just the...thing to ask.</p>

          <p>Well, I didn't mean that I could repair the sword, [%username]! I don't have the skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I know some...thing that does. He's a Kobold. Don't get me wrong, his blacksmithing skill is unrivaled, but he's still a Kobold. I'm not sure I trust him, especially when it comes to the ingredients that go into his stews....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you're still interested, head to Rhonnam Refugee Village and find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan]. Just be wary if he starts talking about cooking.</p>

          <p>Tataka has seldom seen such thing, just heard about it in legends. Sword was used by Spear Legion, ancestors of Reians.</p>

          <p>Tataka would be honored to repair this sword for Daeva.</p>
