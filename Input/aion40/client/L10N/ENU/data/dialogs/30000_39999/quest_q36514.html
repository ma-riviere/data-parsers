          <p>See, [%username], this is what happens when they send a couple of tea-sipping Aether soldiers out on their own! They get besieged by the Balaur!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They should send us out as security...that'd be a profitable endeavor. Instead, we have to go out after the fact and clean up their mess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh well, Kinah is Kinah. It's the blood that courses through our veins.</p>

          <p>I'm pleased to hear that you took care of Umbatana. Those Balaur Elites are a hardened bunch, aren't they?.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I remember, when I was not much older than you, and I came wing to wing with a faction of Balaur Elites. I still have the scars to remember them by.</p>

          <p>Ahh, don't get me started down memory's path. The bounty for Umbatana goes to you, [%username].</p>
