          <p>Kahrun has much in the way of raw power, but we still don't know if he has enough strength to take on Tiamat.</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	 				<p>If Kahrun were to be killed in that great fight, then the Reians would scatter and the Balaur would come for us. At the same time, if Kahrun kills Tiamat, the Reians would take control of Siel's Relics. We can't let that happen.</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>We must carefully balance our intentions with our safeguards. I want you to gather a significant force, and head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_T1]. Once you're there, take up arms alongside Kahrun, and defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Tiamat_Drakan_Named_60_Al]. Once you've secured victory, you must act fast and claim the relics for all Elysea. Do you understand?</p>

          <p>Lord Kaisinel is here?! We thought that his participation was forbidden!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lord of Illusion has fooled me, and in the midst of this masquerade is a clear attempt to retrieve Siel's Relics.</p>

          <p>Your eyes show as much surprise as my heart feels, but yours is not the highest link in the Elyos chain, friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat's death is a momentous occasion, but disappointment sits heavy within me. Treachery and betrayal weigh down on a soul, and Kaisinel's actions here are significant to say the least. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He could have saved so many lives had he acted sooner! But he only wanted the Relics, and waited until now to take them... while our soldiers died in the thousands. Even then, Israphel was still able to sneak in under our noses and take them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must return to Kamar and report Tiamat's death. We will celebrate, but tomorrow the mists of fear will descend again.</p>

          <p>Gift indeed. Not many have risen to your rank, [%username], and none have risen at your speed. You are a gift for all Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot trust many, but I will choose to trust you; I cannot show myself often, and so I will choose to use you as my medium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My scouts have already started tracking [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel]. Once their work is done, they will tell you of his whereabouts. You will then retrieve the relics. While they toil, you must go to Commander [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ancanus] and tell him of Tiamat's demise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go, gift. Cogs are turning, and yours is required soon: rest while you can.</p>

          <p>Tiamat's death is cause for absolute celebration, but if Israphel has the relics... there will be a whole new challenge before long.</p>
          <p> </p>
           <p>I will deliver the news to Sanctum myself. Preparations must be made, my friend. Thank you for everything you've done, but it seems as though we cannot rest yet.</p>

          <p>Ancanus was worried that Kahrun might steal Siel's Relics if he killed Tiamat alone, and ordered you to fight alongside the Reians during the great battle. However, as you fought, Lord Kaisinel himself appeared and subdued Tiamat, allowing you to kill her once and for all.</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>Unfortunately, just as Tiamat drew her last breath, Israphel appeared and stole Siel's Relics for himself before disappearing. Kaisinel was enraged, and ordered you to return to Ancanus while his spies tracked the coward Israphel.</p>
