          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: Contamination of Taloc's Forest</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: Celodos Twistrings, a rogue Reian ghost, has been tainted by forces unfamiliar to our legendkeeper. His mere presence spreads this contamination deeper into the forest. Immediate eradication is requested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last known whereabouts: Taloc's Forest. Lure in Celodos Twistrings by using the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LF4_FOBJ_Q36505] already set up there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyone who assassinates or apprehends Celodos Twistrings will be generously rewarded.</p>
          <p> </p>
