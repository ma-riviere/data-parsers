          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I was just admiring your weapon there...is that a Siel's Supreme Polearm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have to be one tough [%userclass] to carry that thing! If that is one, I don't even want to speculate on how you got it. Rarer than Loktania in a good mood!</p>

          <p>It's a real shame it's all torn up--a weapon like that should be kept in pristine condition. It's a damn antique...have to put some real love into it, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A true Siel's Supreme Polearm has the power to take down any enemy before it. That old beaten thing you have there...it probably couldn't even chop wood for a fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just so happen to know a good Reian that can get that weapon as right as rain for you...on the cheap, too. Doesn't deal with Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors.</p>

          <p>I'm glad you agree, [%username]. After all, a weapon that can't unleash its full potential is as useless as a pretty smile on an ugly Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I said, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary...goes by the name [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios]...or something to that effect. You know how confusing those Reian names are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, head out there and he should be able to help you out. Tell him I sent you....</p>

          <p>Your polearm...? I didn't think you Elyos still used polearms. Let me see what you...is...is that Siel's Supreme Polearm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did you get this, Elyos? This was the weapon of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! I haven't seen one like this since I was a child!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's seen better battles, though. I'm surprised this thing can still fight at all. Well, we can fix that, right?</p>
