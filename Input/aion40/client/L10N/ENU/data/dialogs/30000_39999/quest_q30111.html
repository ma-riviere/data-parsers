          <p>I have to admit, [%username].... This poison is completely stumping me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like nothing I've ever seen--too potent to be plant-based, too viscous to be animal-based, too pure to be artificial.</p>

          <p>The only possibility left is that it was created with something native only to Gelkmaros.... Maybe even exclusive to Udas Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means we'll need to go to the source. It's the only way to find out enough about it for an antidote.</p>

          <p>My analysis indicates the poison is most similar to insect venom. Still nothing like it in Asmodae, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_SensoryArea_Q30011] must be in Udas. It's the only way they could use so much without obvious transport.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you find it, destroy it. I'll send other Daevas to bring back samples from whatever remains.</p>
