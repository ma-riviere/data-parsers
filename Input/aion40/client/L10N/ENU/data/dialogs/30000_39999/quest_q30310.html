          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, I can use Tikel fiber to strengthen the paper weave.... A little cleanser will remove some of the yellowing....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the ink.... Hmmm, that might be difficult.</p>

          <p>I have a special treatment liquid that can darken faded ink. Well, I did, before I used the last of it yesterday on an important library book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Trouble is, my next shipment isn't due for another few days. Fortunately, it's fairly easy to make. The key ingredient is animal bile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this document is that important, the quickest way to go about this is for you to get the bile for me. How about it?</p>

          <p>Since the ink was made in Gelkmaros, the most effective treatment will probably be derived from that region as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest hunting [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DragonFly_54_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Varanus_DR_54_An]s at Vorgaltem Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can purify their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30310b] and use it on the faded lettering.</p>

          <p>Good timing. I did all the other work while you were gone. Now the paper won't disintegrate from the slightest breeze.</p>

          <p>I know there isn't that much ink to restore, but I'll need more [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30310b] than that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to boil it down before I use it, or it'll eat right through the paper.</p>

          <p>Perfect! Now I boil it down and mix this in.... There! Now to apply it....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good, I can already see improvement. It'll take a while to dry, but the lettering should be sharp and clear by the time you get back to Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for bringing that in. I like keeping busy.</p>
