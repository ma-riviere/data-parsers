          <p>I've been having these...dreams lately. Horrible dreams! They seem to get worse each night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In these dreams, I can see the tortured souls of Daevas...hear their screams. I can see everything so vividly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not like regular dreams, though. They're like visions...like I'm seeing a projection of something actually taking place.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure. Everything grows hazy once I wake up, but I know something is wrong! I need to somehow see my dreams when awake, know what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help me, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30226a]s, in sufficient numbers, allow you to see your dreams from the previous night while awake. Would you locate them for me?</p>

          <p>In Hanarkand, there are creatures called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_FlyingFoam_55_An]s. The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30226a]s are made from their bodies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With their power, I'll be able to review my dream and find out where these tortured Daevas are being held.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know this sounds crazy, [%username], and maybe I'm wrong...maybe it is just a bad dream. But I need to be sure. Thank you for helping.</p>
