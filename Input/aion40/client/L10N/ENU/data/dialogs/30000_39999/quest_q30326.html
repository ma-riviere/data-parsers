          <p>My heart is filled with sadness of late. Strange dreams plague me, growing worse with each night...dreams of tormented Daevic souls, screaming...crying for release.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought they were just nightmares at first, but I am now convinced otherwise. These are most certainly visions of something taking place right now.</p>

          <p>I suppose the only way would be to visit the place and see for myself, but the scene is never clear enough to know where it might be taking place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, a substance known as [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30326a] makes it possible to recollect visions from a dream even after waking. With the clarity of consciousness, I could certainly locate this dream spot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's my duty as a Priest to rescue these souls. Will you help me, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Thank you. With the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30326a], I will be able to find out where the souls of the Daeva are trapped and--more importantly--how to free them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are not many natural sources of Dream Powder, but one such source is at the Dragonrest. Go there and hunt down the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_ShadowStalker_Sand_54_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_ShadowStalker_Sand_55_An]s that shed it.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I...I understand. You must be skeptical about this dream being a true vision.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But whether you believe me or not, I know my dreams are visions of something real. What sort of a Priest would I be if I couldn't make that distinction?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have faith, [%username]. Search your soul for your own font of faith, and if you find it return to me.</p>
