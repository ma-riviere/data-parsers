          <p>In a time so long ago that I can no longer remember when it was, I served under a great captain. A brave and wise soldier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But a cruel twist of fate led this captain to fall under a Balaur curse, subjecting him to a spirit life of servitude under those wicked villains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hero of Siel, will you free him from his cruel fate?</p>
