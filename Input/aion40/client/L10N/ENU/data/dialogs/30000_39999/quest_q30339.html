          <p>Was it heavenly scent that lured Daeva back here?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? Daeva wants to improve Noble Siel's Supreme Spellbook? Well...Tataka might be able to enhance spellbook....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But is Daeva sure does not want to try Kobold bulgogi? Is delicious even if meat is little rare, and fruit was little rotten, and little ash from fire got on...Kobold promise!</p>

          <p>Very well, but Daeva is missing out on tasties!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmmm...to improve spellbook, Tataka will need three rare materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is Daeva committed to finding them? Will not be easy.</p>

          <p>Tataka needs [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] to improve spellbook.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmmm...Tataka thinks he heard that Sealed Balaur in Beshmundir Temple has Vorpal Essence. Shulack captured by Nightshade Clan has Special Shulack Refiner. Blessed Aurium Ingot is special mineral used by Shulacks, very valuable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once Daeva has all three materials, take to Debilkarim's Forge and fuse together to make Essence of Siel. Then bring back to Tataka with spellbook.</p>

          <p>Since Daeva is doing nothing...perhaps would like to be first to sample Shulack meatloaf? Is new Tataka creation, does not contain Human or Balaur! </p>
