          <p> </p>
          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Wanted: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_ShulackWi_52_An]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: Theft of Aether, Attempted Murder</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: As reported by witnesses on the third day of seven, Firuki Lightfingers was seen stealing Aether from Obelisks. This act threatens our military operations and puts Elyos soldiers in peril's way. Last known whereabouts: Rokoros Village, though the creature is known for using Windstreams.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A fair reward will be paid for the apprehension or assassination of Lightfingers and the return of the stolen Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>I have a source, a Shulack turncoat, who tells me that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_ShulackWi_52_An] is still hiding out in Rokoros Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I've learned one thing in my many years as a fortune hunter, it's that a fugitive always returns to a familiar place. So get back out there and wait. You'll find him...or he'll find you.</p>
