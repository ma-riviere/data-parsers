          <p>They were all men once like I, men with hopes and dreams for the future. That future was cruelly taken from them by the Krall, and now they are bound here in eternal servitude.</p>

          <p>It is not the end they deserve. Were it in my power I would grant them rest, but they no longer listen to my commands.</p>

          <p>I am afraid the only peace they can know is the flow of Aether. You would be doing a great kindness by returning them to it.</p>
