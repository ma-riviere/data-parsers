          <p>Moorinerk understands deceiving others to get ahead, but these Steel Rake Pirates go too far!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is not that they are impersonating Black Cloud Traders to steal valuables and make raids.... It is that they succeed when they are so bad at it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at me. Look at me! I am real Shugo! Look nothing like Shulack! Nothing! How can anyone be fooled?</p>

          <p>Daeva understands! Moorinerk is very offended! This is personal now; the Steel Rakes must not get away with this!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, if Steel Rake Pirates keep pretending to be Black Cloud Traders, I will be soon out of job!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps Daeva can help innocent Shugo merchants and teach Steel Rake Pirates a lesson so they will stop pretending to be us?</p>

          <p>Suggest targeting leader of Steel Rake Pirates, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDShip_ShulackCaptainNmd_46_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is vicious and ruthless. Other pirates hang on his every word, nyerk. They live in fear of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, if he is defeated, other pirates will scatter or rebel. That will teach them that real Shugos must not be crossed!</p>

          <p>Oh, my, did I drop large bag? Bag filled with much much Kinah that is just lying around waiting for Daeva to take?</p>

          <p>Well, maybe if Daeva did favor for Moorinerk, Daeva would feel all right with taking big bag stuffed full of Kinah.</p>

          <p>Wonder where bag is? Seem to have lost track of it. Maybe it will lie right there until Daeva changes mind about taking job....</p>

          <p>Good! Steel Rakes will probably go on raiding, but maybe they will stop silly "pretending to be Shugo" ruse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or maybe Moorinerk will just try to educate everyone that I am Shugo and they are Shulacks! It is not that hard! Arrrrgh!</p>

          <p>Moorinerk was frustrated at the Steel Rake Pirates impersonating the Black Cloud Traders, for several reasons. He asked you to beat a little sense into their Captain, Brass-Eye Grogget.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you snuck onto the Steel Rake and commenced with the sense-beating. You returned to a reward from Moorinerk, who was still frustrated that anyone could mistake Shulacks for Shugos.</p>
