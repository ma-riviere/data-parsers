          <p>Do you know how much a Guardian's monthly salary is? It's barely enough to live on, and you'll never be able to save anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can't live your whole life as a Guardian. You need to save money if you want to live comfortably after retirement, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My friends don't think ahead. They just get poetic about a Daeva's calling or a Guardian's duty. They're not seeing the Big Picture!</p>

          <p>Here's a tip from me to you, [%username]. Just keep quiet about it. I've got a system that lets me earn extra money while still doing my duty as a Guardian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all about the skins and shells. Whenever we have to hunt wild animals to clear the perimeter, I keep that stuff and sell it to the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're supposed to dispose of it, but that's like throwing away money! So instead I give it to my Shugo friend and he pays me. By the time I get out of this place I'll have a tidy sum put away!</p>
