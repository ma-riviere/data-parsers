          <p>In times of trouble Humans pull together, united in their efforts to save their villages. I suppose we could rely on the Guardians dispatched from the fortress, but they are overwhelmed by other duties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the villagers should look out for themselves. That's why I'm part of the Watch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But sometimes I get frustrated.</p>

          <p>Well...it's Berenike.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We just heard about the leader's death, so Priest Aerope asked her to keep the Watch organized until we could pick a new leader. But she's already bragging about being acting Watch leader.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think she should spend more time practicing her swordsmanship instead of bragging. Someone needs to take her down a notch. She's getting too big for her britches.</p>
