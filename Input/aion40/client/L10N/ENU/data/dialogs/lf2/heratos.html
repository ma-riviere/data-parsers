          <p>My first mission as a Daeva of Life was to manage the Mystic Springs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is my fault that they are drying up. I am their steward, and I am responsible for protecting them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Somehow, I shall find a way to restore them. It is my duty.</p>
