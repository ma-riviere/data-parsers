          <p>Eltnen is so uninteresting. When I get to Sanctum, I'll have endless fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My father ascended and I just know I will too. I mean, just look at me! It'll be wonderful to be this young and beautiful forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I become a Daeva, I'll never let myself end up somewhere boring and remote like Eltnen. Yuck! There's just too much fun to have in Sanctum, though I might come back just to laugh at Adelphie!</p>
