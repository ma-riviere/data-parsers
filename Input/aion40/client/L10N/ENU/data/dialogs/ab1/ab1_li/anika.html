          <p>Amos. See him over there, patrolling so valiantly? Don't you think he looks handsome?</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I requested this post so I could get closer to him, but he's hardly spoken to me. He's quite brusque, and doesn't show his feelings at all.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you just wait and see. I'll do whatever it takes to make Amos my man.</p>
