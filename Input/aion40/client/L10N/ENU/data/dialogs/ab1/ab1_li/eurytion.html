          <p>You've seen some action, haven't you? You have that look about you. Of course the war is taking its toll on us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait a minute! Are you still fighting with that old thing?</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm impressed. Of course, even a mediocre weapon can be deadly in the right hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No offense, but I'd think about replacing it if I were you. A time will come when a weapon like yours just won't do, no matter how good with it you may be.</p>
