          <p>This squad is filled with the roughest, toughest Legionaries in all the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're an ornery, opinionated, and stubborn bunch. You'd think there'd be constant in-fighting, yet they carry out missions like an elegant machine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all due to Centurion Radgrid. She may wear a smile on her face and speak quietly, but none who know her would dare to go against her--she's one of the toughest Daevas I've met!</p>
