          <p>I'm concerned about Gefjun. She hasn't been eating or sleeping well lately.</p>

          <p>She lost her daughter to the Balaur, and thinks of nothing but planning her revenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It isn't like her daughter will come back, no matter how many she killed. That's no way to live.</p>
