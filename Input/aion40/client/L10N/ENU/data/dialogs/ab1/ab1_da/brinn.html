          <p>Greetings, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Haven't we met somewhere before? Did you fight the Balaur at Sulfur Fortress or Siel's Western Fortress?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? Perhaps I've confused you with someone else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so ready for this waiting to end. I'd like to leave for battle now. I can't wait to beat whatever enemy comes along to a bloody pulp.</p>
