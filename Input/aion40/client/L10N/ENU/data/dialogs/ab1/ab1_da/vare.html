          <p>Just standing here all day, I have a lot of time to think, and I've come up with some good ideas for improving the morale of Archons stationed in the Abyss--exhausted Archons don't win battles, you know.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Creating a ration plan that provides different food every meal and issuing sleeping bags that are warm and comfortable would be a start.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might also be nice to have entertainment from Pandaemonium now and then. Like that handsome bard, Araison. I know my morale would be improved if I could meet him...if you know what I mean.</p>
