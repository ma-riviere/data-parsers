          <p>They say that the word of a commander is law on the battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That implies a lot of trust. Every now and then, I see a commander make a choice that doesn't make sense and wonder...how many have died needlessly because of a bad call?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ever become a commander, remember you have responsibility for all the lives of your subordinates.</p>
