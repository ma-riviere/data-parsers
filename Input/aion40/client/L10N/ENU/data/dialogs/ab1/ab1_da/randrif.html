          <p>The importance of a fortress was only obvious to me after we lost one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even now, Asmodian control of the Wings of Siel Archipelago is weakening and our control over Reshanta itself is deteriorating...</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why Aslak insists that we bear the responsibility for losing the fortress. We must put this right. We must aid the Centurion in retaking the fortress, but to do that we need help from many Daevas.</p>
