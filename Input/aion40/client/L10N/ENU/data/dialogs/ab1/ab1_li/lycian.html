          <p>Yes, it is you. When I first saw you in the distance, I wasn't sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Um... Will you step aside from that spot please? You're standing on a very important fossil. That's it, thanks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, where is my pen? It was in my hand just a minute ago.  Have you seen it by any chance?</p>

          <p>I don't envy you, you know. I see you all fighting and chasing glory...but this fossil, right here--it's the real truth. Centuries from now, our people may remember our battles, but our remains will be rocks beneath their feet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can learn from this work. Who knows? Maybe we'll discover something that can change the course of the fight.</p>
