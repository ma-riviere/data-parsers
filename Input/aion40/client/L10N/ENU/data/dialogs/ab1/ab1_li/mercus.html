          <p>The undead in this area were the residents of the city that existed here in ancient days. Do you know of the Ruins of Roah?</p>

          <p>This is all that's left of the city of Roah, which existed long ago. It is said to have been a very prosperous city, but it fell to ruins due to the arrogance of its people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I see the Elyos and Asmodians wielding such powerful forces, I can't help but wonder if we could learn something from the fate of these people and their city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a pity that so few are concerned about it. We should remember the fall of Roah.</p>
