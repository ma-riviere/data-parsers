          <p>I heard a lot of things about the Protector of Primum Legion before I joined it. People said that the Legionaries were all capable, but as a group they were very uptight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I got here, I realized how bad it was. I don't know how every one of them can be so boring in every way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I admit they can fight, but they don't have a snippet of humor or excitement among them.</p>
