          <p>Oh, so you're [%username]! I heard that you used to be a bandit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must have gotten around a bit before you ascended. I'll bet you're more battle seasoned than other Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You probably traveled...met interesting people...perhaps you heard stories of strange things like other Empyrean Lords or a new world.</p>

          <p>Well now you're a Daeva, you'll travel to more places and meet more people than ever before.</p>

          <p>And if you hear an interesting story, please visit me and tell me about it. I love weird and fantastic stories!</p>
