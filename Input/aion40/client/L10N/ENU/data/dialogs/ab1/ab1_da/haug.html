          <p>You haven't seen Protector Hlin, have you? I hear she's been poking about doing research for Grunn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd give my wings to know what they're doing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do know he's researching Aether. As long as he's not presuming to study time and space as well, I'll leave him be. But his research directly affects mine. After all, Aether can be used to stop time. It aids in teleportation. These are MY specialties.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Consider the power: Aether was used to stop the fall of the Beluslan Fortress in the midst if its collapse! That's the kind of power I want.</p>
