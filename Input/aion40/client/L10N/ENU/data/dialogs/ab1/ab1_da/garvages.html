          <p>It's not a popular thing to say, but I think Pandaemonium is sending Daevas to the Abyss before they're ready.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Troops are arriving here, after having fought only a few battles. That's simply not enough experience for the kinds of missions we have here.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I wasn't talking about you, [%username]--but honestly, how many Daevas do you think can carry out their missions properly as soon as they arrive here?</p>
