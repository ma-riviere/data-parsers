          <p>I don't why, but I have been having weird dreams lately. Maybe I'm just tired or maybe it's stress from battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, what's more strange than the dream itself is that I dream the same dream every night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I dreamed it before ascending as a Daeva but I started having the same dream again recently. I don't have a clue why I keep having this dream....</p>

          <p>I'm flying over a green grassland, and my wings are green. And the wings aren't mine, but more like the wings of a Sylphen.</p>

          <P>At least it isn't a nightmare, but I don't know why I am dreaming this every night.</P>
