          <p>So much work to do here...and I feel so guilty about working here in the fortress while others face hardships on the front lines. Nothing I do here is as difficult as facing the constant threat of the Balaur or the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm here because I train recruits but I also know what dangers I send them to face. I should be out there, fighting the enemy side by side with my Archons!</p>
