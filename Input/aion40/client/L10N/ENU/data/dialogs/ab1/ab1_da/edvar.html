          <p>Oh, apologies Daeva--I didn't mean to be sharp. I'm working on a poem, and I try not to let the other Protectors know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I scribble down notes whenever I have some time on duty, but if I don't like them I tear them up. There are a few I saved, though...I think they're good. Would you like to hear one?</p>

          <p>Roast Pujery with Salt, laid out on the table.</p>
          <p>You are rather salty, sprinkled with too much salt.</p>
          <p>Suddenly our eyes meet, and I flinch.</p>
          <p>Please forgive me, Pujery.</p>
