          <p>Your clothes are battle-worn but you don't look tired. You look...peaceful, like nothing bothers you. You haven't lost anything--or anyone--in this blasted war, have you?</p>

          <p>My mother and older brother were both Daevas. During the early days after Reshanta's discovery, they Vanished.</p>

          <p>All I have left is this sun-cursed war.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes, it's all for the glory of Azphel and Pandaemonium. But when it ends, if it ever ends, I'll have no home, no people to celebrate my return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My best hope is to fight to honor my family and the great deeds they did.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, I suppose, to find those who Vanished them. To make them pay.</p>

          <p>That's a purpose worth fighting for.</p>
