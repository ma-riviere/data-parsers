          <p>I never imagined that our forces had lost Siel's Eastern Fortress. I was extremely disappointed when I learned of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Centurion Amundi gave me courage. He told me if we never stop attacking the fortress, we will eventually be able to take it back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And he's right. I can't just wallow in despair when we're surrounded by enemies. We must deepen our resolve to confront the enemy and retake the fortress!</p>
