          <p>What do you think is the most important attribute in a hunter? Actually, this question isn't just for hunters. It's a question for all who have to fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The answer, of course, is courage. The presence of mind and to react properly in any situation. If you have courage, you can survive with just your bare hands.</p>

          <p>What helped me build courage were Ruby Keraton.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even before I ascended, I hunted them. Sometimes they'd turn on me at the last moment of the hunt, and fear would rise up so strongly that it threatened to paralyze me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The very size of those beasts! But each time I overcame that fear, my courage grew. [%username], are you ready to hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CatosD_26_An] as I did?</p>
