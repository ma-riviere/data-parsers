          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! You're doing well for yourself, I see. A successful veteran of the wars and all that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there's more to a Daeva's life than endless fighting, isn't there? Every Daeva's got to have something that keeps them going, a passion. Eternal life is...well...an awfully long time. Heh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what about you, [%username]? What gives your life meaning?</p>

          <p>He seemed deep for someone who looked so ordinary. If anyone could help you find some meaning, it'd be him.</p>

          <p>He's the Aetheric Field Protector of Eltnen, name of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aeolus]. You should go talk to him.</p>

          <p>The meaning of life? That's a weighty question, [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate to disappoint you, but even I haven't solved that great riddle yet. Aether flows around us, the very source of life itself, and yet life's meaning escapes me even as I ponder it in bed during the hot Eltnen night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder why I serve Atreia, why I don't take to the skies to explore the world, living only for myself.</p>

          <p>That's the question I ask myself every morning. My duty keeps me tethered to my identity. Without it, I'd be lost and so here I stay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've not really answered your question. Perhaps you should get a different point of view.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For instance, the Shugos. They live brief lives, always searching for profit. But they seem more content than any Daeva I've ever known. There's one Shugo, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_c10], in Sanctum. He's better-spoken than most Shugos. Perhaps you should get his perspective.</p>

          <p>The closest I ever got to my answer was talking with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fermina]. She's lived since the Empyrean Lords first ascended. She'll have a better answer for you than anyone, except maybe the Empyrean Lords themselves. But she's a little eccentric....</p>
