          <p>Bah! These field reports are nearly worthless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask for information about the Nute Warrens or the Lepharist Research Center, I get crazy stories about phantom ships near Jeiaparan Village or some person named Berone who vanishes in mid-air.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's another one! A Shugo with a strange accent traveling around Heiron. Strange accent? I can barely understand any of them anyway with their nyerk nyerking!</p>

          <p>Okay, check this one--a Shugo calling himself Roikinerk has been seen around the Lepharist Research Center, the Decayed Grove, and Puitonen Bogs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's a Shugo doing there? Making Kinah, I suppose. Blasted Shugos will trade with anyone--even Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd better check this out. [%username], do you think you can find this Roikinerk?</p>
