          <p>Camana, from Jeiaparan Village, endured a long and hard journey to deliver a message to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As she passed through the Decayed Grove, she was attacked by Elim that turned into [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Agrint_34_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't believe her, but she swears it's been like that for some time now.</p>

          <p>I don't know the exact cause, but it's possible a contaminant of some sort is involved. I hate to ask but could you go to the Decayed Grove, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must know if all the Elim have been turned into [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Agrint_34_An]s.</p>

          <p>If they have all become Agrints, I must ask a dark favor of you. Eradicate them all, for everyone's sake.</p>

          <p>Perhaps only one or two Elim actually turned into Agrints. We'll just hope for the best.</p>
