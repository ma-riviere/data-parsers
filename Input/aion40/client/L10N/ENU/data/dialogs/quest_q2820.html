          <p>Thank the shadows you're here, [%username]. Listen, we're in deep trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our medicine stocks are critically low. I requested resupply from Primum Landing, but who knows when it'll arrive? Some of our wounded can't wait.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Azphel teaches us to fend for ourselves whenever possible. So I'm looking at Lake Asteria, of course...</p>

          <p>Not in the lake, exactly. The horns of young Tricos near the lake. An intact horn is full of divine energy that speeds the healing process. Grind them up and you've got a powerful sedative, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a manpower problem, though. All my soldiers are either wounded or guarding our walls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus I turn to you, [%username]. Only you can get medicine in time to succor our wounded comrades.</p>

          <p>Many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_Trico_31_An]s wander Clocktower Plain, in front of the fortress. Should be obvious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The more horns you bring, the better. It'll take at least five horns to make medicine for everyone, though.</p>

          <p>Oh, and you must bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2820a]s. Broken or flawed ones are useless. The aether leaks out before we can grind them up.</p>
