          <p>As everyone can see, Eltnen is dying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The little Aether we have is depleting rapidly, and it seems that even Lady Yustiel is having trouble countering it.</p>

          <p>Lady Yustiel and many Daevas of Life are trying to revive Eltnen. There are many efforts to stop the depletion of the Aether and the erosion of the soil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are trying hard not to lose so much as a blade of grass, because the trees and grasses are all that prevent the soil from becoming sand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now a recent problem has occurred in the Manduri Forest.</p>

          <p>Yes, your help in Eltnen has been exceptional and made me hope for another favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wiki and Ulmus are the important plants in the Manduri Forest preventing the soil from eroding. But now Monitors and Vespines are crowding into the Manduri Forest, destroying them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is that they move in groups, and are quite fierce. It would take a Daeva to hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Varanus_22_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Vespa_22_n]s.</p>

          <p>You can find far too many Monitors and Vespines throughout the Manduri Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even though it is cruel to kill an animal, I'm not asking you to slay them all. We must do it for the good of Eltnen. If the region becomes a desert, the Monitors and Vespines would be extinct soon after.</p>
