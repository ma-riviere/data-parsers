          <p>The winds are changing for the poor Elim. Those shadow-cursed Agrints have moved into the Decayed Grove, tearing everything up in their wake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those poor, peaceful Elim are reaping the worst of it, though. Their natural habitat is being taken over by that intruding filth.</p>

          <p>Lady of Light, [%username]! The gods? Do not speak to me of the gods! They've forgotten what it means to be a god. To let this innocent blood spill right below their own noses...</p>
