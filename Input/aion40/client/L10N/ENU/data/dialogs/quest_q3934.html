          <p>Excellent combat skills? A cool demeanor in a crisis? Brilliant tactics? </p>

          <p>Yes, all are essential. But fighting without a clear sense of the battlefield is like fighting in the dark.</p>

          <p>Exactly. Everyone thinks we spend most of our time here in Sanctum, but threats to Elysea usually emerge from remote areas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why we have informants everywhere. If something happens on the fringes of Elysea, we know about it.</p>

         <p>There are eight Holy Templars working in different places in Elysea. Find them and receive their signatures. I need proof that you met them.</p>

         <p>On your way back, see High Priest Jucleas, give him the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_relic_01], and take the ritual of affirmation. That blesses your endeavor and ensures you're striving fairly, challenger.</p>
