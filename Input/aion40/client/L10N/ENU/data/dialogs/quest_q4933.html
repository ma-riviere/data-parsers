          <p>Empyrean Lord Marchutan is concerned about the balance of Destiny, and how it may be disturbed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where there is life, there is death. Daevas have transcended death, but they are maintaining the balance of Destiny through endless duty and service.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the world is darkening, rampant with destruction. There are too many deaths in the world at present.</p>

          <p>Asmodae is filled with hatred. Hatred toward the Balaur, hatred toward Elyos...and everyone is desperate to stand at the forefront to slay their enemies.</p>

          <p>Disciples of Destiny must know that there is a price to pay for all these wars.</p>
