          <p>[%username]! I've heard only a brief report from Tumblusen, but the whole story must be fascinating. The reports from that area have been so depressing lately that I didn't even want to read them!.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell me of your remarkable achievements in full.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must know how you've become so formidable! Perhaps we should give all of our Daevas amnesia! Ha!</p>

          <p>There are many people who say that peace in Eltnen has been restored thanks to you. It may not last, but we're glad of this respite, and one of the things we're running low on these days...is heroes.</p>
