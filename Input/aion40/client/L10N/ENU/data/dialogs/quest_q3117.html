          <p>I think I might be the first Elyos to see the inside of the Adma Stronghold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been looking around for things that could earn me some extra Kinah, but pretty much the only thing in there is swarms of the Undead. Scraps of bone and tattered cloth aren't very profitable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although, I did see someone who looked like [%dic:STR_DIC_E_L_DF2a_Q3117] with a valuable comb in her hair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might be worth trying to get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q3117a]. If you do, take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Esclados]?</p>

          <p>I know Atropos ordered us to investigate the Aetheric Field, but it's not profitable, and I'm not interested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I assigned it to Rovilance. Rookies have to be good for something--and besides, he needs the experience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So of course, he sends you to come bother me. What trivial nonsense has he found?</p>

          <p>Oh! Well! That's not what I was expecting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you say you got it from Princess Karemiwen? The inscribed name says Ntuamu, though... Well, that's not that important. We'll definitely get a good price from the Shugos for this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and one more thing: tell Rovilance that I told you this was worthless. It's not, but that way we only have to split the profits between the two of us.</p>

          <p>Esclados said it's very valuable, but asked you to keep that a secret from Rovilance.</p>
