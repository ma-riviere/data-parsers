          <p>Well, he did suggest a way for me to pay off my debt, dirty little cheat that he is! He wants me to bring him the treasure box hidden in that shipwreck down the coast. He must think there's something awfully valuable inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The trouble is, I'm stuck guarding the Observatory. It's not like I can just flit off hunting treasure whenever I like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't like to ask, but could you help me?</p>

          <p>Thank you! Oh, this whole mess could be untangled sooner than I expected. If you follow the bend of the Cantas Coast and you will see the Mysterious Shipwreck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_OBJ_LF1a_JewelBox_Q1219] is hidden somewhere within the ship. You may have to hunt a bit, but I'd be very grateful if you could bring it to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, you may find more than one...just bring them all to be safe.</p>

          <p>Thank goodness! You're back--and safe, too. I was worried sick. Well, not sick exactly, but I did think of you for a couple minutes. Do you have the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_OBJ_LF1a_JewelBox_Q1219]?</p>

          <p>Numonerk is probably on his way to the Brigade General right now....</p>
