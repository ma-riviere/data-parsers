          <p>Forgive me, how rude of me. My name is Harmone, young Daeva. I'm looking for my father. But he left me long ago...left my mother before I was even born.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My mother, bless her spirit, always said he was the greatest, most handsome man she'd ever met. But to me, he'll always be just a heartless brute who abandoned his wife and daughter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He never even wrote us a single letter after he left. He didn't even attend mother's funeral.</p>

          <p>Oh, young Daeva, I'm only trying to find him because I promised my mother I would. It was her dying wish for me to meet him. I have been searching for many days now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard from some passing travelers that he was here in Heiron, so I came just as soon as I was able. But I've lost the one thing that will help him to remember me. It's just an old shoe, but he'll remember it. He'll remember my mother and me by it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Young Daeva, will you find my lost shoe for me? Will you help an old woman find her long-lost father?</p>

          <p>I have an idea where the shoe might be. On the way here, I stopped at Agairon Village for a few days to rest my tired legs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I met a nice man named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Noiyus] there. He said he would help me, so I told him everything that I just told you. I even showed him the shoe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then when I told him that my father was a Daeva living in Sanctum, a strange look came over his eyes. Something wasn't right with him. When I woke up the next morning, the shoe was gone. I know he had something to do with it.</p>
