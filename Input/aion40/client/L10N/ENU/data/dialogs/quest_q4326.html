          <p>Ever heard of Shadow Judge Kromede? She's at once infamous and obscure, as the Shadow Court puts a lot of effort into pretending she never existed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She used her position to steal items to gain power for herself. She even murdered one of her clerks, Robstin, when he turned against her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it hadn't been for efforts by Archon Nagelbaad and Judge Kaliga, she might have succeeded. Maybe even overthrown the Shadow Court.</p>

          <p>Apparently, she has an intense hatred for the Court and all Shadow Judges now. Considering their history, it makes sense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, she hates them so much that a lot of innocents have been getting hurt in the crossfire. Someone needs to put an end to this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear she's hiding out in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_toDF2_DFlame]. I think you might be the one to stop her once and for all.</p>

          <p>Glad to see you step up. Be careful, though; the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_toDF2_DFlame] has a lot more hazards than just Judge Kromede.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might even want to gather a few trusted allies. It would certainly make the going a lot easier.</p>

          <p>You know, I wonder if... No, that can wait for when you return. It would do you no good right now. Blood for blood, [%username].</p>

          <p>I never thought I'd see the day when a Daeva like you would refuse to help others in need. Or at least pick a good fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you're still so young.... I suppose I could go on a "kids today" rant, but I don't think you'd pay me the least attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, well. Kromede will be taken care of by someone who cares, eventually. You could've been the one to reap the rewards. Just think about that.</p>

          <p>Don't tell anyone I said this, but I was thinking about the official story on Kromede while you were gone. There are details that just don't make sense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe I'm being paranoid. Either way, the fact of the matter is that Kromede's crusade against the Shadow Court is putting everyone at risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't seem the type to have returned unsuccessful. I assume this means...?</p>

          <p>Hmm. Suddenly, I don't know how to feel about that. The Shadow Court will certainly rejoice, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, she was a Daeva. If she has a secret Obelisk stashed somewhere, she could yet return, and continue her attacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she does, I trust you'll be there to stop her again. Thanks for your aid, [%username].</p>

          <p>Schwaben was disturbed by reports that people were getting hurt because of the war between Judge Kromede and the Shadow Court.</p>

          <p>At his request, you attacked the Fire Temple and slew the corrupt judge. You returned to some ambivalence, but Schwaben gratefully gave you a reward.</p>
