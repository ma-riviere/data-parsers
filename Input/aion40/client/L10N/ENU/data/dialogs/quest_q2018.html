          <p>I hope you're here to help us reconstruct Impetusium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're right next to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_30], so a rebuilt Impetusium would give us strategic dominance over the Mau and over southern Altgard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But look around you--rebuilding these ruins is an overwhelming task. So let's put you to work, [%userclass].</p>

          <p>There are a million tasks to be done. But my biggest problem right now is the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadD_18_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something awakened them a few weeks ago and they rose out of the ground to attack our workers. As they draw near, you can sometimes hear them whisper about battling the Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because the Mau wiped them out, the Ancient Heroes are out for revenge--and they don't realize that we aren't Mau.</p>

          <p>Sadly, yes--we need the spirits disrupted so reconstruction work can resume. We're behind schedule as it is, and Commander Suthran is not known for his patience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You cannot permanently destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadD_18_An]s, but you can force them to dissipate for a while--and that buys us time. And time is something we desperately need.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Excellent. Now we have only a million-minus-one tasks to complete...until the spirits reconstitute themselves, that is. Then we're back where we started.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can actually make progress if we can appease the Ancient Heroes. And to do that, we must make it impossible for the Mau to summon the heroes' most hated foe: Umkata.</p>

          <p>I sent a message to the Fortress, and Centurion Morn came up with a plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau chieftain, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanFighterSQ_18_An], was notorious for his ferocity and bravery. The present-day Mau revere him and could theoretically summon Umkata's ghost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The Ancient Heroes died at Umkata's claws, so they're determined to prevent that. But if we--or you, to be precise--summon Umkata's ghost and destroy it while it's still weak, then the Ancient Heroes might rest in peace.</p>

        <p>The Ancient Heroes are locked into a cycle of destiny with Umkata--while they're determined to stop the Mau, they can't actually destroy him because that would break the cycle.</p> 
        <p> </p>
        <p>But you stand outside the cycle--you can destroy Umkata's ghost forever.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>To summon Umkata, you have to make an offering of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_18] at [%dic:STR_DIC_E_19]. Morn and I figured out what the three objects are: the bones of Umkata, his weapon, and his ceremonial earrings. Gather [%dic:STR_DIC_E_18], awaken Umkata, and get rid of him forever.</p>

          <p>We're fairly sure one of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanWarriorS_18_Ae]s or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanHunterS_17_An]s in the Black Claw village must have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2018A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_E_20]--with his earrings inside--is on a ledge somewhere north of Impetusium. It's guarded by ghosts, so be careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're also told that either [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AElemental1stD_18_An]s or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AElemental2ndD_18_An]s stole [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2018C] from the Mau, which is why they haven't summoned Umkata themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have all three, go to the shore south of Impetusium and find [%dic:STR_DIC_E_19]. If you offer [%dic:STR_DIC_E_18] at his grave, he will awaken. That's the moment to strike.</p>
