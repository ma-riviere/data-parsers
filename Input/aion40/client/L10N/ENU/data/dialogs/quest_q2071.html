          <p>Azphel himself says, "Know your enemy." If you're going to know your enemy here in Reshanta, you should learn how to speak like a Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It can be a matter of life and death. When a Balaur shouts "Charge!" or "Retreat!" you'll want to know which one they're shouting, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if we ever send you on a scouting mission, you'll be a lot more useful if you can overhear the Balaur plans. </p>

          <p>That's not as easy as it sounds. The Balaur language is ancient and difficult for Humans to pronounce. Even with a great instructor, it'd take years to learn the Balaur tongue the traditional way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But recently we figured out a shortcut.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first step is capturing a Balaur. Go to the Krakon and meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asynja]; she'll point you in the right direction.</p>

          <p>See the pillar over there? Lots of Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe the pillar is the remnant of an ancient Balaur weapon--I don't know much history. But they cluster around it. That much I do know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go there and catch a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_LizardmanFi_27_An]. Once it's badly wounded, it should give itself up for capture. Then bring it here.</p>

          <p>I've been waiting for you, [%username]. You're trying to learn the Balaur language, right? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We used to learn bits of the language from captured Balaur as they raged against their chains--and you don't exactly get a broad vocabulary that way.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>A Shugo inventor called Kaoranerk came up with it, actually--a machine that imparts an understanding of the Balaur language to a Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So rather than months of instruction, you get to learn it in an instant. You're quite lucky, [%username].</p>

          <p>That's where I sent the Ashikar--to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_D3]. Go straight along the fortress wall and you'll see him there.</p>
