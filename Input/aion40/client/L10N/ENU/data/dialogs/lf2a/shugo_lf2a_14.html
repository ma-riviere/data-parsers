          <p>It seems Daeva has nothing to fear from Nagrunerk.  Yet. If you don't know his name, then you are not a wanted criminal.</p>

          <P>Every wanted criminal knows of Nagrunerk, and fears him.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Right after you become wanted, your name will be on the list, and very soon you will see Nagrunerk...for the last time.</P>
