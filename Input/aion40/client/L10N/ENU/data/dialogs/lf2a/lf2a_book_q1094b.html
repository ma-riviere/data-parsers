          <p>Theobomos was intrigued by the Calydon Relics. Though primitive, they seemed to depict a being of godlike power--not Aion, but somehow related to him--buried under the earth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Calydons' worship of this being seemed centered around a certain hill. Theobomos sent for militia from the Stronghold to clear the Calydons away from the site so excavation could begin.</p>

          <p>He never imagined that the being in the carvings was real. There, buried under the hill, was a colossus made of strange metal, far beyond the command of any Human--or Balaur--technology.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seemed to be a massive war machine, but long broken, its inner workings dull and dead. Theobomos ordered that the site be kept secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He wanted leverage against the Empyrean Lords--he had never trusted them completely.</p>

          <p>As his assistant, I was sent to do research, but I learned nothing useful. Never before had there been a fully independent mechanical weapon like this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Theobomos worked hard on restoring what he was now calling Project Drakanhammer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It could move at his command, and it could fire beams of Aetheric energy from its eyes, but he was not confident it was ready for battle.</p>

          <p>Then the unthinkable happened. We all watched the sky in horror as we saw the Tower of Eternity crack in two.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Waves of angry Balaur surged into the cities, slaughtering everyone in their path. Even the Daevas could not stop them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos, seeing his people slain and his kingdom toppling, decided to activate Project Drakanhammer.</p>

          <p>It stirred to battle with an ozone crackle of Aether, humming a deep note as if singing a battle hymn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its mighty fists scattered the Balaur with ease. Its deadly beams disintegrated entire regiments of Drakan in mere moments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The people could scarcely believe in the strange defender. But they believed in their hope that they would save him.</p>

          <p>That hope was not to last. Just as it seemed the Balaur would be routed, the skies began to glow red with flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meteors pelted the land, and all of Theobomos began to burn. The colossus looked up as a great winged shadow fell over him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was the shadow of Fregion, most fearsome of the Dragon Lords.</p>

          <p>Fregion spewed a mighty gout of flame over the colossus, and its metal skin glowed white-hot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the Dragon Lord swooped down from the sky, taking up the colossus, and tearing it apart like a rag doll.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was destroyed in mere moments, rendered useless before the might of a Dragon Lord.</p>

          <p>Seeing the colossus destroyed so easily must have snapped Theobomos' mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seething with anger, he vowed to vanquish the Balaur himself. I tried to restrain him, but could barely contain his Daevic strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Screaming a battle cry, he took up his arms and flew off into the heart of the inferno.</p>

          <p>I escaped before the flames completely consumed the Stronghold. It was only through Aion's good graces that I was able to pass by the Balaur unnoticed while they reveled in the chaos they caused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I leave behind this record in the hope that Humanity survives the Cataclysm. Though Project Drakanhammer is now dead forever, perhaps one day another colossus will be found buried beneath the sands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps one day this perfect weapon will defeat the Dragon Lords forever.</p>
