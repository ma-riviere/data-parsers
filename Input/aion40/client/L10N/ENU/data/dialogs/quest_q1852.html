          <p>There are many different viable strategies in war. Hopefully you've realized that by now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if it doesn't make sense at first, their true worth makes itself apparent on the battlefield, sometimes to devastating effect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take what the Asmodians are currently doing, for example. We scoffed at first to see their forces, but...</p>

          <p>They flooded the battlefield with soldiers new to the Abyss. They were defeated relatively easily, but there were just too many of them....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only did they prove threatening just by sheer numbers, they distracted and pinned in our forces, allowing stronger Asmodians to do major damage elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to thin out the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Dgrade9]s so any repetition is less effective. Can I count on you?</p>

          <p>Do not go easy on [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Dgrade9]s. No matter how strong he is, he is an Asmodian, and valuable to their war effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We made the mistake of underestimating them, and the power of numbers. We must not repeat the error.</p>

          <p>Be sure to return to me once your mission is complete. As soon as it is, we must make another move against them.</p>

          <p>Calon told you that the Asmodians were trying a new strategy in the Abyss involving large numbers of relatively weak Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To weaken the strategy, he wanted you to kill Rank 9 Asmodian Soldiers wherever you encountered them in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wandered the battlefield, slaying Rank 9 Asmodian Soldiers you came across. Calon was grateful for your assistance.</p>
