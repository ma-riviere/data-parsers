          <p>Do you remember that dark destiny I showed you long ago? Hellion defeats you, and you lose consciousness.</p>

          <p>I assumed then that if you could defeat Hellion, it would change your fate, and the fate of Atreia. The sword changes that much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now a new truth has become apparent. It's not Hellion who defeats you, but your own uncontrolled power.</p>

          <p>Well, there's one bit of advice I'd give to anyone about any enemy--take the initiative.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Victory most often goes to the one who attacks first and keeps attacking until the fatal blow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never give your enemy time to pull himself together. Never stop attacking, even when they're on their last legs. Understand?</p>

          <p>Well, talent's important of course, but what if your enemy's more talented than you? What do you do? Run away? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Intelligence is the deciding factor, I think. Every enemy has weaknesses--use your intelligence to find them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What skills is your enemy using? In what order? In what combinations? Know your enemy to gain the advantage.</p>

          <p>You completed the Amulet of Insight with the help of Skuld, Ananta, Seznec and Kasir, and listened to advice on fighting the Elyos from Aegir, Heintz, Delris, Votan and Kvasir. When you returned to Munin, he said all that remains now are a few tasks. </p>
