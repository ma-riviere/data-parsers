          <p>Ah, [%username]! Good, you're still here.</p>

          <p>A letter from Grunn just arrived. That idiot. I mean, he's a genius, but...still an idiot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems we don't have a complete set of Defender's cores after all.</p>

          <p>Grunn says he "deduces the existence" of some other varieties of Defenders. I think that's Grunn-speak for "completely missed."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need intact cores from a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_LightGuardian_50_An] and a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_DarkGuardian_50_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know, this is hardly your fault. But...I still have enough "discretionary research funds" to make it worth your while.</p>

          <p>Grunn might be an idiot, but he's a very clever sort of idiot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note this part of the letter: "The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_LightGuardian_50_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_DarkGuardian_50_An] do not coexist...."</p>
