          <p>How much do you know about the Lepharist Revolutionaries, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Probably the same as most of us--anarchist bandits who set up camps, steal local resources, and stir up discontent. They spread sedition and openly blaspheme against the Seraphim Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't understand them and I don't know what they want--that troubles me. There's a sighting along the Cantas Coast, and I'd like you to look into it.</p>

          <p>The Lepharists are pretending to be ordinary sailors or beachcombers, but our scouts know it's them, and we have to assume their target is the Verteron Observatory. If the Observatory is compromised, we'll be completely exposed to attack.</p>

          <p>She's watched over the Observatory for many years, and she knows the Cantas Coast intimately. She also has an...unusual gift. She can detect even the tiniest anomaly in the flow. She once told me it was like "listening to the taste of melting stars."</p>

          <p>This has to do with our uninvited guests by the shipwreck, yes? I'm glad they hear my warnings in Sanctum. I told them there are strange things in the Aether flow. Ripples whispering like phosphor, outraged, gathering like stormclouds, straining at the leash.</p>
