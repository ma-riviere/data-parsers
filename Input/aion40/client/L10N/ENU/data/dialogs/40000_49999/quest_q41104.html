          <p>The Balaur are the biggest threats to us in Sarpan. But they're not the only threats, not by a long shot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Urugugu Strigik and the Humnaz Tribe Calydon both claim territories in Sarpan. They're fine when they stay on their land--we can share Sarpan with other creatures, not like the Balaur--but when they stick their beaks and snouts beyond their borders, we start feeling less charitable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's one particular agitator in the Urugugu Garrison, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Owllau_Fi_57_Nmd_An], who's been ruffling some feathers. And on the Humnaz side, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_CalydonFi_57_Nmd_An] is eager to prove his tusks to his Chief. Both are Sandstorm Targets, so take your pick.</p>

          <p>Not a simple task, but I knew I could count on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll admit, I have a measure of respect for both the Calydon and the Strigik. They're powerful warriors, carving out a precarious existence in the same tough circumstances that we Reians are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't respect them enough to let 'em stomp all over my own people. For peace in Sarpan, [%userclass]!</p>
