        <body>
          <p>I have been studying Drana for a long time. A long, long time. And there hast been no ill effects to mine research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hrm.... What was I saying? Oh, yes, Drana. If I could determine how it grows, how it thrives, I can figure out how to kill it quickly, kill it efficiently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I will need samples, many samples, especially [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41164A]. That in particular is fascinating!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find them in piles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41164A_q] in the west of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1]. Would you mind helping me out? For the good of Atreia!</p>

          <p>Ah, Drana.... Nothing is so interesting! Mayhap this world might be better with Drana hanging betwixt every bough and peak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hrm? Oh, [%username]! You startled me! I was just thinking about... something. I don't recall what it was now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you get my samples? I would love to continue my research.</p>

          <p>Careful? But of course I am careful! I always limit my exposure, though I oft muse on the raw might of thine masters, the Dragon Lords....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Erm. I lost my train of thought there. Oh, yes, samples! These are wonderful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My research will continue apace thanks to you! When I find a way to mass-destroy Drana, I'll be sure to thank you personally!</p>

          <p>Morphius is studying Drana to figure out how it grows and how to destroy it, but needs more samples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You brought Herbivorous Drana that feed on plants. He was very excited, though perhaps slightly affected by his research subject.</p>
