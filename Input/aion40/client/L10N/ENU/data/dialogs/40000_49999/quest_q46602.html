		<p>Do you know how many Charlirunerk's Daemons there are? No? Neither do I! But there must be many, because I am so busy. And because we get all sorts of jobs done!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I wonder if I will ever meet all Daevas who are Daemons? Maybe I should start collecting signatures so I can keep track? Can I get yours?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Oh, but first, we should take care of business. You have tokens to bring me, nyerk?</p>

		<p>Ten Tokens? That means many jobs have been cleared, and many people have been helped!</p>

		<p>Some Daemons join for money and rewards, and that is all right. But I really admire the ones who join to help people.</p>
