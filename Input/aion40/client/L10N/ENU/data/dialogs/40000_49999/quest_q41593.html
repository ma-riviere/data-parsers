          <p>While all the others are thinking up new ways to kill the Balaur, I've come up with a novel approach: make us invincible!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've set up an Aether Defensive Shield in front of the Siege Troop Garrison. Once it's powered fully, it should deter the Balaur from attacking, and help protect us from other assaults. There's just one catch: it needs recharging.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone to take an Aether Crystal to the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_Q41593A] and power it. It shouldn't take long. Could you help, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Good. I was waiting for you.</p>

          <p>Is the shield charged? Were there any problems?</p>

          <p>Perfect. Thank you so much!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should help our defenses for now. And, as you know, the longer we can hold the Balaur off, the longer we can pummel their walls with our siege weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work, friend! This is for you.</p>

          <p>Solas told you that the Aether Defensive Shield, while useful, will not be 100% effective until it is charged with Aether Crystals. Ever willing to help, you took a crystal and powered the shield generator with it, safeguarding the area for the time being.</p>
