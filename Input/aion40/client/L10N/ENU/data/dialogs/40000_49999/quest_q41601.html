          <p>[%username], how do you feel about a little headhunting? And I don't mean in an employment sense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've had five bounties out for weeks now, but all the soldiers who've gone to claim them have failed to come back alive. I need someone powerful, someone like you, perhaps, to claim one of them, and show the others they're not as powerful as the spreading rumors suggest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Rottentree_Flower_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Guardian_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Unicorn_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_YunAs_Named_58_An], or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Yun_Named_59_An] killed. Obviously, the reward's going to be significant.</p>

          <p>Outstanding!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully that'll instill some confidence in the other bounty hunters. Funny how a couple of deaths can shake up the lot of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's your reward, friend. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Ur told you about five monsters that were marauding through his lands. Though he'd set bounties on them, no-one had been able to claim them, causing the hunters to grow weary of their threat. You were sent to kill one of the five, thereby showing the others that there was nothing to fear.</p>
