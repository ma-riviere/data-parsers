          <p>I don't know if Kesaos told you this, but the Strigiks know we're here, so they've been raising poisonous creatures to harry us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've definitely been doing it with Dionae, so I wouldn't be surprised if they were releasing Sheluks as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3] is fairly swarming with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Sheluk_Worm_57_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're a powerful [%userrace] Daeva! Could you kill some for us? It'll help us against the Strigik.</p>

          <p>Of course, watching the Strigik isn't our only task. We also hunt local animals for food and other necessities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every little bit helps, but with all the poisonous beasts around, even doing that is a lot harder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd have some breathing room without those blasted [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Sheluk_Worm_57_An]s.</p>

          <p>You did? Great! I'd better get out there and do some hunting before their numbers bounce back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kesaos and I have lost a lot of time to poisonings, both of ourselves and our escorts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not having to worry about that, even for a little while, is a great boon. Thanks!</p>

          <p>Narudel complained about the various poisonous creatures around the Hunter's Blind, especially Venomtip Sheluks.</p>

          <p>You helped him out by killing many and returned to Narudel's great relief.</p>
