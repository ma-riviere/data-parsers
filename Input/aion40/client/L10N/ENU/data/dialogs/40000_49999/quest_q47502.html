          <p>Anyone ordered into Tiamaranta deserves a lot more than a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47502A] for their courage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, every little bit helps. You should be proud that you're contributing to toppling Tiamat, even in this small way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll take a look at what you've created now and see if it's worthy for deserving Daevas.</p>
