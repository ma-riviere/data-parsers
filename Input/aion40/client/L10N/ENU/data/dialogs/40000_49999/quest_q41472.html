          <p>I've heard you are planning on obtaining a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_60lvDeva_wepon], [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had the same goal, but it seems that I'm not worthy enough. Complete my mission for me, and I'll give you all of the Essences of Dark Emotion that I've collected so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be easy. You'll have to defeat one of these enemies: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_05_Raksha_Nmd_60_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_Nmd_7Named_60_Ah], or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Tahabata_Named_60_Ah].</p>

          <p>I suppose I should have told you this first, but Siel's Spear has strict rules against using essences collected by someone else when you're gathering materials for a Luminasiel weapon.</p>

          <p>I won't tell if you don't. You still had to work hard to get these materials, right?</p>
