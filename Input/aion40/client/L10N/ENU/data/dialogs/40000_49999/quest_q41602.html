          <p>I knew that Tiamaranta was a dangerous place, but even I underestimated the threat constantly besieging us here. Between the Fields of Fire and Avad Village, we're practically surrounded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a member of the Sandstorm Legion, I need to address this. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Mosbear_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Elementalfire_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Elementalfire4_Named_59_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Displacerbeast_Rage_Named_59_An], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Fanatic_Named_59_An] are the most problematic targets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could eliminate at least one of them, it would buy us some much needed breathing room.</p>

          <p>Perhaps now my resources won't be stretched so thinly. Even so, I must take problems as they come day by day.</p>

          <p>I know you feel the same satisfaction I do in a job well done, but still, there's nothing quite like physical rewards, is there?</p>
