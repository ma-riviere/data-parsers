		<p>I remember when we just handed out these combat supplies to all the soldiers, even snot nosed recruits. Then Commander Payreev found our combat supplies in the inventories of Shugo traders, and the entire Blood Crusade received an oral castigation.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>The Governor wasn't thrilled either, so now we issue Crusader Tokens for completed missions, and then I take those tokens for crates of combat supplies.</p>

		<p>I suspect blind and chastened Shugo pack these combat supplies, because the contents are more or less shoved in at random.</p>

		<p>But I can determine the grade of the supplies inside, so bring me more marks to receive better supplies. Seven marks, [%username]? Well, you're a regular dynamo on the battlefied...are you sure you don't want to collect 15 or 30 marks for better supplies?</p>
