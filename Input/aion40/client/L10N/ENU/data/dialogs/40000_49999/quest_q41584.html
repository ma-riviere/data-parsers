          <p>Looks like time, the elements, and the Dust Twister haven't been kind. This ring shone like a star when I wore it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an old family heirloom. It represents our strength and pride. I won't let it stay in such awful condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41584a] from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Fungy_58_An]s is just acidic enough to clean items like this without harming the metal itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I have to get it myself, I won't get to it for years. Could I ask you a favor?</p>

          <p>I can't imagine what I would've done if I'd gone home without the ring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My family would've understood, of course, but I think I would've punished myself all the more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I can finally put things the way they were, the way they should be. As long as I get some Mookie's Sap...</p>

          <p>I know. They are cute, aren't they? But never forget they're also vicious monsters who'd just as soon kill you as look at you.</p>
