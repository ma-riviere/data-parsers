          <p>We Reians have become adept killers over the centuries. From Balaur to Brax, we have no issue tearing them apart in the defense of our home. But there is one enemy even our hardiest warriors wince at having to destroy: dead Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are raised to pay respect to all dead creatures. Animals are buried, the Balaur are placed on funeral pyres, and our own choose their manner of passing. Seeing the souls of our own people wandering our lands breaks our heart, yet they must be dealt with before they come to harm us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Koligran challenge has been set for you. You must annihilate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Fi_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Wi_58_An]s wandering through Sabat's End. Complete your task and you'll receive a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_01].</p>

          <p>Then I thank you. I trust you dealt with them as quickly as you could have. I will pray for you tonight, friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our folktales tell stories of the dead coming back to haunt the dreams of their killers. Perhaps, if they are true, the men and women you destroyed will thank you tonight for freeing them from their troubles.</p>
