          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ice Claw Mau have been increasing their attacks of late. Your mission is to put them in their place and collect their Vined Amulets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Amulets may be carried by a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KeA_LycanKnightM_28_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KeC_LycanKnightM_30_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AeA_LycanAssassinM_29_Ae], or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_PeA_LycanPriestM_29_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go with a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] to the Ice Claw Village, and bring me the Amulets you get. Keep your eyes open and be willing to learn.</p>

          <p>Missions like this keep the Ice Claw Mau from acting too boldly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plus, I hear rumors that a high Pandaemonium noble likes to collect Vined Amulets. Do you have any to give me?</p>

          <p>But not enough. Remember, if you don't work closely with your Mentor in all ways, you won't get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_48605a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's a dangerous place, but that's another reason the Mentor is there. Trust your Mentor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is for your own development, [%username]. I advise you to take it seriously.</p>

          <p>I hope your tenure under your Mentor went smoothly. At the very least, you've gained some valuable combat experience.</p>

          <p>Oh, speaking of valuables, take this too, for a job well done.</p>
