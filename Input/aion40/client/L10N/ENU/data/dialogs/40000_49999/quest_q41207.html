          <p>I've been gathering herbs in Sarpan for a long time, but some places still manage to get the better of me. What surprised me the most here were the Arachnas. Have you seen them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their coloring blends well with the forest. It's nearly perfect camouflage, and that makes them quite dangerous if you're focused on the plants... like me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you please eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_Octaside_leaf_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_Octaside_leaf_R_58_An]s in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1]?</p>

          <p>I think some strange power is working through the entirety of Sarpan, not just Anaz Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm unsure whether it's related to Tiamat, but it feels malicious just the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What about the Arachnas? It was more daunting than you imagined, right?</p>

          <p>I'd love to give you something valuable as a reward, but this is the best I can offer. Herbalists may be dedicated, but they're not rich.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a token of my appreciation. Please, take it.</p>
