          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Beluslan area Field Wardens have come under attack by Alpine Gorgons recently. Our Pandaemonium Research Lab seems to indicate that this sudden aggression is likely caused by exposure to [REDACTED] [REDACTED], a strange toxic substance recently [REDACTED] by [REDACTED] [REDACTED] agents in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there appears to be no way to reverse the effects of this toxin, and so we require all Field Wardens to dispatch any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonWhiteD_37_n]s they come across to minimize the effects of the exposure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We do not believe that this madness is contagious, but to be certain all Wardens should otherwise minimize contact with these creatures. In the event of [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED] [REDACTED], you will be...contacted personally by another Field Warden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Report the results of your termination efforts to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>I wonder if whoever spread those toxins around Beluslan regrets it now. Whatever the intent was--maybe to cause panic--it's clear now there have been unintended consequences. Maybe these mad Gorgons are only the beginning....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish we didn't have to terminate these poor beasts, but if this condition is contagious.... If it spreads to other creatures, or even Asmodians.... Well, let's just hope that doesn't happen.</p>

          <p>I hope no one at the Pandaemonium Research Lab gets fired for taking so long to report this. All this could have been minimized, or maybe avoided....</p>
