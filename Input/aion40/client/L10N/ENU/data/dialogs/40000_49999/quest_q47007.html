          <p>Task: Eliminating the Mist Mane Mau</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Military leaders in Morheim are increasingly concerned by Mist Mane Mau.</p>

          <p>Sapiens may not seem like as big a threat as the Balaur, and in a way, they're not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they're certainly a more direct threat, and their dealings with our hated foes make them a serious issue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you and your Mentor put those kitters in their place.</p>
