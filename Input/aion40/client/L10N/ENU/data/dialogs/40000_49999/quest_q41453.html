          <p>Now, this final challenge requires perseverance, an affinity with our natural world, and an awareness of its predators. These are all qualities that Siel's Spear legionnaires must possess. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must gather [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41453b_01] droplets from various [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41453_list], all the while avoiding the creatures that will be looking to attack you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and take this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41453a_01]. It may have lost its luster, but tradition dictates that all who take this test must wear the ring. Who knows--it might just bring you luck!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've collected enough droplets, come back with another [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_02]. Good luck!</p>

          <p>I'm glad you're back. I'd be surprised at your speed, but I'm afraid I know you too well at this point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, this is the hurdle that most applicants fall at. I suspect they hear the details, and run off thinking they'll be back by supper, only to spend countless hours struggling through our lands as all manner of creatures attack them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shock is just too jarring for most. Most... but not you, I feel. Let me see what you found.</p>

          <p>Kahrun gave you your third assignment: to collect Noble Dew droplets from the natural resources around Sarpan and Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took a long, long time, but with the ring handed to you by Kahrun, you were finally able to gather the droplets that you needed. On your return, Kahrun congratulated you, but hinted that there was an issue with your application.</p>
