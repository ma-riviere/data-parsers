        <body>
          <p>We can't go through [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_calydon_fam] territory alone anymore--the Humnaz easily overpower us. It wasn't always like this. Used to be that the Humnaz were too frightened to set a trotter over territorial lines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm going to bring those days back, [%username]. I'm looking for additional members to my Old-Timey Sarpan Humnaz Mop-up Band. We will put the Calydon back in their place!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? It's a good name! It's catchy!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we've got competition. The Humnaz have created their own counterforce. I need your help eliminating them before the Old-Timey Sarpan Humnaz Mop-up Band goes in to clean up. Could you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A4_04] and take out the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41183all]?</p>

          <p>Did you see the Whistlin' Piggies Humnaz Jug Band?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aren't they awful? Apparently they got their name because they whistle dirges through their wicked tusks on their way to battle, and they drink these big jugs of fortifying liquor every morning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it doesn't have the same ring to it as the Old-Timey Sarpan Humnaz Mop-up Band. Not at all.</p>

          <p>This'll really get the Old-Timey Sarpan Humnaz Mop-up Band ahead. Remember our name, [%username]!</p>

          <p>We're going to be famous, and you'll be able to say that you knew us back in the day!</p>

          <p>Thuros lamented the old days, when the Humnaz Calydon were afraid of Reians. He formed a band of fighters to regain Reian supremacy, but they were met by Humnaz competition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked you to go into Humnaz territory and take out the Elite Soldiers in the Whistlin' Piggies Humnaz Jug Band, so that the Reian's Old-Timey Sarpan Humnaz Mop-up Band could take over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did, and Thuros was grateful that you'd helped his team get ahead.</p>
