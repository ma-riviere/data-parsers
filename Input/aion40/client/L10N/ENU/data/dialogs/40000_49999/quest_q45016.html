          <p>Loyal Field Warden hero:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to reports from Pandaemonium, an unknown group has distributed dangerous substances in Brusthonin--or so they said.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These substances apparently look like regular stones, but can disturb Aetheric Field devices. Disabling them is up to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That all possible speed must be used should go without saying, before chaos erupts in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Effective immediately, it is the duty of all Wardens to disable [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45016]s and bring to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45014] any remnants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember that all Asmodae falls under the Field Wardens' protectorship.</p>

          <p>Who could be perpetrating this terrible crime on the people of Asmodae? Spreading deadly substances around.... Balaur, or their underlings? The Sun-poxed Elyos? Perhaps traitors, among our own people...?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Idle supposition, of course. The important thing is not who did it, but that we contain this danger immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, if you find any Chaotic Fragments, destroy them and bring me the evidence to pass along.</p>

          <p>Ah. Excellent work, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium will hear of this small but important victory. They are eager to learn who is behind this strange series of events, and will no doubt increase our funding to allow us to broaden the search.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blood for blood, Warden. I will trade you that letter for a token of our esteem.</p>
