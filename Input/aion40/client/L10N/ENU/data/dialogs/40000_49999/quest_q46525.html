          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: An escaped thief who took the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_46525a] during his time as a fugitive.</p>

          <p>No, not even I know who client is or what letter is about. Every Daemon who talked to me today asked same things!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear letter has magical seal on it, so you would not be able to read it anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also hear client is camped outside President's office, anxiously awaiting letter! Can you help him?</p>

          <p>Client is only interested in [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_46525a]! So you better hurry, before he goes insane!</p>

          <p>That is it! Client description was very detailed.</p>

          <p>Hmm, I still cannot open it. Client will probably be relieved at that, though.</p>
