          <p>So, Geology 101! Gravity crushes, after millions of years creates gemstones, and the Cataclysm created our mountains and valleys. All fine and dandy, except for here.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>"Why here", I hear you ask! Well, that's what we're trying to find out. The fissure was created recently, and has no geological reason to exist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is where you come in, my budding apprentice! I need you to seek a [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S11] and collect [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4B_FOBJ_T1_GemStone] samples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can analyze those stones, you see, and work out where they came from and when. Now, off you go!</p>

          <p>Excellent work! These will do nicely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm... interesting, and what a peculiar color. These will certainly require a great deal of study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you. Please, a good day's work is not without its reward. Take this.</p>

          <p>Grido wanted to understand the origins of the great Fissure Barrens. You collected gemstones for him from a Small Crater, which were apparently very unusual and required further study.</p>
