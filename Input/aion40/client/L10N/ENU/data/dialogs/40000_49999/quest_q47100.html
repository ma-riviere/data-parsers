          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracles believe that Daevas now, or soon to be, in Altgard Fortress have much potential that needs nurturing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your mission is to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_10_19](s) you choose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, you must work together to open the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q47000]s located around the fortress and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_47000a]s for inspection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon completion, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rancier], who will take the Crystal Balls and reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>Potential wasted.... That is the greatest tragedy that could ever befall Asmodae, and it happens much too often.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While it's not The Circle's sole purpose, preventing that is definitely our primary goal.</p>
