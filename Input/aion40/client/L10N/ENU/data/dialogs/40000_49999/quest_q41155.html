          <p>Ah, hello, Daeva! Now, let me see, are you Asmodian or Elyos? I can't tell the two apart yet although I'm told there are major differences.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you're all similar enough to our Reian people. Except for those remarkable wings of yours, we could all be family, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One great family, united against Balaur tyranny. An inspiring idea, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Tell me, Daeva, what do you think of Kahrun's truce between your peoples? Do you think it will hold?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me, I think it's the calm before the storm. But as long as Tiamat is out of the picture when the weather breaks, it's fine by me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once we crush the Dragon Lords together, you can all go home and slaughter your brethren till the Brax come home, for all I care.</p>

          <p>Excellent. You will do well here, [%username].</p>

          <p>I have one more piece of advice for you. I implore you, honor the laws set by Kahrun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The balance between Asmodian and Elyos is delicate, the diplomacy tenuous. Our mission is too important to let old grudges influence our actions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime, I will send prayers to the Lady of the East on your behalf.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You spoke to two Reians working at the Elyos and Asmodian boarding sites, then returned to Ulstia to report your progress. She warned you to heed Kahrun's laws.</p>
