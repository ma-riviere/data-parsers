          <p>Ugh, I am constantly befuddled from the dizzying fumes in this wretched place... or maybe I'm just hungry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't really remember the last decent thing I ate. I would eat anything right now. Even when I look at the hideous creatures around the Springs, I can't help but salivate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's horribly savage, I know. But I wager that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Varanus_Spring_58_An] has some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41532a] on it. Please, fetch some... as a favor to a desperate man.</p>

          <p>I'd be happy with even a little pot of Chersnip stew.</p>
