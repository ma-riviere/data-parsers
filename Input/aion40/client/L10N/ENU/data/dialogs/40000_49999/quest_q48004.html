          <p>My, this bridge is crowded today. Everyone coming and going, and some of them leaving messages behind as they pass.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I live for messages. I like nothing better than writing down messages--nothing except delivering them, of course. Did you read any sarcasm in that? Because it was intended.</p>

          <p>Indeed there is, [%username]. A member of the Blood Crusade was here not an hour ago.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if the Primum Fortress is your destination, you have to go to the Morheim Ice Fortress first. Let me know if you're going to leave now and I'll send you to Morheim.</p>

          <p>[%username]! You're late!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been standing here all day jawing at sun-addled dimwits like Tostig! Let me get straight to the point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear you've cracked a few skulls and bled your fair share of beasts, and I'm looking for a real hellion to join the Blood Crusade. Unlike those numbskulls in the regular army, we don't rush into battle head first and wind up at the Obelisk faster than I can say Azphelumbra. We act as individuals or in small units, and carry out small scale missions integral to the war effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Lord Azphel is Asmodae, then we're his right hand.</p>

          <p>We need new members. Men and women who never back down, never retreat, and know how to handle themselves on the battlefield. Even the newest Blood Crusader is worth ten of those sun-blighted Elyos cowards. Well...then there's Tostig, who just happens to be the Governor's nephew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not going to lie, the work will be dangerous, and survival isn't guaranteed. But I think you'd make a fine addition to the Special Operations Command. So...how about it, [%username]? If you're interested, speak with me again and we'll get started right away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now...Tostig looks bored, perhaps I'll send him out for Elroco horns. I wonder how long it'll take him to realize they don't exist.</p>
