          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our normal means of acquiring weapons has dried up, and Pandaemonium has been somewhat slow to respond. We are now working with our Research Lab to open a new Weapons Production Division, with the hope of ultimately creating weapons at lower costs. This will be crucial in our efforts to properly deal with hostile forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the raw materials that the lab requires to begin the manufacturing process are in short supply in Pandaemonium. As such, we are asking our fellow Field Wardens to contribute [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45041_a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45041_b]. Turn in any gathered materials to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alaum] in Brusthonin, who will see that they make their way through proper channels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Have you heard about the situation with our weapon supplier? Pandaemonium doesn't care--as far as they're concerned, we can just all make our own weapons out of Aether, or Mist, or whatever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obviously it's not entirely their concern. The Field Wardens are an independent entity with no official support from "above," but we had an understanding.... I guess nothing lasts forever, does it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping that more Wardens would be contributing to supplying our new lab with raw materials, but we've had a sharp drop in membership lately. I wonder if it's related to that incident with the Dredgion. Have you heard anything?</p>

          <p>Hmmm.... I believe that the first weapon the lab wants to produce utilizes Orichalcum and Asvata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure if it's a sword, or a spear, or something else they're working on, but I've heard it's going to be fairly deadly. And quite cheap, if the Wardens can manage to contribute the raw materials at zero cost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you haven't brought anything with you, obviously you can see why I use the word "if" in that sentence.</p>

          <p>Excellent work, Warden. Did you collect these or buy them from someone else? I don't mind either way, but since the point of this is to save money, it would seem foolish to....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well that's not for me to worry about, is it? Your commitment to the Field Wardens has been amply demonstrated, either physically or financially, and no one can slight you for that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do take this token for your time.</p>
