          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun]? He is a hard one to know, though you are wise to ask. His is the will of the Reian people personified. If you know him, then you come to know us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has unified our tribe, taught us to speak with one voice and to confront the Balaur with united force. With his guidance, the Reian people have made unprecedented headway in pushing the Balaur out of Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have great faith in him, [%username], and as you see his power in action, I believe you will as well.</p>
