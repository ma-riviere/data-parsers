          <p>There's a soul connected to this crystal! It's not inside, but it is nearby. I've done some tests and consulted some colleagues. With a little magic, it turns out, you should be able to communicate with the soul. But that magic requires components. The nearby [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Silika_59_Ae]s should be able to help us with that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you mind dispatching a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Silika_59_Ae]s for their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41574a]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The magic part of this is a little outside my comfort zone, but I'm becoming quite the crystal expert. It's time to crack this Mamut Skull mystery wide open, [%username]!</p>

          <p>I've been looking forward to your return, [%username]! You've gotten my curiosity stirred, and I can't think of anything but that Mamut Skull! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm dying to know what secrets it holds. I need to figure this out, or I'll never get anything else done. Ha!</p>

          <p>Perfect! With this, we can find out about that Mamut. By Kahrun's Eyes, what an adventure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, [%username], I can surely find plenty of work for you if you'd like to come work for me. Ah, just think about it. Ha!</p>
