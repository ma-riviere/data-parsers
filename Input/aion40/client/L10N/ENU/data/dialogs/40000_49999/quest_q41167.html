          <p>Luman Village, Menin Village... do you know of these places, [%username]? Both are--were--Reian farming villages north of here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both have been destroyed by Dredgions. Now only [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_01] is left, but they are barely holding on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just received an urgent message from Garldar's General Goods Merchant, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Addiru]. It goes into little detail, but it's clear something is terribly wrong. I need a strong Daeva to investigate. Please, I beg of you....</p>

          <p>What isn't? The Shulacks and Balaur.... They're plotting! Scheming! I know they are! They always are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I should've let the elder send for help, but he's shut himself in his house in despair. There's no leadership here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank Aion a strong Daeva like you is here. Now perhaps we can work towards saving this village.</p>
