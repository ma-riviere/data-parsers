          <p>Ex... (cough) Excuse me! I hate to bother you, kind Daeva, but if I could make a small request of you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My husband, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Joubis], told me that he would return to me yesterday, but I have not seen... (cough) Seen him all day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would look for him myself, but I am feeling... unwell today, and I don't think I have the energy to undertake a search.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He must be outside the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2_01]. If you could find him and ask him when he's coming home, I would appreciate (cough cough) it.</p>

          <p>Ahem. I'm sorry. I've just been so worried about her. She's been ill for quite a long time now.</p>

          <p>I should've gotten in touch with her earlier, but I have something I must do. Hmm. Perhaps you can help....</p>
