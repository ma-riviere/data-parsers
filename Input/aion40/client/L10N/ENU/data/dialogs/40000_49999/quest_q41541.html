          <p>I do my duty for my people and for Atreia, but I do wish I had more time to put into my grooming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It takes time to look this good, but I have to spend precious hours battling those ugly [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_MutantBeast_60_An]es!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fewer of them there are, the more time I have to fix my hair and choose my clothes. Can you help me out, in the name of fashion?</p>

          <p>Oh, well, I'll figure it out later. Did you have any luck with the Silverake Kalbases?</p>

          <p>That's just something ugly people say. Not that I think you're ugly, [%username]... not completely, anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now I finally have some ME time. I'll use it to do some tailoring and to give my hair the lustrous sheen it once had.</p>
