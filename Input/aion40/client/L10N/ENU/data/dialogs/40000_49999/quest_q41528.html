          <p>When I first came to the Steam Springs, I didn't think things would be quite THIS bad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate breathing this wretched sulfuric air. And you can't even drink from the springs--we have to ration our water! I am constantly parched.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a monstrous plant that thrives here called the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Corn_Spring_58_An]. I'm not even sure if it is a plant, really... but I've seen it soaking its roots in the springs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It must have some method for filtering the water, so bring me some Frightcorn Filters and maybe I can solve our water situation.</p>

          <p>You've killed some of the awful Frightcorns?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their powers are fascinating, yet grotesquely macabre! Hopefully those Frightcorn Filters help....</p>

          <p>Ah, thank you. These are perfect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An elegant solution to the sulfuric waters around here... As long as I don't think too hard about where it came from.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm thirsty enough to drink Frightcorn-filtered water.</p>
