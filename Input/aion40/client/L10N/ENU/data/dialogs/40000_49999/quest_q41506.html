          <p>Before we can take the fight to them, we must scout the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_A3].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We know much about their defenses already but not enough. If we have any hope for success, we need to know our enemy as we know ourselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like you to go to the Balaur Cavalry Base and observe their training and routine. Report all details back to me.</p>

          <p>I see they are organized. Khapseb! This is more serious than I had imagined.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the number of Pagatis and Sikaras being trained is worrisome.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must take this matter up with Lieutenant Hiroten.</p>

          <p>You scouted the Training Camp and reported your findings. He said that it sounds more systematic than he had thought and told you that he'd have to discuss things with Hiroten.</p>
