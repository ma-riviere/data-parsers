          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The compass of destiny points you towards Morheim Observatory, where you are to investigate strange malfunctions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your mission is to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] to any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_30_39](s) you choose. Then help them repair [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q47006]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mephisto] will reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>It's a slang word now. And you're not here to correct my grammar, thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because you've guided the Daevas well and resolved a potentially disastrous problem at the Observatory, I can forgive your pedantry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe Lord Marchutan foresaw all this. I hope you continue to serve him well.</p>
