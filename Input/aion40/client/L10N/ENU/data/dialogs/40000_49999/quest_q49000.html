          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rodul] in the Marchutan Priory has been looking for you. I heard something about it being a very important mission, so you should probably hurry.</p>

          <p>Finally! What kept you? We finally succeeded in generating the Dimensional Vortex!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know what this means? No, of course you don't. Well, talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sala] and he'll explain what we need to do now.</p>

        	<p>Wait! You do know about the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In], right? Caused by Vanktrist Spacetwine, distorting space, all that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we learned that the collision was creating an integrated space, where pieces of Elysea and Asmodae overlapped. So we started to study it ourselves. If we could harness that power, we could have a strike force of Daevas sitting in Elysea at a moment's notice. Wouldn't that be worthwhile?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now, the Pandaemonium Dimensional Research Center has finally succeeded! The world is ours! That's it. Get going now! Salla's waiting!</p>

          <p>You went to the Marchutan Priory after hearing that Rodul was looking for you. He said that the development of the Dimensional Vortex had been successful, and Daevas could now freely enter Elysea. He then instructed you to talk to Salla at the Pandaemonium Operations Headquarters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Salla said that Theobomos had been chosen as the place for the first vortex battle. A skilled Daeva was needed to join the fight, which was where you came in.</p>
