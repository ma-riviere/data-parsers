          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracles believe that Daevas now, or soon to be, in Morheim Ice Fortress have much potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your mission is to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_20_29](s) you choose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, work together to repair [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q47003]s near the Fortress. Upon completion, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mephisto], who will reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>Yes, Morheim soldiers could've been sent to repair the Ward Globes, but that's not the point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theirs would be just another duty. For you and your allies, it was a learning experience.</p>
