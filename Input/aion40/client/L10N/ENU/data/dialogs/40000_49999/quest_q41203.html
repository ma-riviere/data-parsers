          <p>Okay, this time I'm sure I know what went wrong. But I need your help again. Can you collect samples from the broken-down Petrahulks around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why didn't I think of that before? I know, I know, I've been doing a lot of acting without thinking lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41203A]s should be scattered on the ground around the Anaz Forest. Five should be enough.</p>

          <p>I'm so sorry that I made a busy Daeva like you run around like this, cleaning up my mess. Believe me, I've learned my lesson.</p>

          <p>You've saved me and my reputation. And think of all the people who might've gotten hurt if you decided not to help me!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If I perform a reverse extraction from the magic in these samples, I can find out exactly where the energy resonated wrong. I just need to slow down and think about what I'm doing.</p>
