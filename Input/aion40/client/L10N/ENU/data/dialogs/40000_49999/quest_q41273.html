          <p>I've been having trouble getting supplies here. The deliveries are always escorted, of course, but the attacks are worsening.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The main problem is those Elite Satra Defenders. They protect the more aggressive troops, who go on to do more damage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't do business like this. Plus, the soldiers here end up constantly running low on needed goods, which is the Balaur's purpose, I'm sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva could do a lot of good going to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2] and killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_DrakanFi_Noweapon_58_An]s, I'd wager....</p>

          <p>This latest batch of supplies was attacked quite viciously. Barely anything made it here intact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it weren't for the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_DrakanFi_Noweapon_58_An]s, the escort could mop up the rest more easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I take it you got my... subtle hint about what could be done about that.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. I'm glad I communicated effectively. In my world, sometimes it's hard to tell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, you not only did me a service, but every Daeva stationed here. You have my, and their, thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks to Elite Satra Defenders, the Balaur have successfully attacked Ledios' suppliers, depriving everyone of much needed goods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Satrakand and killed the Defenders so that Ledios and the soldiers could get what they needed safely.</p>
