		<p>I haven't been on the battlefield for weeks! Curse the clumsiness that landed me this post! </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Oh sure, handing out combat supplies has its perks...I get to hear all about how other soldiers are dismembering Elyos by the dozens and bringing glory to Asmodae. The stories just keep pouring in, while I stand here wielding lordship over these crates of supplies. I guess I'm just lucky. So very, very lucky.</p>

		<p>What is it, [%username]? Find time to trade in tokens amidst the humdrum of immortal battle?</p>

		<p>It's admirable to see a Crusader acquire 30 marks. That [%mainslotitem] of yours must have have sealed the spirits of hundreds of Elyos Daevas. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I suppose the one good thing in all of this is that this war may never end. In a few hundred years, I might get another chance to fight, instead of just handing out supplies....</p>

		<p>Enough of that. Hand me your 30 Crusader Tokens.</p>

		<p>That's amazing, [%username]! So few Daevas have the ability to earn 60 Crusader Tokens; even fewer are sufficiently devoted to the cause to save up that many. I can hold nothing but sheer respect for soldiers of your caliber.</p>
