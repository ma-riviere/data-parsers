          <p>Loyal Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every day we do our best to guard the Aetheric Field, but we cannot grow complacent. The field's strength is ever-shifting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In recent days, we commissioned the Pandaemonium Research Center to create yet another Aetheric Field Monitor to watch the situation in Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring the Monitor Record from an [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45014] in Brusthonin to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45014].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only through vigilance will Asmodae prosper.</p>

          <p>Let's see.... What does your letter say? Hmmm...yes, it appears this is... It seems there was a...small flux in the Aetheric Field related to the...Eye of Reshanta, but I don't think it's anything serious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll report this to the other Field Wardens, [%username]. Your job is done here.</p>

          <p>You located the tower and brought the Monitor Record to the Brusthonin Field Agent, who said the small flux was nothing to be concerned about.</p>
