          <p>You know, my recent slip got me thinking. The Outrider who stored the ore with me told me why he had it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His superiors wanted to examine it to see how the Dragonbound make their weapons, and thus how to best counter their power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps if I help him by giving him actual [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41597a]s, I may further make up for my error.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could ask one more favor of you, return to Avad Village and find [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_Q41597A]s. Bring me their contents so I may give them to the Outrider.</p>

          <p>I talked to that Outrider. He was very understanding. I hope my superiors are as kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was very excited at the prospect of those Dragonbound Weapons, too. He said they'd be of great help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you got enough. I'd hate for you to exert yourself even further on my behalf.</p>

          <p>Ooof!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This should earn me further points with the Warehouser's Guild. Perhaps I'll only get a mark on my permanent record.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you. My mistake caused all this, yet you helped me anyway. You truly are compassionate.</p>

          <p>So you went to the Avad Village and took the weapons from the Dragonbound Weapon Chests. Sephira was very grateful for all you'd done to help her in her time of need.</p>
