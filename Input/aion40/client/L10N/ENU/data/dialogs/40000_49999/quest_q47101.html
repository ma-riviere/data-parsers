          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracles believe that Daevas now, or soon to be, attacking the Black Claw Outpost need aid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your mission is to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_15_25](s) you choose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, work together to defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q48601]s to reduce the threat of Mau forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon completion, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rancier], who will reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>Sometimes Lord Marchutan and the Oracles are mysterious. Not this time.</p>

          <p>I hear local forces have been having difficulties with the Black Claw Mau. Taking out their healers should alleviate the problems.</p>

          <p>You look a little weary, but not too much. I assume you shepherded your charges well?</p>
