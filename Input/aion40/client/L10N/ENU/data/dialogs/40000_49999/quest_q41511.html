          <p>Battles? Pah! Wars are not won in individual battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're won by efficient supply lines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But our hub, the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S2], has had difficulties lately. Would you go there and help [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aius]?</p>

          <p>You've got to be more stealthy, [%username]. I see you coming every time.</p>

          <p>That could be my own fault though. I keep such a vigilant watch these days. Largely because [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Slime_Snail_Sand_58_An]s keep taking supplies and rations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're so short-handed, we can't deal with them, and that only makes the situation worse.</p>

          <p>Reian Elder Tailos said wars are won on supply lines, not by battles. Then he asked you to help Adora Supply Depot, which had been less efficient lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you talked with Aius who complained the Oxide Sludgers were getting in the way of her people. When you terminated the Sludgers, she was relieved.</p>
