          <p>Oh, help, please! The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1] is just swarming with Petrahulks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have seen them attack peaceful folk as they walk through in the forest. Oh my, it's just awful!</p>

          <p>Have you gotten rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_CyclopsGuardQ_57_An]s? I've felt simply awful about this whole mess!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid the whole thing is my fault! You see, I ran a little experiment to see whether we could use the Petrahulks as laborers, but... well things went a little haywire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I forgot the part of the spell that let me keep control over them. I can never remember the right words. Oh, I'm a terrible sorcerer!</p>

          <p>I'm so busy trying to memorize all of these spells. It takes me so long that I don't have time to do the rest of my work, which why is why I tried to make the Petrahulks into laborers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Petrahulks are so stupid, I thought it would be easy to control them, but... oh, I'm so mad at myself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you!</p>
