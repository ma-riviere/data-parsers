          <p>As you may well know, the Balaur rule through sheer might and terror. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_DrakanWorker_suicide_57_An]s are an example.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are created with only one purpose: to die for the Balaur--and in a more direct manner than any other being.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine anyone else having troops whose only reason for life is to die? It's obscene. Even so, they must still be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_DrakanWorker_suicide_57_An]s in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2] die sooner or later. Why not by your [%mainslotitem]?</p>

          <p>I'm just a hair away from pitying the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_DrakanWorker_suicide_57_An]s. They never had a chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would've been better had they never lived at all, but ridding the world of them is the next best thing.</p>

          <p>I've decided not to pity your victims. They were created without mind or conscience, so they do not suffer.</p>

          <p>Killing them is like killing insects--except you don't do Atreia a service by swatting bugs. Fine work indeed.</p>

          <p>Out of both pity and practicality, she asked you to seek out and eliminate them. You did so and returned to proper reward.</p>
