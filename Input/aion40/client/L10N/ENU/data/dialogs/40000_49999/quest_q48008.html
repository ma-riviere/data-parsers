          <p>As the main gatekeeper to Pandaemonium, I have to treat the people I meet with dignity and respect.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>It's a responsibility I take seriously. Of course, these days, one responsibility executed well attracts twenty more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no pushover, of course--what Asmodian is? But for some reason, some people think I'll do anything they ask.</p>

          <p>For instance, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asharu] works for the Shapers of Dusk. He's holding a recruitment drive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, since I'm pretty much Pandaemonium's official greeter, he's asked me to spread the word about his organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Somehow, I ended up agreeing. Still, the work they do sounds pretty interesting. Maybe you should find out more about it?</p>

          <p>I haven't heard a lot about the Shapers of Dusk; they're relatively new. But I understand they have high-ranking patronage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems Lady Lumiel believes that crafting in general needs to play more of a role in the war effort, and she's willing to put in resources to make it happen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asharu] can probably tell you more.</p>

          <p>I know a lot of Daevas think that crafting is a waste of time, but I'm inclined to disagree.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For one thing, you save Kinah on whatever you make--Kinah that can be spent on more important things instead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plus, being part of a large organization, especially one supported by a Shedim Lord, could be useful to you. Think about it.</p>

          <p>We do this by offering benefits for crafting rewards that are given to our champions in Abyss and Balaurea campaigns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you consider joining. Here's a little something just for listening to my pitch. May the darkness grant you peace!</p>
