          <p>I wonder what the Shulacks are up to. Why would they snatch a random person?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you talk with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Elmeos] about this? Perhaps she has some insight.</p>

          <p>Those Shulacks with their silent tails... shattering suspicious!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's an idea I've been waiting to use. We disguise someone as a Shulack and infiltrate their organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To start, we need costumes. Can you get 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41171A]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_ShulackFi_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_ShulackRa_57_An]s in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_02]? We need that many in case of rips, tears, or sizing disparities.</p>

          <p>Khapseb, Shulacks have such shify eyes. They always look over their shoulders to make sure no one sees them plotting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How they can be related to the sweet Shugos, Kahrun only sees.</p>

          <p>Khapseb! Your Shugo interpretation is more than a little creepy, [%username], but I take your meaning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can work with all these pieces to turn out a perfect Shulack costume.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those furry menaces will never know about the Daeva in their midst.</p>

          <p> </p>
