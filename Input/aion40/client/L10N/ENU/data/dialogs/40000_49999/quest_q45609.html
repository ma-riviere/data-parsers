		<p>It feels like ages since I last felt the heat of battle...the sweet serenade of clanging blades...the wails of the wounded.</p>

		<p>That might make me sound wicked, but I'm sure a fellow Daeva would understand, right [%username]? I yearn for battle...but instead I get to hand out combat supplies. Not that handing out supplies doesn't bring eternal glory....</p>

		<p>It's admirable to see a Crusader acquire 30 marks. That [%mainslotitem] of yours must have have sealed the spirits of hundreds of Elyos Daevas. </p>

		<p>I suppose the one good thing in all of this is that this war may never end. In a few hundred years, I might get another chance to fight, instead of just handing out supplies....</p>
