          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have discovered a new class of Aether which is apparently only found in Balaurea. This [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45045a] is essential to our goals in the area, and we must gather as much as we can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Henceforth, travel to Balaurea and collect [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45045a]. When you have gathered a sufficient quantity, bring it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amphibia] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mollusca] for proper storage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>We have fewer active Wardens in Gelkmaros than any other place in Atreia. I suppose the duties here are more challenging, but that's only because they're so crucial to our cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those Wardens who are truly passionate about their job will certainly be duly rewarded, though.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Other Wardens have brought some, but we still need more for.... Well, for whatever. It's powerful. We just need it. That's all that should matter. Please see to this promptly.</p>

          <p>Ah, excellent. With this special Aether the Field Wardens will truly be able to use it for...the benefit of all Asmodae. Obviously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the specifics aren't important. What matters is your reward, right? Here you are!</p>
