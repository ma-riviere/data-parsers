          <p>The villagers tremble in fear because of those rampaging Leowasp Looters. Many are worried the monsters might even attack when everybody's asleep!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was told you always help people wherever you go, [%username]. Is that right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll speak plainly. Kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_DragonFly_57_An]s rampaging around [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_01]. I ask on behalf of the entire village.</p>
