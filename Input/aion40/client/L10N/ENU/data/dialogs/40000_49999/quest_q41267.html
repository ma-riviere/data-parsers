          <p>Looks like the bounty hunting is paying off in more ways than one. My superiors were so pleased at my initiative that they've approached me with a special mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They want me to infiltrate [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2] and plant a series of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41267a_bomb]s in flammable piles of [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_Firewood_Q41267] there. They hope to sow chaos among the Balaur--perhaps even kill a significant number in one strike. But I think I need help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've been there on my behalf; you know the terrain. Can you help me with the bomb-planting, for the good of Atreia?</p>

          <p>You're back. I thought I saw you in Satrakand, but I couldn't be sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I did, however, hear a lot more explosions than I planted bombs. So I knew you had to have been successful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to admit--I actually had fun with this one.</p>

          <p>Indeed. There's nothing quite like sowing discord and death among the Balaur, is there?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I can get a promotion, I'll be able to earn more money. Kinotia will get better that much sooner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it'll be all because of you! Siel bless your kindness!</p>

          <p>Jouvis got a mission to detonate bombs in Satrakand, and asked for your help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you took a Powerful Aether Bomb and detonated it there. The explosion, and the chaos it caused, was quite spectacular.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned to Jouvis, who also detonated bombs. He thanked you and remarked that the mission was kind of fun.</p>
