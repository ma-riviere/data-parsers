          <p>The success of the Field Wardens' mission in Gelkmaros is tied to success in the Silentera Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to properly launch the "Balaurea Aetheric Field Observatory Plan" we must coordinate our efforts with various Archons in that region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this time, we wish you to visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Krizarid] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3011_A], and deliver his message to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this phase of our mission, your confidence and discretion are of the utmost importance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of the Aion Tower go with you, Warden.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the Vorgaltem Citadel, [%username]. You're here on the business of the Field Wardens, right?</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I do. The Wardens wish to know more of the Silentera Canyon, but I know no more than I did before. The area can be accessed only when the fortresses are captured. The Wardens will need the support of the Archons at each fortress. More I cannot say.</p>
          <p> </p>       
          <p>Blood for blood, four for four. Tell them that is the code.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will send further details in a separate letter--for now, this message will suffice.</p>

          <p>The Silentera Canyon is a very sensitive area, and the Wardens are not the only group with a stake in the area. Needless to say, any work related to the Silentera Canyon must be...dealt with...very carefully.</p>
