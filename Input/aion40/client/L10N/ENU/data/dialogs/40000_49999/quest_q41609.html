          <p>This is not the only area that has to deal with danger, of course. Some of my colleagues are in bad shape.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My friends in Gurriki Swamp and the Siege Troop Garrison are in particular need. Some foes are giving more than their share of trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_Cellatu_Named_58_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuAs_Named_58_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Enos_Named_60_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Mammoth_Named_60_Ae], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_SiegeWeapon_Named_59_Ae].... Even their names sound dangerous, don't you think?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to help them, if I could. If we could kill just one of these creatures, we could free up much needed resources. Are you up to it?</p>

          <p>I've already heard from one of my colleagues who spotted you in her area.</p>

          <p>She didn't know who you were and was concerned, but, when I explained, she was very grateful. I assume you fulfilled my request?</p>

          <p>Taking pressure off one of us takes pressure off us all. Less need for reinforcements, less worry about a flank attack...</p>

          <p>Our problems may continue to grow, but even one solved is an excellent day's work, as far as I'm concerned.  One day at a time....</p>
