          <p>It's from Petrarca. "The Circle is not complete without you. Please see me at the Convent of Marchutan.".</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pretty interesting. The Circle was founded by Lord Marchutan himself. They help new Daevas in need of guidance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested, you should talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Petarca].</p>

          <p>Lord Marchutan has always been concerned with the development of new Daevas. They are often left to "sink or swim" on their own.</p>

          <p>The Circle guides and teaches young Daevas so that they may better walk destiny's path.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only would you be helping your fellow Daevas, and all of Pandaemonium, but rewards could be yours too. Think it over and let me know.</p>
