        <body>
          <p>Not long ago, it looked like Kamar was losing interest in Jotun research. But since you foreigners have arrived, there's been a new wave of interest in learning from other cultures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Nepilim_M1_58_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Nepilim_M2_58_Ae]s in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09] are quite... unwelcoming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard to study creatures that are trying to kill you. Please, could you bring some of your allies down there and subdue them?</p>

          <p>To be honest, the more I study the Jotun, the more I pity them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Reians are blessed with inquisitive, versatile minds, and clever imaginations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jotun lives are lived in endless, hive-minded toil. They've no curiosity, no diversity. It's a dull, meaningless existence.</p>

          <p>Hopefully that means it will be easier to get down there and study them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While they're rather boring themselves, their technology could turn out to be priceless.</p>

          <p>Yaci, a Jotun Researcher, was having trouble studying his subjects since they kept trying to kill him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went down into the Debarim Petralith Studio and subdued some Jotun there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you reported back to Yaci, he implied that you may be doing the Jotun a favor by ending their meaningless existence.</p>
