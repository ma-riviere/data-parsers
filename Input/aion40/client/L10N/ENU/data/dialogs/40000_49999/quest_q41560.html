          <p>You really want this Magical Aether Crystal? Truly? Because if you want it that badly, you'll have to earn it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here are my terms: every time you do a favor for me, I'll give you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ldf4b_questcomp_02]. Earn enough, and you get the Magical Aether Crystal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That way, you get what you need, I get respite from you for a while, and everyone else gets the benefit of dangerous missions getting done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See? Everybody wins! Think you can handle it? If not, I've got work to do that requires peace and quiet!</p>

          <p>By Siel, you do! I'd completely forgotten... I hadn't realized I'd been depending on you so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, then. There's nothing for it; a promise is a promise. Here's the Magical Aether Crystal. Use it wisely, young Daeva, or I'll be very cross.</p>
