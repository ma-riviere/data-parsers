          <p>Let's see.... I've got the vegetables, the spices....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! How silly of me! I need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41269A]! That's what gives the soup so much of its body and flavor! But I still can't leave my post right now; that's why I had you get the spines earlier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Drakanstrider_wild_58_An]s wandering nearby for me, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

          <p>You know, before I Ascended, I was seriously considering becoming a chef.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But after the Cataclysm, I felt obliged to lend my strength to my fellow Reians. But I still keep my cooking skills up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the rest of the soup is ready. All it needs is that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41269A].</p>

          <p>Indeed! All it needs now is a little cooking time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you so much for this. Kinotia will really love this. Though not as much as my good news, most likely.</p>

          <p>You hunted Territorial Pagatis and obtained their meat. Joubis was giddy with anticipation for Kinotia.</p>
