          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmodian forces in Gelkmaros are running low on supplies, and we have been asked to assist with their replenishment. We believe it is in our best interest to comply, as this will help us to maintain support from several key individuals upon whom we rely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are hereby asked to gather [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45046a], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45046b], and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45046c] to be used as food. Bring all that you gather to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amphibia] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mollusca], who will see to the redistribution effort.</p>
