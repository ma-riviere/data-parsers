          <p>The engineers who run the Aether Generator have hired us to hunt a snuffler they call Nimblestump.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Target: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DaQ_Merdion_DR_53]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Location: Near the Aether Generator in the Marayas Scrubland</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: It constantly gnaws on delicate parts. Already two engineers have had to go home to Pandaemonium with nervous breakdowns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our clients have set up a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FOBJ_Q46510] near Nimblestump's usual haunt to lure it. Rewards to those who take it down!</p>

          <p>A Snuffler? Is that really work for Charlirunerk's Daemons? Well, they paid us very well, so it must be!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, Snuffler must be easy to fight! Just pick it up like ball and throw it! Or stomp on it! WHAM!</p>
