          <p>(muttering to himself) Oh, no...certainly. I don't mind going the extra distance to please a customer. I'll just listen to any mindless request any heathen makes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not like I'm an expert in these sorts of things. If you want plaid, then yes! I'll get you plaid. I'll just nip over to Palentine's and borrow some. I'm sure she uses plenty.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>You seem like the oh-so-earnest type, so maybe--if you swear you'll do exactly what I tell you and not go out on your own--you might be able to help me with a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Daevas of Life have asked me to design their new uniforms. I was thrilled to be asked! A chance to exercise my abilities, to layer textures and pieces just so until they achieve the ultimate expression of magnificence!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the customers seem to think they should have some sort of input. They'll say things like "make the hemlines longer" and "does that come in octaside sobi" as though they had any idea what the slightest change could mean to the entire creation!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't bear to hear it. Will you pretend you have some modicum of experience? Just round up their opinions so that I may cry over their indignities upon the world of fashion before I begin my work.</p>

          <p>Well? What are you still doing here? Go meet the Daevas of Life and ask for their design suggestions for the new uniform.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, you don't have to meet all of them. Do you think that in the thousands of years I've been designing that I have seen every customer who might someday wear a particular uniform? Would you expect a chef in a large restaurant to gather feedback from every diner, every day, every meal?</p>

          <p>I suggest you seek out [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Deurone], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Seora], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erone]. I'll leave you to it then.</p>

          <p>No? Somehow I'm not surprised. I knew when you first asked to work for me that you were a snivelling, talentless wretch. I didn't think, however, that you had no sense of determination.</p>
