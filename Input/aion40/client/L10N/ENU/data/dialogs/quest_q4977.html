          <p>Finally! My work with Balaur energies is finally gaining the official recognition it deserves!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems that there is a lot of Drana production in Balaurea, which in turn has increased interest in its effects on Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been officially charged with researching both worlds, and how Drana is both created and used. This is very exciting.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Still, this means that my work has really only just begun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm confronted with an interesting dilemma: I want more Drana energy produced so I can study it. Yet letting that happen also helps the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps we can sever the connection between those two factors by killing the largest creatures and devices that harvest and use Drana. Would you help me do that?</p>

          <p>Excellent! There are several major targets to chose from. The first are the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem1_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem3_50_Ah] of Lake Maravata. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then there are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_F_Spaller_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_STR_IDLF1_F_Spaller2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_STR_IDLF1_F_Spaller3_50_Ah] in the Drana Fields.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, there are the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_BionicCPU_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator1_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator3_50_Ah] in Timolia Mine. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are all dangerous, heavily guarded, or both. But they use most of the Drana in Dark Poeta, so their destruction would serve my purpose...and that of Asmodae.</p>

          <p>I've told you that I'm not experienced in combat, to say the least, haven't I?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is the only way I can get this done: hiring a Daeva to go to Dark Poeta in my stead. I certainly can't do it myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is not to say that it can't get done without you. You're not the most important Daeva in Atreia. But it's just...unfortunate.</p>

          <p>My work is proceeding apace. Now all I need is more Drana from Dark Poeta to work with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it's a possible future, the Drana has had much time to strengthen and change. That makes it absolutely vital to my studies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So will I have my samples? Has Drana use in Dark Poeta been sufficiently diminished?</p>

          <p>Good. Not only will this make more Drana available to me, it will also keep the Balaur from making things worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or will it? Dark Poeta is a possible future, after all. Can we in its past affect what, to Dark Poeta, has already occurred?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bah, it gives me a headache. Temporal logic is not my field. At any rate, please take this as your payment.</p>

          <p>Hnoss gained official recognition for her work. However, she needed more Drana from Dark Poeta to study, and asked you to destroy the Balaur creations that use up the most of her potential samples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you got destroyed particularly powerful Marabatas, Spallers, and Generators. Hnoss thanked you, grateful for your aid in her research</p>
