          <p>This will be brief. I'm pressed for time, so please listen carefully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kysis Fortress, like the Krotan and Miren Fortresses, is a vital strategic point. It guards the entrance to the Eye of Reshanta, so the enemy mustn't keep it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A full-scale offensive is impractical due to our losses during the previous battle.</p>

          <p>To buy time to raise reinforcements, we're infiltrating enemy territory to conduct raids.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The idea is to bleed enemy strength by attacking guards outside the fortress when they're isolated. Preserve our troops, inflict losses on the enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're lucky to have many Elyos Daevas lending their swords to the effort. How about you, [%username]? Are you also willing?</p>

          <p>Thank you. I commend your bravery.</p>

          <p>I'm marshaling the Protector of Teminon Legion to retake the fortress. Gather a squad and go to Kysis Fortress. Hunt down any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Decasys_Guard] soldiers you can find inside the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Oh, and don't go alone. This is about inflicting losses without taking them. Don't play fair.</p>

          <p>You decimated the fortress garrison and returned to Bellona. Her scouts had reported of your victory, and she commended your success. </p>
