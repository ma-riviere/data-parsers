          <p>The Poya Jungle is a dangerous place, but the Frillnecks are the worst part. I started having nightmares about them as soon as I got here!</p>

          <p>You should avoid them at all costs! I only wish I had that luxury.</p>

          <p>Until now I could, but those safe days are over! The Frillnecks here are four times the size of those in other places.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've been getting bigger since we started studying them too, which is probably why Senea is so interested in them. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She asked me to collect fluid samples from the Frillnecks. I don't know how I'm going to do it without getting killed.</p>

          <p>Senea has asked me to hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FrillfaimamBaby1st_37_An]s. Cells from the younger ones divide quite quickly so it's easier for her to cultivate them.</p>
