          <p>I've come up with a solution of sorts. There are a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonRe_33_An]s around here, and I've been told their horns are very popular as decorations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can get them, I'll sell them to the Shugos and we'll split the profit.</p>
