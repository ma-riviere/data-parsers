          <p>Did you know that Spriggs are omnivorous? Sure, we eat grains and fruits, but we also love meat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really appreciate the grain sacks, but if you don't have to rush away, I'll ask one more favor.</p>

          <p>Will you get me some Granker meat? I know Humans and Daevas don't like Granker meat--it has a foul odor to you--but Spriggs just love it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not just for me. You see, I've been away from my tribe for a while now, so when I go back I'd like to bring an offering.</p>

          <p>If I bring granker meat, what a celebration there'll be! Will you hunt Grankers for me, [%username]?</p>
