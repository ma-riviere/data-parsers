          <p>Yadamonerk has thought hard on this, and is sure that he is the one sending Kerubar to the excavation site.</p>

          <p>Not hard at all for Gestanerk--he could talk to Kerubar! </p>

          <p>Always he sent them to fight somewhere else, and then picked up relics easily. Very good system, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps too good, Nyerk. One day, he told us he would take the half of relics he finds from then on for himself!</p>

          <p>Yadamonerk is ashamed at such behavior from a Shugo. Not only is it selfish, but also against Union rules!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One or two extra relics is easy to...ignore. But half is too many. Gestanerk disappeared that night, and Kerubar arrived soon after.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How can a Shugo betray other Shugos like this! He must be stopped, Daeva. Will you help the Excavation Union?</p>
