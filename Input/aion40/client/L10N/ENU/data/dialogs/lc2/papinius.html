          <p>Arieluma! Stigma is an amazing stone. Its mysterious power to awaken abilities within us makes it so valuable. Well, that and the fact that it's beautiful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I love this stuff!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I present my Stigma to Daevas who fight valiantly in the Abyss. For the honor of Elyos!</p>

          <p>Apologies, my friend, but Stigma is only awarded to Daevas who've proven themselves in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot give them away for any amount of Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want a Stigma stone, you only have one option: Go to the Abyss. Win battles. Earn some glory and honor for all of Elyos!</p>
