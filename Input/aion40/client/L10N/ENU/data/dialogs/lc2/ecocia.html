          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I've heard about your triumphs in the Abyss. You're sure doing Elyos proud!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't compete with your skills...I mean, sheesh, you earned a Reward for Contribution! Nice!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best I can do is show you this great selection of resplendent Stigma. Just got these babies in last week and they're going like Solorius Cake.</p>

          <p>Any qualified Daeva can go to the Abyss, but not many manage to make a good enough showing to earn a Reward for Contribution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're not eligible for that reward yet, [%username], but I will gladly present it to you once you've acquired enough experience.</p>
