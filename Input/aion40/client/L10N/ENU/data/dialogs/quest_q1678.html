          <p>The admiral is disheartened by the loss of the ship. We also lost a number of comrades to Vanishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there's no point in dwelling on the past. We must attain our goal, if only to avenge the loss of our Vanished comrades.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must vanquish Bollvig!</p>

          <p>Along with the ship we lost needed supplies. There's not enough food to go around--precisely when need our strength the most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had a look around here and saw many Esosas in the sea surrounding the village. A few of those, and the crew would take heart...</p>

          <p>It may seem beneath your talents, but would you catch some [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_fish_n_c_40a]s so we might regain some strength and spirit?</p>

          <p>Anyone who spends time on the seas knows that [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_fish_n_c_40a] is superior food, pound-for-pound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not just high in nutrition--it tastes good roasted, steamed, or even dried into jerky. You could call it the best fish there is, and you wouldn't be wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are plenty in the waters near the village, and you can also find them in the Puitonen Bogs, the Nolantis Relics, and the Stenon Bay.</p>

          <p>The Esosa holds a special meaning for the crew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once, after a battle, we ran into a storm that almost sank our ship. Like now, we were out of food, until a school of Esosa swam past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just a few Esosa, and I just know we'll be better for it.</p>

          <p>These are perfect for roasting. Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the crew gets a taste of these, they'll remember what it's like to feel strong again.</p>
