          <p> </p>
          <p>From the Shugo traders, I've heard of something called Shugo Express Mail. Have you ever used it? It's rather expensive, but letters can be delivered anywhere you want. Anywhere at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've written some letters.... I have the Kinah to send them, but I'm not exactly sure how to do it.</p>

          <p>The Shugo--he said he was going to a place called Traders' Berth. Then he said "nyerk." I don't know why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go there, will you take this to the Shugo for me? If it takes a while, I don't mind.</p>

          <p>There'll be some Kinah left over for your trouble as well.</p>
