          <p>[%username], I'm disappointed in how our efforts against the Black Claw Tribe have gone so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Azphel once cautioned his soldiers to strike at the enemy's root, not its branches. So far your efforts have pruned back many branches, but the tree itself--the Black Claw Tribe, if you're following me--remains as healthy as ever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready to strike at the root for a change, [%userclass]?</p>

          <p>My subordinates have failed to provide me with useful intelligence, but I've pieced together the Mau goal: open an Abyss Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first clue was the refined Odella they were stockpiling--Odella is useful for manipulating Aether and powering a gate-opening ritual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The second clue was Zemurru. The Mau started to venerate Zemurru because he is buried near an ancient portal that could be redirected to the Abyss. They must be trying to bring the Balaur to Asmodae.</p>

        	<p>Yes, I'm sure...not that you have any credibility to be second-guessing your superiors. You do have credibility when it comes to closing Abyss Gates, though--or so I'm told.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>For better or for worse, you're the best soldier for this job </p>

          <p>If you're ready, I'll <font color="B00000">teleport</font> you to Zemurru's Grave near the Abyss Gate. It's inside a huge tree. It is imperative that you destroy the gate. Got it?</p>

          <p>Just as I surmised. The Mau were trying to summon the Balaur to Asmodae. I think we just saved Asmodae from a full-fledged Balaur invasion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will report our success to Kvasir in Pandaemonium. And take note, Meiyer...I expect all my soldiers to deliver results like [%username] just did.</p>
