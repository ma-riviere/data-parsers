          <p>It's quite simple, [%username]. To help me, you'll need to wipe up Water Spirits along Fall Road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The task may not be as easy as you'd think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Water Spirits move in groups, so if you let down your guard for even a moment you'll find yourself surrounded.</p>

          <p>Correct. Three types of Water Spirits lurk on Fall Road; [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater2D_35_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater3D_36_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater4D_37_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lake Spirits are stronger than Water Spirits, and Mist Spirits are stronger than Lake Spirits. So you have to be careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill all three kinds, and bring their Elemental Stones as evidence, [%username].</p>

          <p>Each type of Water Spirit carries a different kind of Elemental Stone. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2413a]s from the Water Spirits, two [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2413b]s from Lake Spirits and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2413c] from a Water Mist Spirit.</p>
