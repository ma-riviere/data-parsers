          <p>Alas Daeva, there are no easy missions for those who wear the flower of the Red Hasia Legion. With so much at stake, we cannot spare you.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have proven again that you are worthy of your wings. Thanks to you, [%username], Asmodae has gained ground in Reshanta.</p>

          <p>Now comes the last and most difficult mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must find and eradicate [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade1]s. Rank 1 Soldiers are made up of the most experienced troops. They're battle hardened, yet they are not impervious to pain or destruction. It won't be easy. But it never is, eh?</p>
