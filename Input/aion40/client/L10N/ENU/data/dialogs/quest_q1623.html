          <p>What do you want? I've got nothing for you right now. Admiral Gorgos is breathing down my neck, and I'm just that annoyed right now. I've no need to run afoul of Gorgos, and it wouldn't take much to do it these days. </p>

          <p>How many days do you have? It would take that long to cover it all, and no mistake. The biggest thing, though, is supplies--or lack of them. </p>

          <p>The fleet couldn't anchor in Stenon Bay due to the rocks and shallow water, so we had to anchor the fleet to the northeast instead. We loaded most of our supplies into a smaller ship to be brought into the bay, but the currents here are fierce and capsized the ship.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>No one was hurt, but we lost more than half our supplies. </p>

          <p>What do you think we've been trying to do all this time? The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_SupplyBox_Q1623] went ashore somewhere, but we can't find it. We've collected what we can from the village, but it won't feed and supply an army. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Weapons, armor, and potions are all in short supply. I'm only one man, aye? I can't just whistle it up on the next strong wind.</p>

          <p>Hey, that's an idea. You've a strong back and a keen eye...help me find the lost [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1623a]. If you can, it'll tide us over until another shipment can arrive. </p>

          <p>Ah, thanks, [%username]. Anything that keeps my head off a ship's prow is most welcome. It should be on the coast somewhere around the village. Find the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_SupplyBox_Q1623] and bring me 3 sets of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1623a] in good condition.</p>

          <p>[%username], any luck? While you searched for supplies, I went to get potions. A Shugo merchant just "dropped" by with a pack-full to sell--more like ran his fuzzy ears over as fast as he could, but no matter.  
          	</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got the potions dealt with in any case. Weapons and armor, though, we're still that short on. Did you find any of the supplies we need? </p>
