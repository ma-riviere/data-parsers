          <p>Ulmus trees used to be quite common around here. Perhaps the Maeki or Spiners are eating them? Or they may have gotten a disease. I suppose that's why you're having a hard time finding them.</p>

          <p>Arkel is a Daeva who guards a remote village. She was worried that the residents might get attacked by fierce animals.</p>

          <p>She set up signposts at dangerous spots, but the wood was poor and they rotted away easily.</p>
