          <p>After examining the designs in Jaiorunerk's diary, Yiemyerk became frustrated that he could not create a 100-slot cube without further information on the Vindachinerk Standard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With Jaiorunerk already dead, Vindachinerk himself would be the only person in the world with that knowledge. Yiemyerk gave you the name of a Shugo who might know Vindachinerk's location, Numonerk, in Verteron Citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Numonerk was sure that Vindachinerk was not in Elysea and suggested that you meet Yadamonerk in Theobomos, a haunt for criminals. Yadamonerk nervously told you he hadn't seen any Shugos outside his own party, so you went to Reshanta to meet Garkbinerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you told Garkbinerk that Numonerk sent you, she revealed that she knew Vindachinerk's whereabouts.</p>
