		<p>Speak quickly, friend. Brusthonin's condition may be improving, but there is still plenty to do.</p>

		<p>A Daeva of taste, I see.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>A powerful weapon is a great aid, my friend. I've owed my life to my spell book more times than I care to remember, and not even I can count myself lucky enough to wield something as grand as the weapon you want.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>However, the weapon cannot be given for free. You must first hand me 2000 Platinum Coins.</p>
