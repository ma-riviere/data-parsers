          <p> </p>
          <p>Cheorunerk and his wife Caochenrinerk come from there. Three years now in this place, still can smell it!</p>

          <p>Dokurunerk. Always yelling, sending her to gather in the Medeus Manor. Bad place--worse shugo.</p>

          <p>When Cheorunerk declared his love, time was right to live in a different place. Marriage happened as soon as we arrived here.</p>

          <p>Shugos who break contracts always have problems--have had many since leaving Arbolu's Haven.</p>

          <p>Cheorunerk never complains--the love of Caochenrinerk is his greatest treasure. But he would have liked to give a pretty ring for the wedding, nyerk </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Three years of happy times, but not much Kinah. There is a special plan for anniversary present, but needs work. Is Daeva interested in helping?</p>

          <p>Handicraft master Utsida heard Cheorunerk's story, and wants to make beautiful necklace. Says no charge for crafting, only needs materials!</p>

          <p>If Daeva brings the materials and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_as_material_n_r_43b] to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Utisda], Caochenrinerk's smile will melt all of Bel...a very cold place!</p>
