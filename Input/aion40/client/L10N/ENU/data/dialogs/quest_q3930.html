          <p>You have perfect timing. I've been looking for a Daeva I can trust, and I know you've got a strong sense of justice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so long ago, the Guardians took me in for questioning. Apparently I'd been accused of having dirty dealings with the Shulacks.</p>

          <p>It seems they've been using the power of Stigma. Since I'm the preeminent Stigma Master in Sanctum, someone thought I might have some connection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Naturally I was exonerated, but I had to wonder where they heard these rumors. It seems [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Xenophon] brought up the idea.</p>
          <p> </p>
