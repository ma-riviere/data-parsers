          <p>Of course, you're used to traveling. This is all new for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last year, Veien asked me to go to the city with him to make our fortunes. We've been all over since then, but the whole fortune thing? Never happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this point, I just want to survive. Veien said joining the Vigilantes of the Settlers Campsite was a good chance to earn some money. But Kinah...well, everything's pretty scarce here.</p>
