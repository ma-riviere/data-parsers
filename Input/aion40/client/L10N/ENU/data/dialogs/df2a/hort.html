          <p>I used to teach theology in Pandaemonium. It was an honor but not the service I hoped to do.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I feared my claws would get too soft if not tested. When I heard about the Brusthonin recovery mission, my prayers were answered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here I've found a place that needs my devotion and I can make a real difference to heal Brusthonin.</p>   </body>
