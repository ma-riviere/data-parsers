          <p>Introduction</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohums: venerable, alien, noble, mysterious. Wise but fierce and wild, they yield to neither Balaur nor Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their ability to heal and purify, to surmount the contaminating power of the Balaur, has profound implications at a time when modern Asmodae faces monumental challenges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As noble values fade and land contamination steadily worsens, the Brohums imply answers to our most pressing questions.</p>

          <p> 1. Brohum Anatomy, Appearance, and Intelligence</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although Brohums appear to be half Human and half Trico, this comparison is inaccurate. They are in fact whole creatures, naturally born of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The upper body of a Brohum looks Human, but both male and female sport curled horns, long ears, and sleek Trico-like noses. Their arms and upper torsos are powerfully built.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The lower body resembles a Trico, with four thickly-muscled legs, stout tails, and swirled coat markings. They run fast and tirelessly even on rough or steep terrain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like Humans, they are highly intelligent, with their own language and culture. Their weapons are well crafted. Some literate Brohums write books.</p>

          <p>2. Brohum Habitat</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the past, Brohums were found everywhere in Atreia. Then as now, they preferred brightly lit mountains and plains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The war and contamination, however, killed or displaced many Brohums. Now they live in isolated places such as Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because Brohums are hunters and gatherers, they prefer habitats with reliable prey populations and lush, fruiting vegetation--rare at this writing.</p>

          <p>3. Brohum Life</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohums are generally healthier and longer-lived than Humans. They are especially resistant to poison or contamination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like Humans, Brohums breed in private. Young Brohums are rarely seen.</p>

          <p>Brohums hunt and gather their sustenance. Both sexes excel at these skills. They do not cultivate or raise livestock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohums use weapons only when hunting or defending their safety and territory. Their favorite weapons are wooden bows and spears. They have yet to develop armor.</p>

          <p>Brohums adapt readily to many environments. While they don't build artificial shelter, they may build round structures of woven grass, twigs, and moss to store items or mark territory. These structures may also be used as nurseries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohums do not wear clothes; warm fur covers their lower torsos. They do, however, adorn themselves with elaborate accessories made from plants.</p>

          <p> 3. Brohum Culture, Religion, and Literacy</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohum culture revolves around Aion worship, with roots that stretch back before the Cataclysm. The religion is not systematized, though a High Priest presides over religious services.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As part of religious observance, Brohums craft sturdy decorative weapons from soft plant stalks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Beautiful, intricate, and unique to each Brohum, the 'worship weapon' is acknowledged throughout Brusthonin as a distinctive work of art, coveted by Humans and Skurvs.</p>

           <p>The Brohum language is fairly well developed but only older, wiser Brohums read and write. Some Brohums even learn to speak Human languages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Brohum alphabet consists of primitive yet beautiful pictograms. Irregular grammar makes text interpretation difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Literate Brohums publish books by writing on big, sturdy leaves and binding them together. Books are stored in Brohum grass shelters and are considered precious.</p>

        <p> 4. The Brohum Mystery</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is commonly thought that Brohums live only in uncontaminated regions. Strictly speaking, however, they do not look for clean habitats.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brohums can permanently purify their environment, encouraging the return of plants to formerly fouled soil no matter how thoroughly it is poisoned. No one knows the source of this ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ginseng flourishes in Brohum lands, as do Grobule and Green Dionae, creating breathtaking landscapes among tall green trees and soft-grassed hills.</p>

          <p>Conclusion</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The continued study of Brohums remains a priority during restoration of Brusthonin and beyond. Though their purifying ability went unnoticed before contamination set in, today its relevance cannot be ignored. Brohums could completely rehabilitate Brusthonin's fertile landscape.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recognition of this basic truth is vital. We must not only co-exist with the Brohums, but create alliances that benefit the land and its creatures. Such alliances will inevitably benefit us.</p>
