           <p>Greetings, Daeva.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Are you looking for rare materials? I have a wide assortment, but only a limited supply of each. They're very popular, and not everyone sells these.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>If you don't plan to buy anything, please move aside. There are other customers, you understand.</p>
