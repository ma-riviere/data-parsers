          <p>Blast! That's the third time I've been caught in that same trap!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd think I would have learned...but I need to get to Mosqua's Nest, regardless of how much these blasted insects want to stop me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look like a [%userclass].... Hmmmm...we could work together to get to Mosqua's Nest. I'll even keep these wicked insects off your back. What do you say? </p>

          <p>There's no need for hesitation. We'll be much safer if we go together.</p>

          <p>I'm a Templar. I can keep these insects away from you, and dish out some damage as well. Just think of me as your own personal meatshield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came here because I heard that Queen Mosqua carried a rare item...one I wanted to get my hands on. But I'm not selfish. You saved my life, so you can have it. Let's just get it together.</p>
