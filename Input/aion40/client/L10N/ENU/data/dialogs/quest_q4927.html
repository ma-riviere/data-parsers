          <p>Divine Power skills are special abilities that Aion has granted to Daevas. But because they're rarely used, even some veterans are rather inexperienced with them..</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Divine Power Test is an incentive proposed by the Governor to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call it a test, but it's really more of a training session. It ends when you use a chosen skill ten times. What do you think? Would you like to give it a go?</p>

          <p>You are a Spiritmaster, did you say? Then you should have learned the Disenchant skill recently.</p>

          <p>That skill will be subject of your Divine Power Test. Return to me once you've used [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DP_El] ten times.</p>
