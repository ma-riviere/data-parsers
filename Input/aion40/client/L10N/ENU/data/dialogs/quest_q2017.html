          <p>Thanks for coming, [%username]. I'm afraid to leave the observatory!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our research on the Aetheric Field is crucial. The more we learn, the better our chances of stopping Aether--and eventually all life--from leaking out of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why would anyone want to attack us? Don't they understand that we're trying to save everyone?</p>

          <p>The Lepharist Revolutionaries, of course. They creep close at night, digging holes and measuring the distances among them. Every night, they get a little closer to the Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lepharists think we're unaware of them, but I spend every waking hour in an observatory. My job requires me to be...well, observant.</p>

          <p>We need to foil their plans, [%username]. But I'm a sage, not a strategist or a soldier. </p>

          <p>The direct approach will at least buy us time and keep the observatory safe. [%username], go to the Lepharist campsite down Calderon Hill and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparWaD_17_An]s.</p>
