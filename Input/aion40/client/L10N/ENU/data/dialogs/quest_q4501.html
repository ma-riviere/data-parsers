          <p>I like to restock my goods before they're in danger of running out. It increases my credibility with my customers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Customers expect what they want to be available now, not in some unknowable future, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I placed an order for Tripeed fruits well before I would have run out.</p>

          <p>But the delivery date has passed, and my stock's getting dangerously low. If I should run out...well, I can scarcely imagine the consequences.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or I can, actually. Disappointed customers refusing to shop here...going over to Shugo merchants....</p>

          <p>But it wouldn't be a problem if I could hire someone to pick up the Tripeed Fruit Box from Alsig Village in Morheim, and bring it back here.</p>

          <p>I can't do it myself--I've got no one else to look after the shop. And of course when you can't fly, the trip's a lot longer.</p>
