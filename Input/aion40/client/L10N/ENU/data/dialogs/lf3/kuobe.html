          <p>Devotion is great. Devotion to study is good. Risking one's life in devotion to study--I can even understand that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But--beat me with Nezekan's shield--one shouldn't risk or burden others for one's passion!</p>

          <p>The duty of a real Guardian is to protect residents from danger, not to babysit a scholar.</p>

          <p>I wouldn't complain if I was doing something important, like guarding against Lepharists attacks.</p>
