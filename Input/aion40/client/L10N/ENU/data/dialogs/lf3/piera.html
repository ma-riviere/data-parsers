          <p>When I first came here with Senea I thought I would have plenty of time to scout for information, but I was wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I barely have time for sleep, let alone reconnaissance, because I spend all my time keeping these scientists out of trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why don't they send enough Garrison troops to do the menial guard work? Honestly it's beneath a highly-trained Daeva of Zephyr.</p>

          <p>Sorry, but I'm not allowed to talk about it. I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you. But you'd resurrect, so I just can't tell you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even we Daevas of Zephyr don't know who collects what information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a precaution to prevent important information from being leaked if one of us is captured by Krall or Asmodians.</p>
