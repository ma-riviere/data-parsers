          <p>How do you do, Daeva? I'm not a priest of this fortress, if that's what you're looking for. I was in the Calm Village originally, but I came here to assist Sofne.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sofne doesn't know much about the situation in Heiron, so I provide her with as much information as I can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only hope I don't forget anything important....</p>
