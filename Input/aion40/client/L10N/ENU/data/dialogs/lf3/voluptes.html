          <p>Admiral Gorgos didn't used to be as nervous as he is these days, but the stress of running the unit under such threatening circumstances, with few supplies...well, it's getting to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We came to kill the undead and take care of Bollvig, but we've not made much progress. It's not his fault, but the Admiral takes this sort of thing personally.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>I try to take care of the smaller problems in order to lessen his burden.</p>
