          <p>After graduation from the Temple, my best friend Quid suggested we to join a reputed Legion. He said it would be more exciting than a stifling life as a Guardian.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, we joined the Blue Fleet and got more excitement than either of us bargained for. Quid was Vanished by Bollvig in our last combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've...the war has never been so personal before. I wish we had stayed in Sanctum.</p>
