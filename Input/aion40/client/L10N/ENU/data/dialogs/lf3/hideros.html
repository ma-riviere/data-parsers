          <p>[%username], have you seen the most beautiful woman in Atreia? Some say it's a Guardian called Altiana in the fortress, but I know the truth....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is Aifemis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She is not only beautiful, but also good-humored and kind to everyone. It's her only flaw!</p>

          <p>She smiles always, just because she is kind. But men often misunderstand, believing that she favors them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do my best, but can't keep them all away. I'd have to stand here all day long!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter what happens, I will do my best to protect Aifemis.</p>
