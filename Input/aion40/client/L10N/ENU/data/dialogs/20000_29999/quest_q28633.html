          <p>Did I just see you thinking about wearing Kromede's Flame as a necklace?</p>

          <p>Only an Elmo would do that! Kromede's Flame is meant to be used to improve the Greatsword of the Judge.</p>

          <p>Yes. There are three things you need to reinforce the Greatsword of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need Kromede's Flame, the Greatsword of the Judge, and a talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can provide the smithing part, if you can get the Greatsword of the Judge. Interested?</p>

          <p>I'd say you made a wise choice, but there's really no choice to make, is there?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple of Morheim has the Greatsword of the Judge.</p> 
          <p> </p>	
          <p>Maybe that's a good place to start looking.</p>

          <p>Don't weep for Kromede.... She's been taken over by grief and hate. She doesn't deserve your compassion anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she's gone, and you're here. Give the greatsword here, along with Kromede's Flame, and then step back. No, further.</p>

          <p>Greatswords are pretty much all I work with these days. I'm confident I can handle this one, especially when Kromede's Flame is involved!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just head back to me when you have the greatsword and Kromede's Flame in your Cube, and I'll show you.</p>
