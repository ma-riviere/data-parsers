          <p>I saw Mastarius come out to meet you personally. You must be the one Empyrean Lord Marchutan mentioned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He foresaw a long time ago what would happen today, and prepared for it--this fortress, Lumiel's Quartz, the Fatebound Legion...and now it seems...well....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracle of Prophecy said one who could defeat Tiamat would show up when the Dredgion appeared in Gelkmaros. The Dredgion arrived not long ago, and here you are. Just in time.</p>

          <p>Lord Marchutan said the Dredgion contained at least one of Siel's Relics, so at his command I ordered the Fatebound Legion to shoot it down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you might expect, we are now looking for the relic in the wreckage. Perhaps you will assist us in this effort? Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Barretta] will fill you in.</p>

          <p>Richelle mentioned you'd be coming. Some, Richelle among them, believe you're the one the prophecy mentions, but I must admit I'm not sure yet.</p>

          <p>It's not me you have to prove yourself to, of course--it's Lord Marchutan.</p>

          <p>I've split our forces into two groups--one of which is chasing runaway Balaur--but I'm afraid they're at a loss where to begin. Your help would be appreciated, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Even without looking, I can tell you that I sense Lady Siel's energy--but only slightly. The relic may have been kept near these items, but it is not here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps searching by hand is not the best way to do this. There is a Watching Eye developed by the Research Center that can quickly scan the entire area.</p>

          <p>I'll inform Brigade General Valetta of your next move--you must head to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC2] and meet preceptor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ehate] to get the Watching Eye.</p>
