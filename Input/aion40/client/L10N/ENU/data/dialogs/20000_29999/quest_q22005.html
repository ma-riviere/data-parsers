          <p>Ah, finally, an Asmodian! Those haughty Elyos have been ignoring me all day! I hope you'll help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_MutantBeast_58_An]s? I mean... have you seen them?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're the stuff of nightmares! All muscle and teeth, prowling around with those beady eyes and... and what are those things sticking out of their backs?! Horns? Bones?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For Siel's sake, go and kill them for us? We're supposed to be monitoring Tiamat, but none of us can concentrate with those things around.</p>
