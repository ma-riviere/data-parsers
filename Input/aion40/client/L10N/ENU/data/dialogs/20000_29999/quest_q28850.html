          <p>You have Ancient Crown, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know Daeva is probably thinking I do this for trade, but is very important part of apprenticeship, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have always had great interest in archaeology. Great archaeologist says, if I collect enough relics, will get an apprenticeship. And is much more convenient for Daevas, besides, not having to go all the way to Abyss to exchange crowns.</p>

          <p>Yes, these are quite low quality, in expert opinion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still valuable, still interesting, just not quite as good a reward. Daeva understands?</p>

          <p>Yes, shiny. Decent Ancient Crowns, these.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not museum pieces, but very respectable.</p>

          <p>Really? Greater Ancient Crowns? Never seen ten of them together in same place before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will take these to great archaeologist, win much favor!</p>

          <p>Oh! So beautiful! Have heard of treasures like these, but never thought I'd hold one in my hand!</p>

          <p>Just think how many hundreds of years old... thousands?</p>

          <p>Don't see any crowns in cube. Food that might be interesting to archaeologist, akakak, but no crowns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Goblets go to colleage over there. Other relics to Shugos in Abyss. Bring crowns to me.</p>
