        <body>
          <p>I've received interesting news. It seems that Kahrun's ban on hostilities between us and the Elyos doesn't extend to Balaur Legion Garrisons around Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must take advantage of this. The Elyos certainly will. We must strike at them in these places before they strike at us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's Will doesn't extend to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_A4], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_A4], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T4_A3], and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C3]. If that sounds a bit daunting, you might try [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C1_A2], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C1], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C2_S6], or [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C2_A1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't let the Reians know about this, or we'll have more trouble than we can handle.</p>

          <p>I feel that we will have peace between us and Elyos someday... when they admit their wrongs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But for now, we fight when we can. Were the reports about the garrisons accurate?</p>

          <p>Excellent. This knowledge won't be secret for long, so we must take full advantage while we are able.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we press hard enough, the Elyos will never be able to dislodge us once we beat Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Heh, even under Kahrun's eye, our war continues.... I wonder if that's meaningful. Anyway, good job.</p>

          <p>Gidon told you to kill Elyos in places where Kahrun's Will is ineffective, so that Asmodae could gain advantage when Tiamat is defeated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed the Elyos that you could find in Tiamaranta, and returned to high praises.</p>
