          <p>Once we were all as one. A natural...harmonious...symbiotic entity. Perfect. Now we are at war.</p>

          <p>They have been driven...mad by the Aether. Their lust for it drives them...into a frenzy. They...drill into my body...desperate to tap into my sap...for just a sip...just one sip...of the Aether in me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All the insects are mad, but the worst...their names are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_1F_Sheluk_KeyNM_52_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_1F_Clodworm_ItemNM_52_Ae], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_Octaside_KeyNM_52_Ae].</p>

          <p>Now...listen closely. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_1F_Sheluk_KeyNM_52_Ae] has a...magic stone within it that grants it incredible strength.</p>
