          <p>The real mission here is to defeat Tiamat's legions, though sticking a knife through an Ellie or two would be nice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've no doubt that the battle will turn against the Elyos soon. They're too proud to see how the Reians resent their pompous posturing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When things start to happen, I want the Reians to think we're their reliable old pals. I need you to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_tiamat_banner_01]s as proof of the Balaur we've thrashed. Go take them off of the Legions in Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>
