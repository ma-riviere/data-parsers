		<p>Will give stronger rewards meant for stronger Daevas the more coins you give!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Oh! Also, rewards only for Gladiator, Templar, Assassin, or Ranger. If you use magic, go away!</p>

		<p>Let's see.... Yes, you've brought me four coins!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Here, I hope this is useful! If not, you should collect more coins and become stronger!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Still, to even get this many coins means you are well on way to becoming that strong! Good job!</p>

		<p>My, that is a lot of coins! Not many Daevas bring in seven.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If my reward not to liking, might want to become stronger, get more experience in battle. Then will be able to get better reward!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But this stuff will come in handy anyway! Think of me when you use in battle against Balaur, eh?</p>

		<p>Oh! Really? When I said I would give many rewards for ten silver coins, did not expect to be taken up on offer!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>To have that many means you must be very powerful! You should be able to use this top notch reward!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Whew, was wondering if anyone would ever collect this reward! Nice!</p>
