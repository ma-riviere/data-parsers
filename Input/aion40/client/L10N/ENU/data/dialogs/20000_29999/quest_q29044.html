          <p>Hey, [%username], what do you think of my pet crew today? Arn't they great?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, pets are just like people. They're happiest when they feel needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have a pet, make sure that you show you care. It's totally worth it.</p>

          <p>You need to make sure to pay a lot of attention to your pet. You know, give it snuggles, tickle it behind the ears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why, just this morning my Aukwi was looking a bit depressed, so I hunkered down for a long chat and a snuggle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some obnoxious guy made fun of me, but what does he know? Pets like to communicate. His loss if he's too dim to listen.</p>

          <p>I've heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Katin] is really knowledgeable about pets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're as obsessed with pets as I am, go talk to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to talk to him myself, but I'm pet sitting for this crew right now, so no time. But let me know if you learn anyting interesting, huh?</p>

          <p>Silke sent you? Ah, she's a sweet one. And so good with pets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me? I think the best advice I can give you is to never take them for granted. You need to pay attention to them, form a bond, learn to recognize their moods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, don't just recognize their moods, respond to them. If you see that your pet is sad, snuggle it, or groom it or something. Don't just leave it there, wallowing in sorrow. That's just cruel.</p>

          <p>Of course not, and I'm sure you'd never neglect a pet. You seem quite observant, and I doubt that you'll have any troubles keeping tabs on your pet's emotional and physical health.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might be interested in this book I've been reading. A fascinating treatise on pet grooming. Such a perfect bonding opportunity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take the book. I think you'll like it. Perhaps we can have a book club discussion about it next week....</p>
