          <p>When our forces first arrived, some legionaries decided to make a game out of hunting creatures in Enos Forest to keep their skills up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that Kahrun's Will has weakened in that area, the games must be stopped. Too many Daevas are being attacked by the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, this also means that the local wildlife count there will go up with fewer Daevas hunting them. That too would be dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take up where the legionaries left off, and get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Enos_59_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Enos_Baby_59_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Fethlot_59_An]es.</p>

          <p>The Daevas participating in the Enos Forest games would contribute to a pool, to be won by the one who killed the most creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may not be playing, or going for a large purse, but I assure you that you will be well-rewarded for your efforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, that assumes that you have done what I asked you to do.</p>

          <p>Good. We need to be vigilant when it comes to that area from now on, thanks to Kahrun's Will weakening.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if Tiamat knew her power would do such a thing, and planned on it, or if it's just happy coincidence for her?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, I promised you a reward. Here it is.</p>

          <p>Kusir said Tiamat's power has removed Kahrun's Will from Enos Forest, forcing him to stop the hunting games in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, these games also kept down the population of monsters in the area, so you agreed to help winnow them yourself. Kusir was grateful for your aid.</p>
