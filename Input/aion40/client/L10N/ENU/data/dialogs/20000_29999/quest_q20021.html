          <p>[%username]! Thank Azphel you're here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Artificial Aether Generation Device at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A6] has stopped, and we need you to go there immediately to find out why. Time is of the essence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I already sent Angrad, the most reliable of my Legionaries, to check on the matter, but I promised him that help would soon follow. He can't do it alone!</p>

          <p>As you know, there is very little Aether in Gelkmaros. The generators we've installed don't produce a lot of Aether, but it's enough to help Daeva use their abilities inside the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystal at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A6] Test Site downstream of the Gelkmaros Falls plays a key role in transmitting artificial Aether to Lumiel's Quartz in the Gelkmaros Fortress. It's the most important generator in Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>        	
          <p>It is no exaggeration to say that the outcome of the war depends on the amount of Aether we can secure. If nothing changes, the amount of Aether will drop...and we will have to withdraw in shame. Hurry to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Angrad] if you want to help.</p>

          <p>[%username]! The Brigade General promised help, but I had no idea it would be you. I can think of no one better suited to the task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't made much progress on a solution, frankly. The Aetheric Field Generators work perfectly in other areas--there's no reason it should be malfunctioning here. I will keep at it, but in the meantime, there's something you can help me with.</p>

          <p>But we can't rest on our laurels--there is much more to do. You must visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Wolfgang], the Chairman of the Pandaemonium Research Center, and see if the artificial Aether is being transmitted normally to Lumiel's Quartz over Gelkmaros.</p>

          <p>Those distorted spaces inside Taloc were no doubt created during the Cataclysm. I can imagine how it happened.... Creatures absorbing energy from fragments of the Tower of Eternity, contaminated Aether...no wonder Taloc's Guardian came to this. And no wonder its energy disrupted the Aetheric Field Generator.</p>

          <p>There's still one question, though--about you. Most of those who eat Taloc Fruit have serious side effects. But you...you were transformed into a Guardian General?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the power that the Taloc Fruit gave you comes not from an external source, but from within you. You have a potential as powerful as that of Guardian General! I am in awe.</p>
