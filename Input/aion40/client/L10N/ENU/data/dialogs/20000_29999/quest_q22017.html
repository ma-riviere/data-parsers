          <p>We are here by our own volition. The way I see it, we could've left after that ugly rout and left the Elyos and Reians to play their games together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once their forces were depleted and Tiamat tired of battle, we could've swept in and cleaned up. It was a generosity on our part to agree to this blasted alliance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it is, we're forced into constantly one-upping those twiggies to prove our place here. Speaking of, [%username], I need you to go out into the Frigic Alkali Flats and take out some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Tauric_60_An]s.</p>

          <p>Good. That's one more feather in our cap.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though at this point we've got enough feathers to make the entire cap out of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But leverage over the Elyos is always good. Your reward, [%username].</p>
