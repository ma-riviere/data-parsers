          <p>I've completed my assessment of Agehia's Noble Greatsword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been a long time since a weapon so fine entered my hands. Every aspect is superbly done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have the keenest eye for Weaponsmithing I've ever seen.</p>

          <p>No, you honor me, for being such a fine student. You are now officially qualified to become a Master.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not like me, of course--my version of the title is special. But Master is an exalted rank you can wear with pride.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agehia], and she will confer the title upon you.</p>

          <p>After all you've been through, all you've achieved, you don't want the title? It's not just puffery, you know--the rank of Master opens doors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You really should reconsider.</p>
