          <p>[%username]. Can I ask you something?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will seem like an odd question, and it's probably just a rumor, but... I have to know for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you were in the Crucible Challenge, did you see any Balaur?</p>

          <p>No. It's reassuring that you didn't, but their absence doesn't disprove their existence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mind you, they shouldn't be there at all! There's nothing in the paperwork about Balaur. I'd remember if there was. But I keep hearing stories of Balaur popping up at odd times in the middle of the Crucible Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose it's possible she updated the system and forgot to send me the change forms... Would you do me a favor?</p>

          <p>The Crucibles are managed by [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Inggness], the Daeva of Time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go ask her if she updated the training protocol in the Crucible Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd be surprised though. She's not the type to forget to cross her T's and dot her I's.</p>

          <p>I'll ask someone else to do it later, if it crops up again.</p>
