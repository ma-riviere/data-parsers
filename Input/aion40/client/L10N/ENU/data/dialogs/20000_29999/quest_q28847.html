          <p>Working in Home Security is a duty I take seriously. I may not be guarding an Empyrean Lord, but I safeguard peace all the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps nowhere else is that so important, since so many regard this as their last haven from war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of duty, one of mine is to give a little, shall we say, housewarming gift to new owners such as yourself. Care to see it now?</p>

          <p>My superiors realize very well what it takes to turn a mere house into a home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the major ways is decoration. It reflects the owner's personality, tastes, needs, and wants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This gift, of course, is but a first step in feeling out what you want in a home.</p>

          <p>Oh, no time? That I definitely understand; after all, Daevas come here to get away from hectic lives.</p>

          <p>But, of course, they are inevitably drawn back in again, which makes this an even more important place.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Houses need to reflect the personality and desires of its owner before it truly becomes a home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The purpose of this gift is to get you thinking about what you can do to make your home truly your own.</p>

          <p>Install it in your home, and it'll be that much more like you--more comfortable to you, more enlightening for your guests.</p>

          <p>Well, once you've chosen, I need to get back to my duty. I look forward to seeing you again.</p>
