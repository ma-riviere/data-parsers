          <p>Ugh...don't mind my brother Tanar, [%username]. He often has his head in the clouds, and I can tell you this--he's definitely not the smart one in the family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I respect his intent, he goes about it the wrong way. A true scholar must also be a warrior. If we want to learn about the Balaur, we can't just stand back and sift through the destruction the Archons leave in their wake.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>We must observe the Balaur in their natural setting, and as they don't particularly like being observed...sometimes good research requires a little carnage.</p>

          <p>I knew you would understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even though I'm trained with a blade, my research has been stalled. These creatures native to Balaurea are quite fierce, and I'm having trouble handling them by myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between the beasts and Tanar's meddlesome desire to protect me--he is my big brother after all--I can't get anything done. Would you mind helping me?</p>

          <p>Thanks, [%username]. This will be a big help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most dangerous creatures are the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Baku_Desert_54_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dionaea_Red_54_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Scorpion_Rough_54_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could get rid of them, I would be able to continue my research, and perhaps Tanar wouldn't be so insistent on accompanying me everywhere. He was throwing rocks at a Scolopen yesterday.... Ugh.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you're back just in time. Tanar had a stick and was eyeballing a Baku drifting closer to the camp....</p>
