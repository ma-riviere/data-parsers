          <p>Mine heart languishes at the thought of thee in harm's way--a victim of a hot lesson from a scaled rapscallion...and yet, the flame of battle that rages in thine heart is mine heart's desire.</p>

          <p>Now then...blast those infernal Balaur! The cowards have been pitting their beasts against us, the Drakes and Drakies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ankea and I have slaughtered dozens, but the beasts are relentless, and the Balaur themselves are a larger concern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a favor to ask. We need help defeating [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drake_DR_54_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Draky_DR_54_An]s so we can concentrate on the Balaur. You up to the task, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you, [%username]. Head to Vorgaltem Battlefield and dispatch any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drake_DR_54_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Draky_DR_54_An]s that cross your path.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd need a small army to slaughter all the beasts, but even a dent in their numbers will weaken the Balaur.</p>

          <p>What? I said nothing! Here, [%username], take this, and my thanks. The gutless Balaur will have to fight their own battle soon enough.</p>
