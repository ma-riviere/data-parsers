          <p>Have you ever seen this kind of lock? I came across this chest I had stored away, and I just can't open it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I remember seeing a peculiar device in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_housing_DF_house_001]. There was a ring of keys hanging from it, so perhaps it can open this lock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since I don't have any use for this, you can keep the chest if you unlock it.</p>
