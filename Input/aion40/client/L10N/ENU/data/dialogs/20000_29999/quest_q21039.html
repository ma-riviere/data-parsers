          <p>Pssst. Hey, [%username], if you have some spare time I've, uh, got a job for you. It'll earn you a Mithril Coin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to extract some Aether from some creatures in Balaurea--Strigiks. Heard of them? Quite dangerous, but the same might be said of everything in Gelkmaros, no?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, there are a lot of Strigiks, and the Aether I can extract from them is of very high quality.</p>

          <p>That's not important. What matters is I need it right away. If you want to earn the coin, head to the Strigik Forest and bring me 50 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21039a]s. That should be enough to get some quality Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, also, In order to extract the stuff, you'll need a Disposable Aether Refining Device, which I'd also like to have when you're done. You'll probably have to buy one of those, since mine was...confiscated. But I don't want to talk about that.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Remember, the Strigiks inhabiting the Strigik Forest are quite vicious and tough. I'd suggest taking a few other Daevas with you. I'd go with you myself but I'm...not feeling well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>50 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21039a]s! Good luck!</p>

          <p>Sorry [%username], but I'm not giving you your Mithril coin yet. There's no leeway here--you have to bring me 50 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21039a]s and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_d_redeem_jewelry_02a]. Otherwise I can't extract enough Aether to...use. For my...project.</p>

          <p>Good work. The Aether refined from these [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21039a]s will go a long way towards...supporting the Asmodian efforts here in Gelkmaros. I'll personally handle this particular extraction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's your Mithril Coin. Be sure to visit me again if you want to earn more. Just keep quiet about it, okay?</p>
