          <p>It's time to make this village our home! We're starting a new program to improve every aspect our our village, from fountains to flowers, and bricks to bells!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today's task: Bring three [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fs_material_n_c_d]es and two [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fs_material_n_c_21a_d]es to the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Town_D_shugo_Worker_05] so that construction on the fountain itself can begin!</p>

          <p>Busy, busy times, Daeva! Fountain base has been built, and ground stabilized, but now time for fountain itself! One problem though: can't build fountain out of thin air - we still need materials!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Put a notice up asking for Minor Construction Fluxes and Lesser Construction Fluxes. Did Daeva see? Maybe... Daeva even BROUGHT fluxes? Hmm? Hmm?</p>

          <p>Yes! Knew it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, Daeva! Can now start work on fountain, and soon will have ENTIRE VILLAGE DRENCHED IN WATER! AKAKAKAKAK!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was a joke, Daeva. Fountain will be built exactly to code.</p>

          <p>You read a village notice asking for more construction fluxes so that the fountain could be constructed. Ever the helpful Daeva, you pitched in, gathered the required items, and handed them to the gleeful construction boss.</p>
