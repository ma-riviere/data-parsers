          <p>You know, I made Kromede's Tear out of some very special materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really didn't think about it at first, but now that you've told me about Kromede's Trial....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a funny coincidence, because those materials have a connection to Kromede.</p>

          <p>Heh, yeah, I suppose there's that. But the connection is actually to a weapon--the Longbow of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could smelt Kromede's Tear and fuse it with the bow, creating a weapon that's even stronger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd just need someone--say, you--to get the Longbow of the Judge. I think you'll find it's worth the effort.</p>

          <p>You're the one doing me the favor, actually. If--actually, WHEN--I succeed at this, my reputation will grow even more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae], the actual Kromede, has the Longbow of the Judge right now. But you probably figured that out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find her in the Fire Temple in Morheim. But don't let your memories of Kromede's Trial fool you. She's different now.</p>

          <p>Longbows may seem delicate, but they're really pretty strong, or else they wouldn't function so well on the battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I've handled everything from bows to maces to greatswords taller than most Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if that's your concern, you can fight Kromede with no worries.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>

          <p>If you got the Longbow of the Judge, I can start work right now!</p>

          <p>Ha, you're a cautious Daeva! I admire those who don't go off without thinking.</p>

          <p>If you need more reassurance of my skills, talk to any of the Daevas of Flame. The Longbow of the Judge will be in good hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you have the Longbow, come to me with it in your Cube, and with Kromede's Tear in there too. Of course, you have to get it out of Kromede first. If that's the problem, I can't help you there, sorry.</p>
