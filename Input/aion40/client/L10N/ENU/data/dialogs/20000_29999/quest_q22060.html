          <p>Thank you for the offer, but I'm quite comfortably perched here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, you must agree that if we can't defeat his Legionaries, we won't be able to find success against Tiamat. It's a matter of scale... or scales, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, let's see how we hold up against his best guards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Naduka Legion Garrison, Basrasa Legion Garrison, and Satra Legion Garrison, and then kill as many Legionaries as possible. Bring me their blood-spattered [%dic:STR_DIC_I_tiamat_banner_01]s to wear as a necklace.</p>

          <p>Skafir said Asmodae couldn't hope to have victory over Tiamat if it couldn't defeat the Dragon Lord's legions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated the soldiers of the Naduka Legion, Basrasa Legion, and Satra Legion, then collected their Legionary's Epaulets. Skafir claimed she'd wear them as a bloody necklace, but you privately doubted the likelihood of this plan.</p>
