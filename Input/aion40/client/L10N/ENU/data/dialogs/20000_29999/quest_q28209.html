          <p>I reported the Crucible Rift problem to my superiors, but I need to figure out what to do in the meantime. Paperwork moves very slowly through those elevated command levels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't just sit here like sun-poxed Elyos while Balaur keep pouring into the Crucible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you were over talking to Inggness, a group of trainees was ambushed by Balaur! They're in pretty bad shape....</p>

          <p>I'd love to, but that would be a political nightmare. The sheer mounds of paperwork! Hmm...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, that kind of decision is way above my pay grade.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see if we can't just deal with this ourselves, shall we? You're one of our best and brightest, [%username]. Think you could take on those Balaur on your own?</p>

          <p>That's the spirit! Nerves like iron and shadow!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go into the Solo Crucible, subdue Vanktrist Spacetwine until another [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In] opens. Then go through and smite those shard-blasted [%dic:STR_DIC_M_quest_28208a]s before they set foot on Asmodian soil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Might be a bit tricky, that. Vanktrist never says down for long, but go! For the greater glory of Asmodae and Lord Marchutan!</p>

          <p>Marvelous. Can you just fill in this form for me? This section, right here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interestingly, I've had others patrolling the Crucible too, and under 'Enemy Encountered,' they keep checking Elyos, rather Balaur. Did you run into any Elyos? Oh, well... I'll have to talk to Inggness about it. Seems like there might be more than one rift fittering about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, great job. Please, take this reward for your continued service to the Marchutan Priory.</p>
