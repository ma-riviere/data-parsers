	<p>Brought me any Ancient Icons, [%username]? Better we have them than the cowards of Elysea.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They'll mount them and start an art movement based on whatever flimsy emotion it stirs in their delicate little hearts. We'll study them for information, then use that information to advance our understanding of our world. Substance over style. It's the Asmodian way.</p>

	<p>Now, what have you brought me?</p>

	<p>Almost as useless as an Elyos with a sword, these Lesser Ancient Icons.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Still, I've been ordered to accept them, and reward you for your work. Just keep a look out for higher grade stuff, eh? You'll get a better reward, and we'll have wasted less of our time. Win win, eh?</p>

	<p>Ancient Icons. Not bad, [%username], not bad at all.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I'll send them on to our team back in Pandaemonium. Not sure if they'll be able to extract any information from it, but better to try and fail, than to sit back like a pampered Elyos and do nothing.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thanks. Here's your reward.</p>

	<p>Would you look at that! [%username], collector of Greater Icons!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If you keep building up these titles, pal, you're going to need one almighty grave once you finally slip into the Aether. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Well, no point chatting when you could be out there finding more of these. Take your reward and do whatever it is you do best, [%username]. Blood for blood!</p>

	<p>You've outdone yourself, [%username]!</p>

	<p>These are in almost perfect condition! See this icon? Shows the peace treaty the cowards tried to initiate with the Balaur. Idiots.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Anyway, these are excellent. Take your reward with our thanks. Blood for blood, [%userclass]!</p>

	<p>Ancient Icons aren't often seen in Asmodae. The weather's too fierce to keep anything ancient intact, see. Turns everything to dust, given enough time. Everything except us, that is.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Still, we need to know our past. That's why we take the Icons in. We study them, work out what message they're conveying. Complicated stuff.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Return to me any time you have ten Ancient Icons of the same grade.</p>
