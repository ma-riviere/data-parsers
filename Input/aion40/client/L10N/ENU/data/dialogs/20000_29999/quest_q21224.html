          <p>What? You still don't know what a Dramata is? Bah! Explaining's just a waste of time. If you go searching for a Dramata, you probably won't retur... Er, you won't even find any proof it exists!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fine...but this is the last time! Imagine the moment that a Human ascends to become a Daeva. Now imagine possessing all the qualities of a Daeva, but Aion refusing to grant you your wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's what happens to Dramata--they're vastly powerful, but fail to take that final step towards awakening as a Balaur.</p>

          <p>In Asmodae, there's no shame in being Human, but amongst the Balaur, those that possess tremendous power but fail to awaken are considered failures, ridiculed and disgraced.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hunting a Dramata is like hunting a recluse. They prefer dark places deep underground, and surround themselves with the only beings who will not ridicule them--their children. A Dramata itself is an outcast, but its children become soldiers of the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There...satisfied? Now, let me get to the point. We're hunting Dramata here in Gelkmaros, and we think there's one at the Earthfang Gorge, but we need proof. Will you help us, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent! I just need you to head to the Earthfang Gorge, and slay the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_21204]s there. Their insignias are proof that their mother, a Dramata, lurks there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? Of course I've sent others to there! They just didn't come bac... I mean, they all came back happier than a Shugo in a coin vault, but didn't find proof that a Dramata was there... Yes....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This should be a piece of cake for a Daeva like you! Am I right?</p>

          <p>Hmmm, I wonder if that gnawed-on arm Olga found was Mirchen.... It looked like his arm, but I sent him to the Earthfang Gorge weeks ago. It wouldn't have been that fresh....</p>
