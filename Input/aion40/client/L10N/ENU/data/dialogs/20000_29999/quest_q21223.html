          <p>Olga has picked up the trail of a Dramata, [%username]! This could be Padmarashka--we're not sure, but regardless, it's an important find!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm still not sure how she did it. I saw her devouring some kind of animal over there not too long ago...then all the sudden she picked up the scent of a Dramata, as if she were a beast!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Olga's a little mad, but her tracking skills are without match. The Dramata will no doubt be hidden in some deep cavern, guarded by its children. The reason many doubt Dramata exist is because few Asmodians who have gone looking for them ever return....</p>

          <p>Hahaha, nonsense, [%username]! A Daeva of your talent would have no problem dispatching a Dramata and a few of its children! That's why I wnt you to be the scout for our force....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? No, of course this isn't some kind of suicide mission! Why ever would you think that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe there's a Dramata hiding somewhere in the XX region of Gelkmaros. We've sent several other scouts, but none have retur...I mean...they all came back...but no sign of the Dramata. What do you say, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent! I'm sure a Daeva of your renown will find the evidence we're looking for even though the others were eat...I mean, all came back in one piece!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Head to the XX and look for the Balaur. Slay them, and find some kind of proof that you've discovered the Dramata's lair. Under no circumstances are you to approach the Dramata itself. In fact, it would be better if it remains unaware of your presence....</p>
