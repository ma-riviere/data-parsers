          <p>Have you heard? We've discovered a black market for the sale of Stigmas. It's not inherently wrong to buy Stigma at a cheap price--even Archons want to save some Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, the problem is that these are Fake Stigmas, and they're causing serious side effects. Some have fallen unconscious, some have gone insane...the symptoms are varied, and countless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Needless to say, Pandaemonium ordered the Archon of Dusk to track down the organization circulating this illegal Stigma.</p>

          <p>The result was unpleasantly surprising. According to the Archon of Dusk, the source of the illegal Stigma is right here in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure what to do with this information.... Frankly, I'm overwhelmed. My hands are full with other matters, but it is urgent that this be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be blunt, [%username]. I would like you to head up this Fake Stigma investigation. Can you help me?</p>

          <p>On this mission, you must report to no one but me. I suspect there might be some inside connections here, including among the Archons. Use caution and discretion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The prime suspect here is Hudrunerk. He showed up in the fortress at about the time the Fake Stigma started circulating.</p>

          <p>Here is the box. Regulations have been quite strict lately, so tell Hudrunerk that the items have doubled in price. Negotiation is not an option.</p>

          <p>I will deliver a report to the Archon of Dusk immediately, but before I do, I must ask one more question. Did you have a strange...dream when you touched the Fake Stigma?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmmm.... Usually, side effects arise when you equip the Fake Stigma or use the Stigma Skill. I had heard of this happening at least once before. I must research this further....</p>
