          <p>Did you know that ginseng also being grown here? I do not know why; maybe it is because of Rooties being used to pollenate Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it seems to be profitable side-business. Ginseng is very high-quality, very tasty! Tried some myself! Now too spoiled for any other kind, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say, that reminds me of friend Chagarinerk at Altgard Fortress. Did you know he is getting married to Mahirinerk? Her family very wealthy, so she is good catch!</p>

          <p>Mahirinerk is very fond of ginseng soup. But good ginseng too expensive for Chagarinerk. Of course, that is big reason why he is marrying her in first place!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, must make him feel helpless to not be able to provide for wife such a little thing. Moofrenerk wants to help him out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I cannot be caught taking anything, even ginseng. Perhaps Daeva could help me help him?</p>

          <p>You will not regret! Now, you must get five pieces of ginseng from Odella Processing Plant. There is also big cauldron of soup there used for MuMu Ham the Grey's lunches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Boil ginseng in soup, then scoop some out and take to Chagarinerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is good! Now Chagarinerk will owe Moofrenerk a favor! When he gets married to rich Mahirinerk, he will owe me plenty!</p>

          <p>You found the ginseng in the Odella Processing Plant, then boiled it in the soup-like substance in the cauldron there to create a soup that was actually good.</p>
