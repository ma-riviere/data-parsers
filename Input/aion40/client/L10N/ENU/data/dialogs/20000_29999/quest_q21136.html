          <p>Of course! Bibi Ven!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's the oldest Skurv here. I think he was some sort of chieftain when Nunglark was still standing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's very talkative--doesn't care who's listening. He's been a very rich...source for me.</p>

          <p>He's over...hmm, no he's not. He seems to move around quite a bit. He'll be around here somewhere, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Frankly, I'm never certain how much of his words are truth, and how much is a tall tale. I must work hard just to sort through half of what he says.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there are enough gems amongst the dung that he might be worth your time.</p>

          <p>I must warn you: Skurvs don't live to be his age by being shy. He'll probably ask for something in exchange for helping you.</p>

          <p>Once he's fed, he'll talk so much that you'll want to kill yourself or him. But if he knows what you need, he'll tell you.</p>
