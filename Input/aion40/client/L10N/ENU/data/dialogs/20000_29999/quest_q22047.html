          <p>We have the Heart of Petrification now, but the true test of our strength will be found in our ability to keep this place flying Asmodian banners. The Balaur will do everything they can to take this place back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means our defenses have to be absolutely solid. Our soldiers are doing their best, but the Crystalump Basilisks are making their tasks extremely difficult. I really need someone to go out there and kill the Basilisks off. You, obviously, would be a perfect candidate for the task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But do you have time? Can you help?</p>

          <p>Lumiden told you how the Crystalump Basilisks were taking the Heart of Petrification guards from their tasks. Realizing that they needed to fully concentrate on repelling the Balaur, you offered to help, and destroyed the creatures.</p>
