          <p>I have lived in Gelkmaros for longer than you've probably been alive, young Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The coming of your people here is the most significant event I've seen since the Cataclysm. I don't know yet if it's enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, I've become attuned to the aura and emotions of Balaurea. Something has been disturbing both of late.</p>

          <p>Taloc, to be specific. Although he grows in Inggison, he is a beacon of energy that I can sense even from here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Daevas from both your world and your enemy's have been entering his boughs, seeking glory by destroying his parasites.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By intruding so, they upset what little serenity he has left. But I have a plan to stop this, if you could aid me...?</p>

          <p>I propose that you eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11048_2F]. Less prey means fewer hunters, and will lessen Taloc's pain as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are welcome inside Taloc, so you will not disturb him as the others do.</p>

          <p>You are doing more good than you know, young Daeva. Remember that as you battle.</p>
