          <p>Was afraid this would happen soon. Looks like Haramel is in last days! Better get out while getting is good, nyerk!</p>

          <p>But how to take as much profit as I can...? Hrm.... Oh! That reminds me! Daeva!</p>

          <p>Moorilerk is worried about brother Moofrenerk, nyerk! I am near entrance, but brother is in middle of facility!</p>

          <p>What will happen if Daevas attack, and brother is caught in middle? He could be...hurt! That would be horrible!</p>

          <p>Brother could escape on his own, but Kobolds stand in his way, nyerk! Could you kill them so he can get away freely?</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you, thank you! Family is extremely important to Shugo, you know! Maybe even more than Kinah!</p>

          <p>You do not have to clear out Odium Refinery and Odium Strip Mine. Just kill enough Kobolds so Moofrenerk can sneak by.</p>

          <p>Oh, and go tell Moofrenerk when you are done that escape path is clear. Moorilerk leaves this up to you!</p>

          <p>Of course! That is why! Brother asked you to kill Kobolds so he could take Odium without interference! He was probably stealing while you were finding me! Akakak! Do not know whether to be angry or proud! He did just what I would have done!</p>
