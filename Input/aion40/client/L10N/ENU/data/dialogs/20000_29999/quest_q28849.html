          <p>Lesser indeed. Yes, these goblets not in such good shape. All scrunched up and twisty, just globs of metal. They are more like...globlets, akakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can still use them, of course, just lots more work to fix up. That's why Abyss Point reward is lower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is adequate, yes?</p>

          <p>Regular old Ancient Goblets, nothing special.</p>

          <p>Well, they look authentic enough. Take reward and keep bringing goblets whenever you have them!</p>

          <p>Greater Ancient Goblets? More like Greatest Ancient Goblets, akakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, greatest would be Major, and these are not them. Confused yet?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still valuable, though. Look at shining gold, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Used to be Captain Goblet, got promoted to Major, akakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>10 of them all together? How did Daeva manage this? Is very great achievement. Must be special Daeva indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, no, never reveal sources. Is first principle of Shugo code. Or perhaps second principle. Anyway, take reward and keep hush-hush.</p>

          <p>No, Daeva, Shugo knows difference between pocket lint and relic. Not so gub--ah, gullible--when it comes to goblets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ten goblets is what I want, don't care which kind.</p>

          <p>No, no, no. I am sure you are very nice Daeva, but so inexperienced.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Orders say, only Daevas of at least level 40 can trade. Union rules, you know, nyerk?</p>

          <p>Ten Ancient Goblets? Are you sure? Shugo was top of counting class in Shugo school, and this doesn't look like ten.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You sure you didn't get robbed by Shulack Pickpockets, nyerk?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, come back with ten when you have them.</p>
