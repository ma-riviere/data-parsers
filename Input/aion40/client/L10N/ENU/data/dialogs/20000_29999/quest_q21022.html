          <p>Of all the things that sustain us, water is perhaps the most important. Even Daevas cannot function without it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you looked at Gelkmaros Falls? Really looked at it? If you have not, you should. It's the primary source of water for Gelkmaros Fortress.</p>

          <p>Good. Then the fact that we don't even know its source should make you as uneasy as it does me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Who knows what the Balaur could do to it, and thus to the fortress. We'd never even know until it's too late.</p>

          <p>We must never forget that they know this land better than us. We are the intruders.</p>

          <p>Exactly. Twice each day, I examine the plants and creatures in the area. They too are nourished by Gelkmaros Falls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Should anything serious--deliberate or otherwise--happen to the fall's water, they will show the effects first. I could find what's wrong and enact countermeasures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I was about to go on my rounds. Would you care to assist me?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Many claws make quick kills, as they say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I gather plant specimens, please gather creature samples. My methods do not require battle, but I don't think they'd work for you.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dionae_DR_51_New]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_51_n]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_Big_51_An]s are best for my purposes.</p>

          <p>No, I suppose it's not the most glamorous or even easy work. But I hope I've impressed upon you its importance.</p>

          <p>Please don't mind me. The routine is quite comforting, actually, and the time flies by....</p>

          <p>Welcome back. I've already finished analyzing the plant samples. Some changes, but nothing worrying so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll know more when I take a look at the creature samples. They use more water, after all.</p>

          <p>I'm afraid not. My work is very exact--I need a specific number of samples to make a proper comparison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If there are any water contaminants, traces will show in the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21021a]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21021b]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21021c]s.</p>

          <p>Hm, some mildly curious traces. But they seem harmless. I'll examine them further later, but everything appears normal.</p>
