          <p>Those Elyos would have to double their strength if they want a hope of touching us! What a battle! It's exhilarating, isn't it?</p>

          <p>Agent Mastarius said that we have you to thank for today's victory. Is that correct, [%userclass]? I have a reward for you, if so.</p>

          <p>You are willing to go it alone, without the Agent's aid? That's very admirable, but not necessary. We are all stronger if we band together.</p>
