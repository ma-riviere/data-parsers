          <p>Dear [%username]! You've returned just in time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It really didn't take long. Quality speaks in a loud voice, after all.</p>

          <p>Congratulations, Master Alchemist.</p>

          <p>Yes, of course! Your Agehia's Noble Spellbook is already winging its way into the High Priest's hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that your title means quite as much as mine, of course--I will always be teacher--but it's still an extraordinary achievement.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now all that remains is the official bestowing of your title.</p>

          <p>I would give it to you myself if I could--perhaps I should have the power, but I don't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, High Priest Agehia will do that. It will also give her the opportunity to give you her plaudits in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already written out the recommendation. Take this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agehia] at the Convent of Marchutan. Again, congratulations.</p>

          <p>Really, now, there are limits to modesty. This title isn't just meaningless arrogance, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have great natural talent. It'd be a shame to hide it under a title less than you deserve.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Superiority must shine! So accept the title--so many will be disappointed if you don't.</p>
