          <p>Hmm. But if you can't go to Gelkmaros Falls by Air Line, then I have a bit of a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not allowed to leave the fortress. You see, I'm Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was only able to come to Gelkmaros because of Master Svasuth's name!</p>

          <p>I know. But it does make it difficult for me to do my job. Of course, Master Svasuth does THAT all by himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you're a Daeva.... Could I ask one more favor of you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A3] and search for Master Svasuth?</p>

          <p>That's extremely kind of you. I wish Master Svasuth could be so considerate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, don't get me wrong. He's quite kind and treats me very well. He's just...free-spirited in the extreme.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He should be near the base of the waterfall. If not, look for his suitcase. It might have clues...or at least lure him back here when he can't change clothes or eat.</p>

          <p>Nothing? That can't be. Master Svasuth isn't a Ranger...he can't survive in the wild without something of civilization!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides which, he's more forgetful than an Elyos with a head wound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine he wouldn't leave SOMETHING behind. His suitcase is the best bet. Please look again.</p>

          <p>Well, at least Master Svasuth is alive...or was at that point, and we know where he's been.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, when he finds he's missing his suitcase, he'll return sooner or later.</p>

          <p>Now all I can do is wait. Thanks for doing this for me.</p>
