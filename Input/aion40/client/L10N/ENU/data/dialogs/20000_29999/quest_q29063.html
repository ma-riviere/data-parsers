          <p>Oh, don't look so confused. I mean that I've taught you everything I can about being a [%userclass]. I'm giving you a recommendation letter to take to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aranolf] at the Convent of Marchutan. She's agreed to take over your training now.</p>

          <p>[%username], I was wondering when you'd arrive. So many Daevas just come to me for skill manuals, but Freyr said you'd be coming to me for training too. I'm looking forward to training another [%userclass] again. It's been a long time for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should probably give me Freyr's recommendation letter too. Even Pandaemonium runs on paperwork, it seems.</p>

          <p>Good, everything appears to be in order. Talk to me again when you're ready to train. I love having the chance to instill skills into a talented [%userclass]!</p>
