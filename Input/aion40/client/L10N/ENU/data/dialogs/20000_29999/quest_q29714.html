          <p>The story of how Lord Marchutan raised this place from the dust of history will be legend in Pandaemonium forever.</p>

          <p>A Shedim Lord raising a former Balaur fortress from ruin, then taking it over as our own....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let one of Ariel's goons try to match that!</p>

          <p>To be sure. Of course, the Balaur were not happy at our insult. They still seek to retake this place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's no surprise. Our presence here is a constant reminder of their impotence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, reclaiming it would be a major strategic and morale coup for them...the opposite for us.</p>

          <p>Of course not. But it never pays to underestimate the enemy, especially when they have numbers like the Balaur do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, time spent defending this fortress takes away from resources better spent elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like you to buy us some breathing room by driving away Balaur surrounding this place.</p>

          <p>Glad to have you aboard. Your mission is to kill Crusaders, Assassins and Rangers in the general area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We hope that seeing their fellows mowed down so easily will discourage future assaults for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd ask the Fatebound Legion, but they're better used elsewhere. I hope you can handle this.</p>

          <p>I realize you are relatively new to Gelkmaros, but there comes a time when caution must give way to action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This fortress is heavily fortified, but time we spend defending it is time not spent bringing the battle to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely you're not frightened of this land? We are on Tiamat's doorstep, but any Asmodian should be excited by the prospect!</p>

          <p>Excellent! Thanks to your work, I was able to send a Legionary squad on a major assault in Marayas!</p>
