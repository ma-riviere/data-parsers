          <p>Hah! Turned out Balaurea was a waste of time. The unstable Aether contaminated the minerals, and most of them are worthless.</p>

          <p>Wait...what's in this pouch? Oh no...she didn't. Shards! I told her the Sunken Canyon was dangerous! This is serious, [%username]. Let me guess...she found a piece of Antimoni ore emanating an eerie light? Started to hear voices? Now she's a raving lunatic?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is bad.... When I visited Gelkmaros, I discovered that Tiamat's power corrupted the ore in the Sunken Canyon. But I know how to help. Take this, and hand it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Carabel]. It's a mineral purifier infused with Aether. It should cleanse any impure mineral in close proximity.</p>

          <p>Carabel was being possessed by a creature that called itself Infisto. But she was able to break the creature's hold for a moment and told you to take an Ore Pouch full of Antimoni to Horu in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Horu gave you a Tainted Mineral Purifier, which you then used to purge Infisto from Carabel. She was most grateful, and gave you a generous reward. </p>
