          <p>Luigir said that if you took the box containing the Blade Fragments to Centurion Relyt, he would tell you how to restore the sword.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ukon restored the sword by reforging the Blade Fragments and the hilt together, but without its original power. He said that you should defeat Debilkarim the Maker in Lower Udas Temple to restore Tiamat's Power completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Debilkarim and took a fully restored Tiamat's Power to Centurion Relyt. The centurion praised your hard work and gave you a substantial reward.</p>
