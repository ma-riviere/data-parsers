        <body>
          <p>While I was doing my investigations, I stumbled upon some serious information about the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are planning to take the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Agrint_Burn_58_An]s you see around here and mutate them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure how, but you can bet the result won't be happy forests filled with happy trees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you should kill Firebrand Agrints to head this plan off at the pass, then tell Kaisa. She'll get the ball rolling on the rest.</p>

          <p>Hmm... I wonder if there's a way to imbue heat into thread? I should ask Zyakia about that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, [%username]! Did you find Olbein? What did he have to say?</p>

          <p>Hmm, a deep plot indeed. I'll report to Pandaemonium and have them send help to take care of the rest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But your actions have brought us some much needed breathing room to deal with this threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And my thanks to you, for proving that my choice of sending you was a good one.</p>

          <p>Olbein discovered that the Balaur were planning to mutate Firebrand Agrints for their own sinister purposes.</p>

          <p>To delay this plot, you killed some Agrints before reporting to Kaisa, who planned to report to Pandaemonium to take care of the rest.</p>
