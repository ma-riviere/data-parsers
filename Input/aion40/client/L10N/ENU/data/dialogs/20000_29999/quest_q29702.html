          <p>You saved us from destruction via mining. But with one irritant gone, we can see more. The athenosphere, the deepest layer of Raksang, shifts wildly.</p>

          <p>Irritated by constant exposure to Drana energy, it flows like river rapids rather than a serene brook.</p>

          <p>If the Synthral Wardens continue as they are, who know what could happen? Magma plumes? Tectonic breaks? Please, save our world!</p>

          <p>Interesting that removing the Drana stimulus caused such a quick reaction in the athenosphere.</p>

          <p>I'll keep an eye on things, watch out for other sudden changes.</p>

          <p>According to Kenros, the slowly moving liquid layer underneath Raksang's earth started to rush about erratically. He could only guess at the disasters this agitation might cause. Earthquakes? Volcanoes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless of effect, he said the cause was too much Drana in the area. So you went into Raksang and eliminated Drana-soaked Synthral Wardens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This led to a calmer athenosphere, according to Kenros, and he gave you a gift.</p>
