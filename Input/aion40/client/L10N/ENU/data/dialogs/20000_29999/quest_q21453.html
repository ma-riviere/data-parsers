          <p>Oh...erm...it's you. Have you seen your friend [%username] around? I have some bad news to pass along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It turns out that the Mosqua Fluid that [%username] obtained from Taloc is far too poisonous to use with the antidote I have. I suppose I should have tested my cure first. Poor Grivas....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, "the cure to a poison lies with the source of the poison"--this is the fundamental law of toxicology. Are you paying attention? I know you have a hard time keeping up.</p>

          <p>If the toxin produces the cure, then where else might I find an antidote to a poison made from excessive Aether energy? With a source of Aether energy, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the answer lies within Elim Fruit. Within the fruit is a particularly powerful energy that can only be utilized by Elim...unless properly distilled.</p>

          <p>I need your friend [%username] to get some, yes. But where?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taloc was once an Elim, but obviously he's out. There are Elim in Asmodae, but would their fruit have Aether in the amount and type I need?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I wish [%username] was here. In comparison, your knowledge is...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tree_NoMove_Miener].</p>

          <p>Yes, Miener! He is apparently one of the last Elim left in Gelkmaros. If only [%username] could get his fruit....</p>
