          <p>So, I saw this group of real shook up refugees this morning, with a missing door on their wagon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A missing door! They said Humnaz Calydons tore it off as they passed southern [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1_04].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could ask for the Zayedans to cull the Calydons, but manpower is so tight, I need proof they're a threat before they'll send a single soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't leave my post, right? Someone might need me. But you could go down there and get some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q21517_ebi] that shows the Calydons are responsible, right?</p>

          <p>[%username]! You've got to let me tell you about this crazy refugee who came through while you were out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To start with, he's three times as tall as I am. Three times!</p>

          <p>Now we have proof, I'd better let the Zayedans know. Thanks for bringing this back.</p>
