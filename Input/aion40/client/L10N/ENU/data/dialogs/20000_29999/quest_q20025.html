          <p>After reporting to Richelle, you visited with Valetta, who said she had found Kumbanda's whereabouts and asked you to chase him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With Anilmo's aid you located Kumbanda, but with the power of the relic he evaded all pursuers, including you, the Fatebound Legion, and Tiamat's chasers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before chasing him again, you asked Heimdall and Vellun for help. You received Anuhart's Vitality from Heimdall and gathered Balaur's blood as Vellun ordered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hresvelgr made a solution to control Kumbanda's mind by mixing these two items with Tahabata's Blood. With information from Ranack and Hrimfaxi, you headed to the Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Beshmundir Temple and incapacitated Kumbanda with the Mind Control Potion, but failed to retrieve Siel's Relics, which fell into the hands of Tiamat's army.</p>
