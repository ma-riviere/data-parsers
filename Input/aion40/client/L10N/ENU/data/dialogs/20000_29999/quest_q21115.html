          <p>I once talked to an archaeologist about Marayas. He was long-winded, but very interesting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just enjoy imagining what the city was like when it was new--when citizens walked its streets, lived in its buildings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Looking at it now, it's a little sad to realize just how far it's fallen.</p>

          <p>True. But what's left in the ruins are still in decent shape, considering how long it's been since they were built.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if it's because of magical spells, the architecture, or maybe the strength of the stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Probably the stone, since it's still giving us problems today.</p>

          <p>Rubble from the ruins have been turning into rock monsters that attack our patrols. I don't know what kind of lingering magic caused them to rise, but my superiors are getting fed up.</p>

          <p>We'll coordinate so we keep to opposite ends of the city. That way we won't step on each other's toes.</p>
