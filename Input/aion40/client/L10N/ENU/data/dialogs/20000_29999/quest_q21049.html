          <p>Master Aud always said I could only become a true Stigma Master if I went to Gelkmaros. I resented him at first, but after spending some time here I finally understand what he meant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even in my wildest dreams I could not have imagined the secret to expanding Stigma slots was hidden here--inside Taloc!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may know, a Stigma slot can be created only with the crystalline form of extremely strong Aether energy. As it turns out, such energy can be found within Taloc.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21049a]s have incredible power. Three of them give one the ability to use an extra Stigma. Reliable, too--I didn't fail even once in my attempt to unlock their power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As these special soul stones can only be obtained inside Taloc, gathering three is not an easy task. But if you want to unlock more Stigma power...it's the only way. Are you interested?</p>

          <p>Evidently, you can obtain [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21049a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_1F_ClodwormNM_52_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_NeutWorkmanfly_Qeen_52_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DElim_3F_KomadeNM_53_Ae]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring me three such soul stones, and I will expand your Stigma slots. It is as simple as that.</p>

          <p>But can I give you some advice? I have long retired from warfare, but when I was active it was the ability to use Stigma that often decided the outcome of a battle.</p>

          <p>Many creatures leave shards when they die, but most of them are useless. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21049a]s contain such an incredible amount of Aether because the parasites need it to survive inside Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That accumulated Aether energy is the crucial factor in unlocking extra Stigma power. But don't take my word for it. If you have three such stones with you, I will show you.</p>
