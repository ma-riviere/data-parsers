          <p> </p>
          <p>The good news is I've finished my evaluation, and you've passed the Master test with flying colors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, the Convent of Marchutan has already gotten your samples.</p>

          <p>Someone will...ah...have to recreate those dishes again for the actual banquet, because I sort of...ate everything you gave me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, you should be very proud of yourself. I haven't seen anyone with such natural talent in the kitchen since, well, me.</p>

          <p>The ceremony will be led by High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agehia] herself. It's a great honor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give her this letter at the Convent of Marchutan, and you'll officially be a Master Chef.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and tell her it's not your fault that the banquet food will be a little late. I...take full responsibility. But oh, Aion, was it worth it!</p>

          <p>I know most titles are empty nonsense designed just to inflate egos, but this one's different.</p>

          <p>When someone in the culinary world meets a Master, it's a special occasion. It commands respect and awe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, you'll rob ME of being known as a teacher to a Master Chef! So you'd better change your mind, or you'll be fricassee!</p>
