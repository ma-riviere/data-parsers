          <p>Is it true that you are a champion of those in need? If so, then I...I am ashamed to admit this, but I need your aid.</p>

          <p>Senegal was a Reian like myself. He...we...had a...relationship. He.... Ah, it's so painful to think of, even now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragonbound took him during a raid. When next I saw him, he was one of them. I killed him, with my own hands, as we agreed. So he could die before spilling Reian blood....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish to entomb his belongings with him, but one is missing: [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21123a]. [%username], please help me find Senegal's Arrow.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21123a] was special, more a good luck charm than weapon. I'm sure one of the Dragonbound in Subterranea has it.</p>

          <p>Senegal fletched it himself with Crestlich feather, so it will be easily recognizable.</p>

          <p>Ah, you think it foolish of me to risk lives for a single arrow? Ortiz thinks the same. He does not want to see any more Reians put themselves at risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this will be done, even if I have to do it myself. I will not let Senegal's memory be any further sullied by the Dragonbound.</p>

          <p>The green twine, the Crestlich feather.... Yes, this is indeed Senegal's Arrow. It almost feels warm from his touch. Or is that a childish fancy of mine?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps now he will rest peacefully. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
