          <p>Oh...dead? Shame. He probably could've given us a clear account of events. But if what you heard about him recording the attack is true....</p>

          <p>Welcome back. Skira's already sent over her report. I appreciate your efforts.</p>

          <p>Pity.... It sounds like this Berokin would've made a fine member of the Research Center, even if he was a Shulack.</p>

          <p>Let me see this Image Marble of his. Perhaps I can do something with it.</p>

          <p>Hmmm. I think I recognize the principles behind its operation. Brilliant! Unfortunately, it's far more damaged than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need to send this to the 1st Pandaemonium Research Center for examination. Hopefully, they'll figure out how to repair it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this reward, with my gratitude. If we do succeed in fixing the Image Marble, I'll contact you.</p>

          <p>You brought the Image Marble to Skira, who confirmed your impression that it didn't work. She told you to take it to chairman Vellun.</p>

          <p>Vellun declared the Image Marble beyond his abilities to fix, and sent it to the 1st Pandaemonium Research Center for examination.</p>
