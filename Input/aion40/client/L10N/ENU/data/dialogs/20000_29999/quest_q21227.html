          <p>Shards! Those blockheads at the Vorgaltem Citadel have been overrun!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't get me wrong, [%username], I'm sure Krizarid is holding fast--the man is a monster. I've heard Archons whispering that the reason Naga exist is because he likes breaking off Drakan legs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he's just one man, and he can't win against hundreds! At least...I don't think he can.</p>

          <p>We need to clear the area of enemy soldiers. That way we can storm the Tower itself with minimal casualties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to stop their advance if we ever want to retake Vorgaltem Citadel. Each foothold we keep here in Gelkmaros is vital.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can dispose of the guards at the Vorgaltem Citadel, we'll be one step closer.</p>

          <p>Join forces with others if you can. Retaking the citadel won't be easy. Once it can be captured, slay the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q21227all] to take down their defenses. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well? Don't just stand there! Get moving!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and here's some advice. If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Krizarid] is fighting, stay out of the way! And be sure to talk to him after you've retaken the citadel, but don't mention that I sent you as backup--he'll take it as an insult!</p>

          <p>I must have swallowed a couple bucketfuls of blood in that last battle. I strike them below the neck and it comes gushing out like a fountain!</p>

          <p>I suppose I should be thankful, because a bloodbath means I don't have to bathe in the spring, but making me swallow their blood.... Well, that's just rude!</p>
