          <p>And knowing is half the battle, that's true. But the other half is having a plan of attack. Here's what I propose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To reinforce the Warhammer of the Judge, you need three things. You need Kromede's Flame, the Warhammer of the Judge, and a talented smith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first and last you already have. The Warhammer of the Judge? There's the rub. Want to find it?</p>

          <p>We need to proceed carefully. It's not like Warhammer of the Judges are falling out of the sky, after all....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't tell anyone else, but I heard you can get the Warhammer of the Judge from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple of Morheim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems obvious, I know, but you keep that quiet. You wouldn't want everyone to know about that place.</p>

          <p>Don't weep for Kromede.... She's been taken over by grief and hate. She doesn't deserve your compassion anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, give 'em over, and I'll have that thing refined in no time flat.</p>

          <p>Maybe I'll show you some day...if you quit waffling and work with me here! Now hurry up, get the Warhammer and Kromede's Flame in your Cube, and pay me a visit.</p>
