          <p>I knew I'd seen that scrap metal somewhere before!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This used to be part of a Petralith, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't know what that is? You dolt! There's a dilapidated one in Reshanta! The Petraliths are ancient, and not much is known about them. We do know that their power was colossal, and the Balaur feared them, which makes this an exciting find.</p>

          <p>Well, I don't know if I'd call it a weapon. I mean, if I threw this lump of scrap metal at an Elyos Guardian's head, I'm sure it'd hurt, but a blade would...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, you meant the Petraliths.... Yes, they were designed to annihilate the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a  reason we don't know much about them--their internal components were so delicate that most were destroyed by battle or time. But this piece you brought is solid...almost whole.</p>

          <p>How should I know? I'm not a blasted researcher!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It could have something to do with Tiamat, but I don't know. I do know that we're lucky to have found this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We might be able to find more parts from the Petraliths if we return to the area where you found this lump of scrap metal. This could be a monumental find, so please help me look for more!</p>
