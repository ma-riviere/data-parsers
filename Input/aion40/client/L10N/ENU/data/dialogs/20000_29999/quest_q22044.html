          <p>We control the area for now, [%username], but the Balaur won't slink back like some twiggy scout patrol. No. They're likely organizing payback as we stand here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to be ready for their attack. Our soldiers need their wounds tended to, their swords sharpened, and their armor hammered back into shape. But we can't take any of them off the frontlines until other threats have been dealt with. That's where you can help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Shadowstalker_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Gargoyle_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Cherubim_58_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Basilisk_60_An]s dead. Can you do it?</p>

          <p>No Balaur attack yet, but they grow stronger with every passing day.</p>

          <p>How did you do? Can we finally have our soldiers seen to?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With our troops refreshed, we stand a better chance of rebuffing the Balaur attack, and solidifying our grip here. Good work, [%userclass]!</p>

          <p>Rurus told you that the Asmodian guards needed to rest up following the capture of the area, but couldn't because of the local creatures that had been attacking relentlessly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went out and dealt with the creatures yourself, allowing the guards to prepare for the inevitable Balaur asssault.</p>
