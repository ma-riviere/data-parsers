          <p>Tools? I don't need any tools. I've got everything I need. I'm known for improvising in difficult straits. Wish I had more room, though....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already got the design completed in my head. It's not like I had anything better to do other than moping and waiting for them to kill me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, but it seems there's more that I'll need to make this escape work.</p>

          <p>Like I said, this crystal will let the Balaur enter and leave freely, but no other species. I'd hoped to use this armor to fool it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it looks like it's more complex than I thought. I also need to duplicate a Drakan's face, posture, heartbeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I can do it, but I'll need to add a power source to the armor. Can you get what I need again?</p>

          <p>Hopefully this works. I'd rather test it first, but.... Oh, well, sometimes you have to run before you can walk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Q21248]s. They're Balaur weapons infused with Drana. Maybe mount one on each shoulder?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two should provide sufficient power. I'll work what I can while you're gone. May Aion speed your search.</p>

          <p>Good timing. I just finished my modifications to this armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I needed was a little magic, a little smithing skill, and a little luck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now all I need is a little power. Let's see what you brought....</p>

          <p>Uh, no. No, it won't. I did tell you I needed [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Q21248]s, didn't I?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't just pump Aether into this thing to make it go. I need an external power source.</p>

          <p>It's only a matter of time before those warmongering Balaur come to reclaim this place. You can't delay.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I hate to admit it, but the Balaur make some pretty nice stuff. This thing's damage potential way outstrips the Drana used to power it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which is good, in this case. It means that it should meet the armor's power needs, and then some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The armor's already mostly complete. I just need to make some connections.... I'll just be a few minutes....</p>
