          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank Aion you're here, [%username]. I was starting to lose hope that I would find a Sorcerer capable of completing this task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can use Greater Stigma, right?</p>

          <p>I knew you wouldn't disappoint, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple of Wisdom just issued an official statement encouraging the use of Greater Stigma, and provided me with a handful of new Greater Stigma for Sorcerers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Problem is...the temple wants to see results, and I'm not comfortable issuing these Greater Stigma to Sorcerers who wouldn't use them to their full potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think in your capable hands though, the temple would see that Sorcerers are worthy of the reward. What do you say--think you can impress a few bureaucrats?</p>

          <p>Hah! I could be issuing an impossible suicide mission, and yet you've already agreed. Either you've got nerves of steel, or you know I'm not that devious.... I hope it's the former, for my reputation's sake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For a Sorcerer like you, this should be easier than heating a pot of water. I need you to master a Greater Stigma skill. Let's see...how about ***?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use *** 10 times, and the temple should be satisfied that this Greater Stigma skill won't be wasted on some dullard with no idea how to cast.</p>

          <p>Very well...I would have asked you to cast it here, but I was worried that something might...explode. Then High Priest Agehia would be breathing down my neck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this, direct from the Temple of Wisdom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you use it to crush the Balaur and the Elyos. Don't let it go to waste.</p>
