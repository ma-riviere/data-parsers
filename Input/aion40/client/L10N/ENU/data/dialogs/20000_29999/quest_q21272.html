          <p>An Asmodian Daeva bears a great many things on his shoulders: eternal life, the pressures of war, tremendous responsibility.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But not once do those shoulders bow or buckle. They support not only the Daeva's own life, but the lives of all Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In this way, we all support each other, and our world. It is an unbreakable system that the Elyos will never breach, or even comprehend.</p>

          <p>But their arrogance also keeps them from realizing just how weak they are. So they continue to strut and preen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Veille, minion of Kaisinel, is one of the worst. She believes not in the power of Asmodian strength-- indeed, she mocks it by her every action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even now, as Asmodae marches on her stronghold, she believes she is unstoppable, that she alone will turn back the tide.</p>
