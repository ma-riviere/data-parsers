          <p>No idea why village wants a bell tower, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine walking through lovely village square, watching birds flying overhead and listening to gentle rush of new fountain. Peace and calm, and then BONG! BONG! BONG! BIRDS DROP DEAD! GROUND STARTS SHAKING! PEOPLE START RUNNING WITH THEIR HANDS OVER EARS, OTHERS HIDE UNDER PILLOWS SCREAMING "WHY? WHY DID WE BUILD STUPID BELL TOWER?!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahem. Got a bit carried away there Daeva. But you get message, yes yes?</p>
