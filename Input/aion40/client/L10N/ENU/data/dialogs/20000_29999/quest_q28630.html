          <p>Wait a second, [%username]. You're not going to wear that Kromede's Flame around your neck, are you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What a waste. You could use it to coat the Dagger of the Judge to improve its performance. If you wanted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But maybe you don't. Forget I said anything....</p>

          <p>What you need is three things. The Dagger of the Judge, Kromede's Flame, and a talented smith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first one I can tell you how to get, pretty easily. The second you already have. And the third thing? Hmmm....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now where will we find a talented blacksmith? I wonder....</p>

          <p>You're right! I am indeed a talented smith. So it seems all we lack is the Dagger of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately for you, I heard that you can find it with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>So just pop off there, grab the Dagger and come back. Should take, what, five minutes?</p>

          <p>That was meant rhetorically. In case you hadn't noticed, I happen to be a pretty capable smith.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>I once created a dagger so beautiful that the owner refused to accept it, because he wasn't worthy to carry it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I eventually sold it, or I'd show you. You'll just have to take me at my word.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't weep for Kromede.... She's been taken over by grief and hate. She doesn't deserve your compassion anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just hand over the Dagger of the Judge and Kromede's Flame, and we'll get to work.</p>

          <p>I might need some extra ingredients. I'll need you to go to Elysea and gather 100 Weapon Fluxes and the heart of an Elim...</p>

          <p>Nah, I'm just kidding. Here's Kromede's Dagger. Enjoy it!</p>
