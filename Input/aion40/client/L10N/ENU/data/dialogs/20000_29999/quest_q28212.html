          <p>Normally, you would speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Reigar] to get your ticket, but I can give you your first one to start out.</p>

          <p>Now, I know what you're thinking: I'll go right to the Arena of Chaos and show him what I'm made of. Better Daevas than you have thought the same way, and we just got done sponging them off the arena floor.</p>

          <p>I'm not going to stop you walking in there, though. I'm not your babysitter. Just be sure to check the name on the arena door before entering.</p>
