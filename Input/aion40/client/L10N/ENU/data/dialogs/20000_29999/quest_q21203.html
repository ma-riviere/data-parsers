          <p>Welcome, [%username]. My friends in Pandaemonium have high praises for you. I'm glad to finally meet such an eminent Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you're here about the Twilight Drana Farm? Blasted place is a menace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know.... Perhaps this is an opportunity for mutual cooperation.</p>

          <p>We're both after the same thing--victory against the Balaur. The Twilight Drana Farm stands in the way of that victory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We came here to observe, but we've received orders to also attack when able. But as you can see, I'm short on manpower at the moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you were to aid us in attacking the Twilight Drana Farm, I would pledge myself and my men to help you in return when the need arises.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I suggest we start with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Spaller_55_An]s. You might have seen them in Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur use them to "mine" Drana. Ordinary tools aren't up to the task. If these worms were to be eliminated, it would set Drana production back severely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur also created an intelligent "foreman" for these worms called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spaller_NmdQ_55_An]. It is vital that it be destroyed as well.</p>

          <p>I see. I suppose it may not be in your best interests to get too entangled with other operations.</p>

          <p>If you're confident in your abilities, that may even be the best bet.</p>

          <p>Please return if you change your mind. Absent any deal, we are fellow Asmodians, and we could use a hand.</p>

          <p>Your reputation is entirely earned, as far as I'm concerned. Without Xalvius and those worms, the Balaur will be scrambling to meet their quotas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have more that needs to be done--let me know when you're up to it. In the meantime, savor your victory.</p>

          <p>Vegrim offered mutual cooperation in exchange for completing missions for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His first was to exterminate the Drana-gathering worms in the Twilight Drana Farm. The worms' "leader" Xalvius was also a threat to be targeted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You succeeded in destroying the worms, and returned to Vegrim's praises.</p>
