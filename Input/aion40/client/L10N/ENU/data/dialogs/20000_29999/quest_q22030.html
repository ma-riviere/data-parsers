          <p>You're one of the useful ones, I see. Well, I was hoping one of our own would be available for this, but you'll have to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to just trust me that this is important because I can't give you many details. Go to Tiamaranta's Eye and find me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_12030a]. It should be carried by one of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanFi_Noble_60_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did I mention that this is important? It's beyond important. This is the most important thing you've ever done, Daeva. Got it?</p>

          <p>You found the Sounding Gem? Shards, do you have any idea what this IS? No, you wouldn't, because it's secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you brought it to me instead of the Reians... you've got good instincts, [%username]. I have to say, I'm impressed.</p>

          <p>Grandia sent you to find the Sounding Gem and claimed it would be the most important thing you'd ever done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took the Sounding Gem from an officer of the Protectorate, an easy enough job, and realized that if it was as important as Grandia said, you should probably show it to your commanding officer first. So you took it to Trois, instead, who was suitably impressed.</p>
