          <p>I have a bit of a problem, [%username]. It's partly a political problem, and I hate dealing with politics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may know, Kahrun's Will has weakened around Gurriki territory, so more Daevas have been sent there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One was seriously injured there recently, the daughter of a high ranking Pandaemonium general. She's been demanding "answers" of us ever since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, we can solve this with a little bloodshed, by killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuFi_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuWi_57_An]s. Can you do this for me?</p>

          <p>While you were gone, I got another missive from the general, wanting to know what's being done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please tell me I have something to tell her!</p>

          <p>Finally! Now I can get back to work without being bothered by messengers every day! At least until the next time she gets impatient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better yet, the general's daughter is recovering nicely. She should be back on the front lines very soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahh, this is the best day I've had in a while, and it's all thanks to you, [%username]!</p>

          <p>Asraphis was getting grief from a Pandaemonium general whose daughter, a Daeva, was harmed by the Gurriki.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you slew Gurriki Warriors and Gurriki Shamans in Gurriki Swamp so the general would be placated and leave Asraphis alone.</p>
