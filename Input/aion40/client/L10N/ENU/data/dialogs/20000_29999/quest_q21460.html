          <p>You know, I went inside Taloc once. Just once, though. I haven't been affected like other Daevas, but it did make me quite sick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw the oddest thing inside, though: a Shulack. He seemed to be living there. In fact, he tried to sell me something.</p>

          <p>I didn't have a lot of Kinah, so I didn't even really look at what he was selling. I think he was disappointed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I also wasn't sure if I was hallucinating the whole thing to begin with--I'd been feeling ill for a while by then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lately though, I've been thinking about him again, and I've come to the conclusion that he was real.</p>

          <p>His name was...something like...Doris? No, Doria? Wait, it was [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shulack_Elim_1]! If you ever return to Taloc, can you find this Dorkin and ask about his life?</p>
