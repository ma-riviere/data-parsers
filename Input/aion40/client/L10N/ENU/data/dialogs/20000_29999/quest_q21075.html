          <p>Actually, [%username], now that I've seen that you understand love, I want to ask you for another favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've decided to marry Misorin. I know, we've known each other for such a short time, but...she's the one. I know it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I hired famed designer Marra to make a dress just for her. It was hideously expensive, but worth every Kinah.</p>

          <p>I can't leave Gelkmaros without orders. But I don't want the dress delivered either. It's so expensive, it might get stolen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the best option is to have someone retrieve it for me. It's certainly the fastest option.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you have to do is go to Pandaemonium, pick it up, and deliver it to Misorin. She knows about the dress, but not my intentions...yet.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mione] is, of course, one of the designers working out of Vanahal Boutique. Just tell her I sent you.</p>

          <p>It's funny, though. Women's tastes are very alike. The dress Misorin wanted is a lot like the one Lusena...</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I was devastated at first. But I'm an Asmodian, so I instead became determined to get revenge. As if Aion heard my anguish, I too ascended. I changed my name and appearance, and began seducing him. When his happiness is at its peak...I'll crush his soul! Utterly!</p>

          <p>Don't tell him any of this, I beg you. This is justice, pure and simple, and I know he disgusts you as much as he does me.</p>
