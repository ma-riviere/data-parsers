          <p>Finally. The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Sadonix] is ready, and we are ready.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today will be remembered for all time, [%username]. Our children will celebrate Tiamat's death for millenia. Moments like these are not common.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, your place is secured on the great ship. You will have a front seat as Tiamaranta's walls crumble under the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Sadonix]' cannons. [%dic:STR_DIC_DF4_Shipworker] will grant you access to her, if you're ready to depart.</p>

          <p>No! All our planning... everything is lost!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that was Tiamat--the weakest of the Dragon Lords! He destroyed our forces in moments. How... how could we ever hope to destroy the Dragon Lords?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Reian fleet hadn't shown up when it did, we'd likely have lost the Sadonics too. I suppose we should thank... wait... what's the noise?</p>

          <p>We all know of your struggles. Of your perpetual war, your absolute resentment of the Elyos. But... naive as we apparently were, we had hoped that you would set aside your differences to fight an overwhelmingly powerful common enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You all saw what [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA52] did to your forces, and yet you still rage at each other. Remarkable...</p>

         <p>Yes. I realize that it would be the uneasiest of truces, but there is no other way. The Asmodians must work with the Elyos if they are to survive and overcome the Balaur threat.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>I will not allow further fighting between your people and the Elyos on Reian soil. Any trangressions will be met with overwhelming force.</p>

         <p>Now, if all that's understood, I'll send you to the Habrok. I want you to deliver my message to your superiors. Understood?</p>

          <p>Ugh. The worst thing about listening to Reians is that more often than not, they're right. We clearly lack the firepower to fight Tiamat. But siding with the Elyos? Just the thought of it boils my blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one has even dared suggest a truce between the Asmodians and Elyos before. Perhaps Kahrun, separated as he is from our hatred, can see potential where we cannot.</p>

          <p>I... I want to talk to him. Face to face. If this is an Elyos trick....</p>

          <p>Vidar ordered a grand assault on Tiamaranta's walls. His intention was to defeat the Balaur there and finally kill one of the Dragon Lords. You traveled with the strike force aboard the Sadonics, a powerful warship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, disaster soon struck. Tiamat himself emerged and fought back against the invading forces. His power was unimaginable, and the Asmodian forces were soon scattered. Annihilation was imminent, but then a fleet commanded by the Reian Leader Kahrun appeared and rescued the countless Asmodian daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun forbade fights between the Elyos and Asmodians on his land, and tried to persuade you that this was the time to work alongside the Elyos, and not against them. You took his message to Marchutan's Agent Aimah, who saw reason in his words and informed you that she wished to talk to him directly.</p>
