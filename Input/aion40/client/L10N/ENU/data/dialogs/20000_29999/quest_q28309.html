          <p>Those poor Shulacks, caught in a cycle of slavish devotion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without the Dredgion Generators, the Surkana's energy would fly out of control.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet they tend it with such care. Pouring their energy into Tiamat's hold.</p>

          <p>Shulacks are not like us, Asmodians and Reians. We would not live long in true slavery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So let's help the Shulacks to help themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see what happens when all five [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDStation_FOBJ_TOWER1]s fail and they have no power to draw on for repairs.</p>

          <p>Hariken tells me that the most senior [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_18309all_1] come whenever disaster calls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus, should you attack a generator, one of these leaders would arrive to defend it, giving you the chance to dispose of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without leaders to guide their steps, the other Shulacks may begin to think more critically.</p>

          <p>I should ask Hariken if he's noticed any change in their behavior since your thoughtful destruction.</p>

          <p>Thank you for bringing such wonderful news of freedom and victory. Please, take this.</p>

          <p>Rifon contemplated the nature of Shulack oppression by the Balaur and then asked you to kill the Shulacks who manage the Dredgion Generators in the Aturam Sky Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You attacked the generators, then fought the craftsmen who came to save them.</p>
