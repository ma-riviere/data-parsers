          <p>The hard part is the watching, and the waiting. Knowing that at any moment, those blasted Balaur could burst through with fury straight out of the Abyss.</p>

          <p>The periods of quiet are always tense--you're always anticipating the quiet's sudden and violent end.</p>

          <p>But you look like you've been through what I'm talking about already. Am I right?</p>

          <p>I knew it. I know strength when I see it. In fact, I need to borrow yours.</p>

          <p>A scholar named Ightris asked me to send her fish found in the Viscum Swamp for study. I swear! She did--it wasn't just an excuse to go fishing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Balaur attacked this post, and I returned in such haste, I left behind the fish and my fishing poles. Could you find them for me?</p>

          <p>I knew you'd accept! My [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_21200] should still be in Viscum Swamp. The buckets are especially important, since they contain all the fish I caught.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why did I have more than one rod? Well, no one rod can catch all kinds of fish. They have different weights and maneuvers you have to take into account.</p>

          <p>Look, I know it sounds silly for me to ask a Daeva to get fish and fishing poles, but it really is important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ightris's studies could tell us a lot about this region--maybe how to gain an advantage over the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I suppose if you're afraid of Viscum Swamp, that's okay. I'll just find some other braver Daeva....</p>

          <p>Lucal went to catch fish living in the Viscum Swamp at the request of Ightris. Because of a Balaur raid, he had to rush back, leaving his fishing rods and the fish behind. He asked you to retrieve them for him.</p>

          <p>When you brought the fishing rod sand the buckets of fish back from Viscum Swamp, he was relieved to find that nothing was broken or missing.</p>
