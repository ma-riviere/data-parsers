          <p>I've been having problems getting recruits to come here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are lots of Balaur to fight, to be sure, but some just aren't comfortable seeing Elyos and not being able to fight them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's understandable, but it's giving [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jeita] some manpower problems. Think you could help her out on a major assignment?</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]! Berner told me to expect you. My problem is the Basrasa Legion Garrison. If we're going to take it down, we need to weaken it first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanFi_Tiamat_59_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanSc_Tiamat_59_Ae]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanWi_Tiamat_59_Ae]es, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanCl_Tiamat_59_Ae]s are our biggest problems. We need them wiped out.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Let's see those grumpy Reians complain about misdirected violence now.</p>

          <p>Maybe inviting them for a feast will smooth things over. Oh, I can almost see the menu now....</p>
