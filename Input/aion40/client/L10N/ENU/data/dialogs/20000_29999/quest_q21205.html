          <p>Blast these Balaur! I'll cut them open and wear their entrails as necklaces!</p>

          <p>I know, I know... I wouldn't really do it. But the cowards have been sending Drakies to steal supplies from our camp!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's basic guerilla warfare--cut off the enemy's supplies to weaken them. But I never thought the clever devils would do it to us!</p>

          <p>In love and war, [%username], though a true Asmodian only has passion for the latter. I hope Arango heard that. He keeps glancing at me when he should be...THINKING OF WAYS TO CRUSH OUR ENEMIES!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure he heard THAT. Anyway, as much as I'd like to march up to the Balaur barracks and cut out their hearts, I've got a better idea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We raid their supplies, and give them a taste of their own tactics. What do you say, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Yes! If we raid them, we can not only replenish our own coffers, but weaken our enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Vorgaltem Battlefield and nab the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Box_Q21205], but be careful.</p>

          <p>Let's see what's in these supplies now. Ugh...this smells foul, this looks...mostly edible, this is...gross! It's all slimy!</p>
