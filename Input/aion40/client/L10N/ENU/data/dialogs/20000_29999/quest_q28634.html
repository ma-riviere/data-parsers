          <p>Wait, [%username]. What are you going to do with that? No, not that. THAT. Kromede's Flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You were going to wear it as a necklace, weren't you? Admit it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a better option. You can use it as a coating to improve the Spear of the Judge.</p>

          <p>It's a long and involved process, but I think I can pull it off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The gist of it is this: you bring me Kromede's Flame and the Spear of the Judge, and I can fuse the two of them together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I can't get the Spear of the Judge for you. You'll have to get that yourself.</p>

          <p>The Spear of the Judge is a highly precise item, and it's likely to snap if it's not improved like I suggest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But before we can do anything, we need the Spear of the Judge, don't we?</p> 
          <p> </p>	
          <p>I believe that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] has it in the Fire Temple. At least, that's what people are saying.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, you're just in time! The forge has reached just the right temperature. If we're even one degree off, it will destroy both items forever.</p>

          <p>Listen, once I made a spear for a Daeva of Flame that was so well-balanced he threw it all the way to Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, that's not true, but it's a good story. You want your own stories to tell, you come back to me with the Spear of the Judge and Kromede's Flame in your Cube. Understand?</p>
