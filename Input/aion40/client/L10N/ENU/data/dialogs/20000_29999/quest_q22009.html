          <p>We Reians were once one in spirit. We acted as one, spoke as one, and fought as one. We were monolith, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's all changed now. We have seen our Reians brothers and sisters desert us, tempted by the power of the Balaur. Such treachery cannot be tolerated. They must be killed, but our laws forbid us from killing our kin, no matter their degree of wrongdoing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm turning to you, [%username]. Please, go to the Traitors' Stronghold, and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_YunAs_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_YunPr_58_An]s there.</p>

          <p>Thank you for helping us, [%username]. Each one of those deserters is a parent or child to those of us who remained faithful. The difficulty in facing them down, even after all they've done, cannot be overstated.</p>
