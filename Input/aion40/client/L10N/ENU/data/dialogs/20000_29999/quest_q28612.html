          <p>Say, [%username], there's something I didn't tell you about Kromede's Tear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a nice necklace, sure, but the materials I made to use it are special.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have a special connection to a weapon wielded by Kromede herself.</p>

          <p>It's hard to explain, really. But the weapon I'm talking about is the Tome of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I smelt Kromede's Tear and use it to reinforce the spellbook's cover and bindings, the book's power will increase significantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you already have the necklace, all you need to do is get the Tome of the Judge. Sound like a good deal?</p>

          <p>You can't imagine how relieved I am to hear that. This'll be the project that cements my reputation as Asmodae's greatest blacksmith!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The last hitch is the Tome of the Judge. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae], the real Kromede, still has it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's made the Fire Temple in Morheim her hideout. Be careful--just because you saw the truth doesn't mean she'll like you.</p>

          <p>The necklace may be useful, but I don't think you understand what the Tome of the Judge will be like after I'm done with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I can do it, too. Just ask any of the Daevas of Fire, and they'll give you the truth.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>

          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>

          <p>Hey, you don't have to fib to me! I can take the truth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know a Tome of the Judge doesn't sound like the kind of thing a smith would handle, but in this case, trust me, it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can handle delicate objects like books, no problem. All you have to do is find it in your heart to trust me. Oh, and get the Tome of the Judge, along with Kromede's Tear, then make sure they're both in your Cube when we talk.</p>
