          <p>It was like Aion himself smiled at me. I went weak, and all I could hear was her melodious voice....</p>

          <p>Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Misorin]. What a lovely name. It's like a whisper from the divine. Mis...o...rin.</p>

          <p>I wasn't the only one to notice her, though. I knew that from the start. Blasted lovesick fools.</p>

          <p>But strength wins out in the end. It always does. She came to see that I was the best man for her.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Nowadays it feels like I could fly without spreading my wings.</p>
