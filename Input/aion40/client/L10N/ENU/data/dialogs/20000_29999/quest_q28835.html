          <p>It's odd--Guestblooms are in practically every home in Pernon, yet we know so little about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm particularly fascinated in how they react when treated with fertilizer--and from guests, no less!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I even understand that they sprout, but the horticulturalists snap them all up before I can get any.</p>

          <p>Oh! It... it truly is a Guestbloom sprout! And I can have this?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so beautiful. And being able to study its life cycle from the beginning will make a wonderful addition to my research.</p>

          <p>This is very generous of you. Azphel bless you!</p>
