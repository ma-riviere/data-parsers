          <p>Remarkable is a word that I don't bandy around freely, but something happened earlier that genuinely warrants the term.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A man dressed as a Lepharist Revolutionary calling himself [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Philmoi] strolled up to our front gates and demanded entry. We're at war with their group, but he was unarmed, so we let him in. He spoke briefly, and then left, just like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Lord Lephar wishes to meet the [%userclass] named [%username]. [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_01]." That's all he said. You could be walking into a trap, but this could lead to something... ha, remarkable.</p>

          <p>First, we're skipping through grass fields with the Elyos, now [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lephar] wants to meet us? Next thing, we'll be off camping with the Dragon Lords and roasting Sparkie wings together over crackling campfires.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you came to me for permission or advice? If it's the former, you don't need it; if it's the latter, then there's no harm in hearing what he has to say. Just don't forget your weapon.</p>

          <p>You're later than we expected, [%username]. There are steps that you must complete before you can meet with Lord Lephar, now. These steps would not have been required had you been more timely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see the [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_FOBJ_Q10051] behind me? Lephar created it as a tool that would allow you to reach him, but its powers have weakened since it was crafted. However, all is not lost. It can be recharged with a little Shulack know-how.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Head to Menin Village, and you'll see members of a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_20051all] there. They each carry a portable [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_20051A] that I can use on Lord Lephar's creation. Now, if you're ready...</p>

          <p>I am Lephar. I am Israphel. I do not have the time to explain what has gone before, so please, listen to what I have to tell you. These are pressing times. My presence alone validates that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Siel's Relics, the ones that Tiamat controls, are far, far more than a mere weapon. You have already suffered at his hands. I saw your assault.</p>

          <p>Tiamat is being empowered by Siel's Relics, [%username]. With each passing day, he learns how to unlock greater powers from within them. If he is not stopped soon, then Atreia itself will fall. The Relics are the key, child. That is the message I wanted to convey to you.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we must part ways. I cannot keep this place secure forever, and you have work to do. Tell your superiors. They will listen to you.</p>

          <p>Kutos told you about a Lepharist Revolutionary, Philmoni, who had walked into the Kahrun guard Headquarters and left a message. It was short and simple and stated that Lephar was looking for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You met with Philmoni and used a Mysterious Orb to take you to Lephar. On your arrival, you discovered a shocking truth: that Lord Lephar was in fact the Empyrean Lord Israphel, thought dead for thousands of years. Israphel passed on a warning to you, that Atreia would fall unless Siel's Relics were taken from Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You left and told Aimah what had happened. She was understandably startled but promised to look into the matter.</p>
