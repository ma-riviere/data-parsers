          <p>I like the Black Cloud Traders. They're clever, tough little guys. But something about the Lapilimas really freaks them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time one comes near the camp, they start squealing. That youngest female climbed right up my skirt to get away from it! Have you ever had a terrified Shugo cling to your face? They have claws!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've no idea why the Lapilimas upset them so much. Who knows what goes on in the mind of a Shugo? I would be terribly grateful if you could clear out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Flyingworm_59_An] around here, [%username].</p>

          <p>Ugh, that's a relief.</p>

          <p>The little one, Spirinrinerk, actually asked me if she could sleep under my bed last night. For Aion's sake!</p>

          <p>Amodena was losing patience with the Black Cloud Shugos after they suddenly decided they were terrified of Icicle Lapilimas and that she was the only one who could protect them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed the Icicle Lapilimas, and Amodena rewarded you for bringing her a measure of peace.</p>
