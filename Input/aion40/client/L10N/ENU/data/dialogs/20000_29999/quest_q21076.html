          <p>Aaagh! Not another bee sting! My blasted bad luck's struck again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, [%username], the bees are back. Did you expect anything else with my luck? I'm back in my armor all day every day again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since they were bred by the Balaur, I've been consulting with Herka on my own time, if only for my own safety and sanity.</p>

          <p>She said that, like normal bees, as long as there are any queens alive, the hive will eventually reform.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why there are [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_BeeNest_Q21017]s everywhere again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With my luck, I'd be armored in bees within ten seconds. Could you destroy the hives again for me?</p>

          <p>That's a huge relief! Hopefully you remember where the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_BeeNest_Q21017]s were in Antagor Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to kill the queens to really solve the problem. But for now, this is the best we can do, if only to reduce their numbers.</p>

          <p>Only eight stings since you were gone! That's a huge improvement over the past few days.</p>

          <p>I bought this ointment from a Shulack merchant that's supposed to ease the pain, but it just seems to attract more bees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, it works for everyone else. But still, it seems you took care of the hives?</p>
