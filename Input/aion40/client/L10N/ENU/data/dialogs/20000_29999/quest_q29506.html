          <p>Cleric, heal this! Cleric, heal that! By Aion's grace, Clerics have such a thankless job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can relate, no doubt, [%username]. I'm sure that you've encountered more than your fair share of ingrates in your travels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But as luck would have it, Clerics are being honored by the Temple of Destiny. In fact, I've just received a new shipment of Greater Stigma from the temple, and I'm looking to distribute it amongst the Clerics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know how to use Greater Stigma, right, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent! Well, these Greater Stigma aren't just for any Cleric that happens to ask. I only have a limited amount, so I'm looking for the most deserving.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure you know that it's not enough to just learn a skill--you have to engrave it into your mind. In the heat of battle, you act and react on instinct, or you wind up at the Obelisk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd be happy to reward you with one of these Greater Stigma, but first, are you up for a little task to demonstrate your commitment?</p>

          <p>That shouldn't be too difficult for a Cleric of your talent.</p>
