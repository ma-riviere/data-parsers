          <p>Now all I need to do is get these Aether Samples to Pandaemonium for study. I was given a material analysis kit, but it's not nearly sophisticated enough for this job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aether can change quickly, so this needs to get to Pandaemonium before the Samples degrade.</p>

          <p>Hmm, I'm afraid I have a problem. Chairman Vellun is expecting research results any day now, and has asked me to stick around until they're done so I can deliver them at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm getting impatient, but orders are orders. So if those Samples are as unstable as you say, it's probably better for you to deliver them yourself.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Very interesting.... If this Aether did come from creatures around the Aether Generator, no wonder it was malfunctioning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These samples are producing counter-harmonics that upset delicate Aether balances, probably due to the effects of Drana.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Hmph, Fjoersvith. Infuriating woman. But she's extremely intelligent, and usually right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I suppose Moynai was more correct this time. Good--Riati was winning too much lately. Competition keeps them on their toes.</p>

          <p>Now to set them on figuring out ways to stabilize Aetheric Fields. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first stop was Mialan, but the messenger told you that she was being held back by Vellun, so you took the Samples to Fjoersvith yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She told you that the Aetheric energy being given off by the local creatures was the cause of the Aether Generator malfunctioning.</p>

          <p>You reported her findings to Vellun, who decided to research ways to counteract the energy, and thanked you for your work.</p>
