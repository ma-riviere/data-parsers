          <p>You know, [%username], I've always wondered...what kind of Ranger can't summon a few wild creatures to come to their aid in battle?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, of course a Ranger of your talent wouldn't need them.... But I mean, it would just make sense...you know...in the grand scheme of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to have a little Elroco come rest on my shoulder...and then attack my enemies with vicious fangs!</p>

          <p>That's probably for the best. I suppose it's just a pipe dream--I wonder where that thought even came from?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I have good news for Rangers like you! The Temple of Death recently sent out an official notice supporting the use of Greater Stigma, and sent me a number of them to distribute amongst our finest Rangers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the Temple of Death's larger purpose is to fund the deaths of Balaur and Elyos in Balaurea--a purpose I wholeheartedly support. Are you interested in earning a Greater Stigma, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent. I knew you wouldn't refuse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now then, the Temple of Death wants to distribute them to the Daevas who actually use their Greater Stigma skills in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you were to use ***...oh, I don't know...10 times? I think the Temple of Death would be satisfied. Do that, and I'll reward you with a new Greater Stigma.</p>

          <p>You must be busy...or lazy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, come back if you change your mind. The Greater Stigma is well worth the minimal effort.</p>

          <p>Great to hear, [%username]. Though I suppose I have no way of knowing if you really did it.... But I can take your word for it.</p>

          <p>Here, take this Greater Stigma, and may it serve you well.</p>

          <p>If you have time, I'm sure the Temple of Death would appreciate you heading to Gelkmaros and using that Greater Stigma to further the war effort.</p>
