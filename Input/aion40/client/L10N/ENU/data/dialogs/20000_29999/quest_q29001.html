          <p>You were once just another apt pupil, [%username]. But now I imagine you could teach me a thing or two!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most who attain the level of Expert have studied Essencetapping for years. I never thought anyone, let alone a pupil of mine, would become an Expert so quickly.</p>

          <p>Well first, the master names the student as an Expert and writes them a letter of recommendation to be delivered to High Priest Agehia. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the High Priest will need to give her approval, and after that it'll be official.</p>
