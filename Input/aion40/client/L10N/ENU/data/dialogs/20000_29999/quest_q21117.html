          <p>At the same time, you wonder if we are a threat. I understand that concern too. It is natural, as unpleasant as it is.</p>

          <p>Of course not. But we have suffered much worse than mere suspicion--worse than most Asmodians can ever imagine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we chose this path, and so we walk it with dignity. It is a concept I'm sure you Asmodians understand.</p>

          <p>But even my dignity is shaken when I see the ghosts of the past. I mean literal ghosts--old comrades killed by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some still walk as restless spirits, deprived of their rightful place in the Aether. I cannot bear to see them suffer, yet I cannot bear to release them.</p>
