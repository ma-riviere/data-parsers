          <p>Mastarius and Lord Marchutan extend their congratualions and thanks to you and to all the other Daevas who participated in the defense of Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without you, the outcome of the battle might have been different. With you, the outcome was as inevitable as fate.</p>

          <p>Your courage and strength are an example to all Asmodians. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your success leads me to ask that you serve your people once again.</p>

          <p>The Elyos are demoralized and scattered. We must press our advantage and invade Inggison. We will succeed where they failed.</p>

          <p>Still, try not to take too much time. We must strike while the iron is hot, and I'll approach another Daeva if necessary.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Mace.</p>
