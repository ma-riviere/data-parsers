          <p>You know, [%username], Kromede's Tear may be a mighty fine necklace, but you can't kill a Drakan with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But thanks to the materials it's made with, it has a special connection to one of Kromede's weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I have to do is put the two together, and you have a force to be reckoned with!</p>

          <p>Right. The Dagger of the Judge is the weapon I'm talking about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alone, they're powerful enough. But put them together, and the result will take you to new heights!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you have to do is get the Dagger of the Judge, and I'll do the rest! What do you think?</p>

          <p>I was hoping you'd say that! This'll prove to the world that I'm one of the top smiths in Asmodae!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the Dagger of the Judge, the real [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] has it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's at the Fire Temple in Morheim. It may be a bit weird for you, but you can do it.</p>

          <p>Yeah, that is a mighty pretty necklace, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But "pretty" isn't worth a shard these days. Now, "strong"...that's where it's at!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Dagger of the Judge together with Kromede's Tear is strong! You should think it over.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>

          <p>Did she have the Dagger of the Judge like I said? If so, I can start the process.</p>

          <p>You obtained the dagger and gave it to him, along with Kromede's Tear. Walter fused the two and gave you a strengthened weapon, Kromede's Dagger.</p>
