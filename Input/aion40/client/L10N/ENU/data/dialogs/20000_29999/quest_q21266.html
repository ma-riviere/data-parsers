          <p>Ah, it's the hero of the hour! Well, there are many such heroes, but your contribution cannot be denied.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mastarius himself has spoken very highly of you and the others. Did you know he remembers each and every one of your names?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those names are being spread throughout Asmodae. I expect you'll be buried in accolades and honors soon.</p>

          <p>I know--we're all doing this for Asmodae. But surely you can accept a few congratulations, can't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or perhaps you'd prefer another mission? We want to take advantage of this Elyos defeat and invade Inggison.</p>

          <p>If you take this task, I have a reward that will enhance the power of your Sword.</p>

          <p>I had a feeling you'd accept. You're much like me: finding purpose and reward on the field of battle, rather than some banquet hall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need you to kill the Guardian Generals of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll be in the middle of enemy territory, but that's the whole point of the invasion. I know you won't let us down.</p>

          <p>But I expect your work there was exhausting. If only the scholars could come up with something to give Daevas as much energy as they have living years.</p>

          <p>You've done admirably. If the Elyos and Balaur aren't worried right now, they're even more foolish than I thought.</p>

          <p>They won't be cowed easily, though. We must all contribute if we're to win this war and save our world.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Sword.</p>
