          <p>Are you here to exchange your manastones, Daeva? News travels fast up here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did we transact before? Forgive me, it's been busy lately. But I suppose a good deal is a good deal in any land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Union rules state that I must inform you of where these might end up... but they're more like guidelines, so let's just move on. Are we trading today?</p>

          <p>Okay, listen up, Daeva. I see you wear the attire of a [%userclass], so you'll know what I'm talking about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a very angry client in need of MP +70, Evasion +14, and Parry +22 manastones. Where they're going isn't technically legal, so I only want these in bundles of 10. They're easier to move that way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I need to take them across the Balaurian border tonight, so I'll treat you well if you have them. Or can get them... by any means necessary.</p>

          <p>That's not going to work for me at all, Daeva. I have clients--big, angry, funny-talking clients--who aren't going to like me showing up empty-handed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can get your hands on 10 old MP +70, Evasion +14, or Parry +22 manastones, I'll set you up with a bunch of manastones so new they'll shine like gold.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got some new military-grade manastones direct from Pandaemonium to give you for these old ones here. That should make it worth your while.</p>
