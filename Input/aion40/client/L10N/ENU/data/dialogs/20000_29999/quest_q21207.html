          <p>It's just a few of us here, and the Balaur are relentless.</p>

          <p>Arango bothers me as well. I keep catching his furtive glances, and sometimes I hear him whispering poems to himself.... I think he's got a thing for me, but I'm only interested in stopping the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, we need help to keep from being overrun. You up to the challenge, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I received a scouting report that said the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q21207]s are planning an attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take them out, and it's possible you will have prevented our demise. Just don't venture in too deep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you slay the Drakan, take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21207a]s as proof, and bring them back. It'll also help disarm the survivors.</p>
