          <p>Ugh, yet another mission I have to delegate. This command business is dull as a Kobold's eyeball. Yeah, I get to shout at people a bit but is that enough?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I really want is to set off this Sounding Gem at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_TDown_ItemUseArea_Q22031A] and then follow it. But you're going to do it for me because apparently I'm too important to do menial tasks like reconnaisance and good old-fashioned Balaur evisceration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't tell you why this is so important. Not yet--you're not senior enough. That's one benefit of my position, I guess. All you're supposed to know is that there's a rift forming there that leads to something important in Tiamaranta's Eye. Something VERY important, get it? So go do it, and for shard's sake, don't screw it up.</p>

          <p>Ha! I knew it. That's why that sector is under such heavy guard. Yes, it's obvious once you know it's there.</p>

          <p>The entrance to Tiamat Stronghold.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I told you it was good, didn't I? Well, there's one more part of this mission, [%username], and that's holding our tongues and our tempers until the order comes down to move in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work. Now don't do anything to give it away.</p>

          <p>Trois sent you to activate the Sounding Gem on the Uncanny Road. He couldn't give you more specific details although he emphasized its importance. You did as ordered and followed the path that the Sounding Gem illuminated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you reported the location to Trois, he finally filled you in: you'd discovered the entrance to Tiamat Stronghold, which must remain secret for the time being.</p>
