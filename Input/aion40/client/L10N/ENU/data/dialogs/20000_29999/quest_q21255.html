          <p>I can see you're wondering how the Piece of Zikel works. I'm afraid I haven't the foggiest idea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that it's a piece of extremely concentrated Aether, further empowered by the touch of Lord Zikel himself. But who knows if that's true?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not all weapons can handle it. Only specially made ones, like the Bow I gave you, have a prayer of staying intact in its presence.</p>

          <p>It is, isn't it? It also takes another special set of skills to combine this Bow with the Piece, if you don't want to destroy either or both.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, I know someone with such skills: Usener. Perhaps you've met her in Pandaemonium?</p>

          <p>Be warned. This is delicate work, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener] will almost certainly not help you for free.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, Kinah is for spending, as the Shugo say. Especially when it aids you in saving Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowing this, will you still consult with her?</p>

          <p>A wise choice. You should at least find out what her demands are, then decide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I know of no one else who can accomplish what needs to be done. I'm afraid you may have little choice in this matter.</p>

          <p>Pity. I think that Bow would have served you even better with the Piece of Zikel's power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it would've been worthwhile to find out what Usener would ask from you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But maybe your own strength will be sufficient to overcome the gap.</p>

          <p>It'll cost 8,000,000 Kinah in all. Do you still want me to do this?</p>

          <p>And I was looking forward to this, too! Shards! Well, I'll still be here when you have the Kinah.... Please hurry. And when you get back, that bow of yours needs to be sitting pretty in your Cube, not your hands.</p>

          <p>With that in mind, you brought the Bow and the Piece of Zikel to Usener in Pandaemonium. She fused the two together and gave you an empowered Bow.</p>
