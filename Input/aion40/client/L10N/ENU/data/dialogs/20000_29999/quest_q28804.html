          <p>Although I'm managing Tezz's House, I've long dreamt of having my own home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to buy a house in Apex State, but the houses are so very expensive. So I decided to buy one in Arcada State and made a bid for a house at auction. However, I've heard nothing from Sarara yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you see Sarara, who works in the Resedential Shopping Area just northwest of here, please ask her if I've won my bid for a new home.</p>

          <p>Shadows soothe you, [%username], you seem concerned about something. Are you having trouble with a home you've bought? I've traded houses all my life, but none of them had any problems!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or are you going to try to buy me off to get a popular house?</p>

          <p>Again? That Karenon's as feather-brained as a fluffed up Qooqoo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry, but the house Karenon made a bid for was already auctioned off to another bidder. He knows that he has to bid higher than the minimum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just like any other auction, the highest bid always wins. </p>
