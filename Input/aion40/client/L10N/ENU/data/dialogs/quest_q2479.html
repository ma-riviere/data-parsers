          <p>As an Asmodian Daeva, I really shouldn't say this to you...but the urgency of the situation leaves me no choice. The time has come to take action!</p>

          <p>You see, there are Elim in Elysea as well. But the Elim there aren't suffering from the same problems, since Elysea gets much more sunlight.</p>
