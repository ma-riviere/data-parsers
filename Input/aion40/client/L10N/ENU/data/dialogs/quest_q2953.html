          <p>This has to be the busiest teleporter in all of Atreia, [%username]. But since I see everyone who comes and goes through this gate, the younger Daevas treat me like a message service! "Oh, if you see such-and-such, would you tell him this..."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I swear they'd pin notes to me if they could. Do I look like a social secretary to you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, some messages I don't mind taking, like when the messengers drop off requests from our troops for supplies. Those, I'm happy to pass on. They all go to Veldina in the Temple of Gold.</p>

        	<p>Well, at first I'd drop off a whole bunch of supply requests with Veldina when I came off duty. But if Veldina didn't get the orders until I finished my shift, it meant the troops might get their requests a day late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I came up with a solution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plenty of Daevas come back to Pandaemonium with their pockets full of cash, go and spend it all on new gear, potions and skill manuals, and then find they've not saved enough for the teleporter ride back to wherever they need to be.</p>

          <p>Now you get it. If you're in that situation, [%username], I can help you out. If you take these supply requests over to Veldina for me, I'll give you 500 Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Why not drop the charge? Listen, I would if I could, but it's the law. Everyone pays, even the Governor. And every Kinah goes towards supporting the war effort. I don't pocket any of it.</p>
