          <p>[%username]! It just dawned on me...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you think it would be possible for something to come through the rift in the opposite direction? Monsters from Adma Stronghold could come to the Observatory Village!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's worse, during my last trip through the rift, I ran across a Lord Lannok. He was extremely powerful, and I was lucky to escape. If he comes here, it would be disasterous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing to enter the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_L_DF2a_entrance] and terminate him? I'm sure [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Atropos], will see that you're properly rewarded.</p>

          <p>Hello, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm starting to worry about that Giant Dimensional Rift. If any of the enemies beyond the rift were to come to the Observatory Village, it would be terrible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The worst would be if [%dic:STR_DIC_E_L_DF2a_Q3118] himself came through. He's one of the most powerful beings inside the Stronghold.</p>

          <p>You already killed him? Rovilance must be smarter than he looks to put you onto that.</p>

          <p>I guess I can relax a little then.</p>
