          <p>My superiors seem to think the duties here aren't enough to keep me busy. They ordered me to collect Titanium Ore between patrols and send it to them. They say it's needed for temple offerings in Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's the only time I get to rest. I'm not lazy, mind you, but everyone needs a break now and then!</p>

          <p>Of course someone has to do it--but they're out of touch with the reality of the situation here.</p>

          <p>We shouldn't be expected to go out and gather ore with all our other duties. I don't even know what good ore looks like. I'm no miner!</p>
