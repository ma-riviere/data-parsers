          <p>The Marchutan Priory and Empyrean Crucible are unique places. It only makes sense that they sell unique armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only are these pieces powerful as they are, they can also be Conditioned to enhance their abilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're looking for that extra edge on the battlefield, you've come to the right place.</p>
