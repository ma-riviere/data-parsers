          <p>Oh! Sorry, I thought you were looking for the Arena of Discipline, but I can tell you're a little too green for that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why not try the Discipline Training Grounds? The rules are the same, but the stakes are lower. I can even find you an opponent.</p>

          <p>No, no no. You're not nearly ready to enter the Training Grounds, let alone the Coliseum itself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if you're already level 46, you'll need to make sure you're not in a group, and maybe we can find you an opponent. Until then, I'm afraid you'll need to find another way to practice.</p>
