          <p>I don't think I've ever heard so much sharding whining in my life! "Oh, the Crucible is too hard!" "Oh, it hurts!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of these Daevas are hundreds of years old, but they haven't grown up! Look at me; I run the Crucible all the time, and I'm not complaining!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No wonder we're going to lose that battle in the future, if these are the kind of Daevas we have to work with.</p>
