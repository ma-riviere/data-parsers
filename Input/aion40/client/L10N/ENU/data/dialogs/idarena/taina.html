          <p>Ohh, I see, you've been sent to the Crucible Coliseum, but it's proving a little too much for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry! In the Discipline Training Grounds, you can practice against an opponent, but you won't have anything to lose. Shall I match you up with somebody?</p>

          <p>Ah. No. The reason you're having difficulty getting into the Arena of Discipline is because you don't meet the requirements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to be at least level 46, and--now this is the crucial part--not in a group, to compete in the Crucible Coliseum, or even to use the Training Grounds.</p>
