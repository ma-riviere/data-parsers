          <p>People said I was foolish for coming to a place like this to do research, but I'm not going to let the Balaur impede our search for knowledge. I came here to do research on Klaws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You think it's silly, I know. When Klaws were first discovered most ecologists thought they were merely Potcrabs transformed by the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we know better, because somebody bothered to do some research. Someone like me.</p>

          <p>Compared to Potcrabs, Klaws have remarkably high intelligence. They form well-organized and complex societies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's probably this difference in intelligence between Klaws and other organisms that's causing so many problems here in the Poya Jungle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Simply put, the survival of other animals is threatened by Klaws.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure yet. The Klaw problem has to be addressed though, or the ecology of the Poya Jungle could collapse completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've thought about just killing them, but that seems shortsighted. I need more data to find a better solution.</p>

          <p>Did you know that Klaws also live in the Eltnen desert? It's amazing that Klaws can adapt themselves perfectly to life in these two completely different environments.</p>

          <p>Oh my! These are completely different from the Klaw cells that I collected in Eltnen. They're practically a different species!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These Klaws are evolving at a very rapid pace!</p>

          <p>If we leave the situation as it is...well, I don't want to go into it, but it's not going to be good. In this case I think the simple and shortsighted solution is best.</p>

          <p>Even with your skills I don't think you could kill them all, [%username]. We have to kill the Klaw Queen. No more Queen means no more eggs, and eventually no more Klaws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Klawtan's Wallow and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Neutspawner_Q1053]. That should lure out [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2NamedQ_39_An]. As soon as she appears, kill her.</p>
