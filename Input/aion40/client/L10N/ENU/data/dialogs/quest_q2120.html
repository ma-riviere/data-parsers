          <p>So how are things back in Aldelle? Ulgorn and Tobu still ordering everyone around? I figured as much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was eager to get away--y'know, mix it up, get out of the rut. When Ulgorn wanted volunteers to come out here, I was halfway down the road before he was done with his speech.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No quotas, no bosses breathing down your neck, and plenty of opportunities to make money on the side. The only downside is the weather...</p>

          <p>Much too chilly--especially when we douse our campfire! And it's about time I did something about it. Think you can help me out?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2120a]s to properly insulate my tent. Brax have the thickest fur, so that should be the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll pay you well. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BraxD_5_n] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BraxBabyD_4_n] until you have three fur skins.</p>

          <p>Yes, these are excellent. Soft on one side and smooth on the other--these are genuine [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2120a]s, for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll start working on these straight away.</p>

          <p>Thanks for your help, [%userclass]. Here's your money, as promised. Oh, and if you're interested in any other 'business opportunities', you just speak to Derot, slide him a few Kinah, and he'll whisper in your ear. Just don't let Mijou hear you!</p>
