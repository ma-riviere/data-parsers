          <p>Those heathen Krall are plotting something, I know it. They inch closer to the Holy Ground every day since stealing the Icons, and their scouts spy on us constantly.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>The Krall are like a disease that afflicts the land itself.</p>

          <p>I wish I knew what they were up to. There are dark rumors from Sanctum about a Balaur uprising, and you can bet the Krall will have their foul paws in that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, I think it's time to take the fight to them--to the heart of the Krall stronghold!</p>

          <p>The moment is ripe, Daeva. To hesitate is to put all Atreia in danger. Let's hope focusing on reconnaissance has weakened their defenses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA23] and kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA66]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF1A_TKrallWarrior_19_An]s. Hit them so hard that any thoughts of trespassing on our Holy Ground will be banished forever!</p>

          <p>The vengeance of Seraphim Lord Kaisinel burns in your eyes, Daeva. You showed them what it means to defile his holy land with their presence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's impossible to be happy surrounded by death, even when it is the death of your enemies. The wheels of battle turn, yet I can't see in which direction they're taking us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I shouldn't speak of this after you have so bravely averted disaster. Morai and I managed to scrounge together these small tokens of our appreciation, please accept them, and our thanks.</p>
