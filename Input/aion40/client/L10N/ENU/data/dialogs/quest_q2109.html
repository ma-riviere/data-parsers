          <p>Did you know that every year here in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_3], the most precious and beautiful flower blooms? Gaze upon the lake and you'll see the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_3], one of Ishalgen's few things of beauty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not the only remarkable thing about this place, though. Look to the south, over there on the dock.</p>

          <p>There are other beauties here, too...</p>

          <p>Yes, more beautiful than any flower. Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Negi]. You know, I only joined Ulgorn's Raiders so that I might be closer to her. I'm not exactly fighting material.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's right there, and I'm a wreck! Every time I try and talk to Negi, I mumble some nonsense, I panic, or I freeze. Last time I got tangled up in my own fishing line and fell in the lake! She probably thinks I'm an idiot. But what can I do?</p>

          <p>The only fitting gift for someone as beautiful as [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Negi] would be a bouquet of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2109a]s. But I'm too scared to go into the lake. I got bit by a Slink last week, and those Airons always run toward me like they're going to peck my eyes out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I said, I'm not much of a raider. Shame on me, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're braver than I am, though. Have pity on a fool in love...gather some flowers for me?</p>

          <p>Three [%dic:STR_DIC_E_3]s should be enough to make a bouquet for Negi. I'll see if I can find a ribbon or something to bind them together.</p>
