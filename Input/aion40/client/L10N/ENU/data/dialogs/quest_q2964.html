          <p>He was a good man, strong and generous. To die like that, far from his home...it isn't right.</p>

          <p>No? You said yourself you saw his body. Our rules are few, but clear. Blood for blood. A life for a life.</p>

          <p>Jafnhar would do the same for me. He has fallen, and my duty is to give him justice.</p>

          <p>No, don't waste breath on their lives. Tradition and history demand a response. If it was the Shadow Elders, I'll uncover them.</p>
