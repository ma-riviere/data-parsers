          <p>Ah, my fellow Daeva, your footsteps resound in Aetheric cadence, your every movement propelled by a resplendence of spirit! With this newfound ascendancy, this rebirth, you are the very lifeblood of Aion, at one with the Aether that suffuses our world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We each have our purpose, our line to recite, yet are but feathers on the wings of a greater cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh dear! Just listen to me. I am a mere puppet of inspiration, as susceptible to its whim as a blade of grass to the wind.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I find myself at a disadvantage, in need of a favor. I must make a delivery to Verteron Citadel, but I'm unable to make the journey.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, if you were passing that way, you would be able to help me.</p>

          <p>I was commissioned, you see, and by no less a worthy than High Priest Selene of the Nobelium in the Verteron Citadel. She needed a Song of Praise to serve as an offering to Lady Yustiel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I slaved like a caged Kobold, squeezing every last drop of creative zeal from my being until, at last, I had it before me--a masterpiece befitting the generosity and benevolence of that great Seraphim Lady.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be able to deliver this most sacred of poems to High Priest Selene safely?</p>

          <p>Oh thank you, thank you for your help. I’m certain that your kindness is matched by your capability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My one caveat is that you must not read the poem yourself. My work is devoted entirely to Lady Yustiel and every unread word is an irreplaceable brick in its literary temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be prudent to seek teleportation for a task so delicate. You should ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Polyidus] for his guidance in this matter. Then take the poem to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Selene] right away.</p>

          <p>Tell me, do you not wonder at the miraculous nature of teleportation? It is a triumph of Aetheric manipulation. Of course I don't understand the intricacies, I merely operate the device.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Teleportation devices are connected to one another, and when the current of Aether is active between them, you can travel wherever you desire in an instant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Naturally, I receive a fee for enabling the process.</p>

          <p>Certainly. Teleportation is a popular means of transport to Verteron, such is the trouble with the Krall in that area these days.</p>

          <p>If you wish to leave for Verteron, I'll be glad to send you without delay.</p>

          <p>You are here at Valendir’s bidding? Thank the Five! I've waited anxiously for his poem of devotion to Lady Yustiel. It is to be a jewel amongst our offerings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's difficult for the common folk to understand such ceremony when they live under constant threat from the Krall. It may seem luxurious to extol the Seraphim Lords in such times, but this is precisely what is needed when hardship closes in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, without the Seraphim Lords, there would be no Verteron to fight for.</p>

          <p>I’m sure Valendir instructed you not to read the poem. I hope you heeded his words. If our offerings are to be unsullied we must resist the temptation to act irreverently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Temple offerings, no matter their material value, are solely intended for the Seraphim Lords. I’m sure you understand how important this is.</p>

          <p>Selene, High Priest of the Verteron Citadel, asked Valendir the bard to write a poem in devotion to Lady Yustiel as part of the temple's offerings. Although he composed the poem, Valendir could not deliver it personally and asked you to take it to Selene.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Polyidus teleported you to the Verteron Citadel, and you delivered the poem.</p>
