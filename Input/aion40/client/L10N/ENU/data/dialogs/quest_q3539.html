          <p>Those Krall sure look threatening, don't you think, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I'm getting used to them, but fighting them still makes me queasy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I'd never admit that to my cohorts! But you're so easy to talk with.</p>

          <p>Fairly well, but, well...there is something you could do for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See my sword? That big hole there? The Orichalcum coin that was inset there came out last week, somewhere in the swamp. No chance of finding it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been feeling rather skittish since then. That coin was my lucky charm. I was hoping I could convince you to bring me something to replace it.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I appreciate it. I know it's a silly request, but it would really help me feel more confident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3539A]s? They're a popular sword ornament, and rubbing them is said to soothe the spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get them by hunting [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BATRe2_34_An]s in the Decayed Grove.</p>

          <p>So these are the fabled claws.</p>
