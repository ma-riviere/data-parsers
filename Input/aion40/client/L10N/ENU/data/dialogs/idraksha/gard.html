          <p>Some are deceived by my appearance, thinking me a soft, pampered Daeva who's never done honest work in his life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you were to see my hands under my gloves, you'd see the calluses that can only come from hours of hard labor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Construction is a great art, and I'm proud to practice it. Perhaps you'd like to see what it's like for yourself?</p>

          <p>Construction has broad applications beyond the home. That's why we get so many Work Orders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's amazing how much we take for granted until we don't have it. Ever think of shelves? Tables? Chairs?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I appreciate your efforts. Elysea benefits from having diligent Construction crafters like you.</p>

          <p>Did you just say you'd take the Work Order without learning Construction? Are you confident or just plain ignorant?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such overconfidence can lead to recklessness, which leads to disaster, on the battlefield or in the workshop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you take the time to learn the basics of Construction first. Then come back to me.</p>
