          <p>Once I have it. The problem that I'm having is that the [%dic:STR_DIC_DG_noblemetal_n_c_20a] is proving very difficult to gather.</p>

          <p>The Skurvs are brilliant at finding the ore, you see, they just can't fight anything nearby it.</p>

          <p>You have helped me before, [%username], so maybe you'll help me again. Fetch the ore for me, and I'll pay you well. Do we have a deal?</p>
