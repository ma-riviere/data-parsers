          <p>Reporting for duty, [%username]? Good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two Archons--Olenja and I--can barely guard this place. There's a huge MuMu tribe just up the road, and we have to patrol Moslan Forest as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that the Fortress sent you to reinforce us...that changes things.</p>

          <p>When we first scouted the MuMu farm up the road, the Skurvs were just growing Ginseng so we left them alone. Like I said, we have a lot of territory to cover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then we got new orders from Commander [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sueron]...well, "orders" that started with, "Why haven't you two reported on how the Mumus have switched to growing [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA60], not Ginseng?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't disappoint the commander! You know how he is. And I suppose Suthran is right--we should have kept a closer eye on the MuMu tribe.</p>

          <p>First, we need to determine whether the commander is right about the MuMu tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_17] and find out whether those Skurvs are growing Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find their fields over the hill, along the road. Approach with strength and caution: not only are there Skurv sentries, but you may also see Mau from the Black Claw Tribe.</p>

          <p>I expected your report sooner, [%username]. I was beginning to think you had been caught by the Mau. And we don't have the manpower for a rescue mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you scouted the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_17]. Are they growing [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA60]?</p>

          <p>So Commander Suthran was right: the MuMu are growing Odella! The Mau must be behind that. They use Odella for some crude manipulations of Aether, I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't want to just report what the commander already knows. I want to show Suthran some progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sending you back to the MuMu's farming field, but not to scout. Now you're going back as a proper Asmodian would. You're going to burn.</p>
