          <p>I can see that you don't share my concern. How could you, really? You're still alive. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you ever wonder why I'm here? Why some cannot pass into the flow of Aether? There are reasons, you see. When we hold on too tightly to something in life, it becomes our shackle after death. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_AkanNamed_50_Al] cannot be persuaded to give up this hopeless task, then he will be chained here after death as surely as I am. He deserves so much more than this...everyone does.</p>
