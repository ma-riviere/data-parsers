          <p>One of humankind's first achievements, fire. It's not even that complicated, but there's something about it that I just can't get right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't steam my Xilix leaves without fire. Can't sell my steamed Xilix leaves if they aren't steamed. Can't feed myself without money.</p>

          <p>Tecoma. I know it's the cheapest, but with my profit margins are tight as they are, I can't afford Salix or Asvata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen, I know this is a big request, but I could really use your help right now. I've heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4333A]s stay burning hot for hours, even without fuel or accelerants. If I could get my hands on a few, I'd have no problems getting back to my winning ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help? I just need a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireFungyRe2D_34_An]s killed....</p>
