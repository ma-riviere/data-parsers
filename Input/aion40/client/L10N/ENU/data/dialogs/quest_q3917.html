          <p>I really appreciate the samples of Drana and Dragel, [%username]. I know they weren't easy to get.</p>

          <p>I'm not ready to publish anything yet, of course, but real progress is being made--mysteries are being unraveled.</p>

          <p>Do you happen to know [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LC1_28] of the Tigraki Workshop? She's a Shugo in the Artisans Hall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She expressed great interest when I mentioned Drana. I suspect because so much of her work revolves around utilizing Balaur...parts....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's interested in working a trade with you.</p>

          <p>Of course she'll have some hoops for you to jump through.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will probably involve a fair amount of patience and discomfort in sadly unequal portions, but it should pay off handsomely.</p>
