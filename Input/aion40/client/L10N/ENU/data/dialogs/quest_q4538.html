          <p>Too many problems, too few hands. Always.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can't ask for reinforcements from Pandaemonium--they're firing off every free squadron to the Abyss or Balaurea--so we just have to make do with what we have.</p>

          <p>At least the Elyos seem to be in the same boat, I suppose....</p>

          <p>Hmm. Maybe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know of the refugee village to the east of Beluslan? We've heard reports that it's under siege from an undead attack, and while Nerita wants to dispatch troops there now, things aren't quite so simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nerita's written up a letter that needs to get to the village. Contents are top secret, and they need to be sent over as soon as possible. Do you still want in?</p>

          <p>Good. Here's the letter.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_E1] is located to the east of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_A]. Should be easy enough to find; just make sure you watch yourself out there.</p>
