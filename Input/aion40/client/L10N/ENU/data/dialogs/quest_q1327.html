          <p>This is a solitary place, [%username]. A man ends up talking to himself if he isn't careful. Ends up seeing things you wouldn't think possible.</p>

          <p>Then, when you DO see things that aren't possible and realize they're actually happening, you sit there and you wonder--what if I was wrong this whole time? What if left is right, and up is down?</p>

          <p>I'm talking about the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Maidengolem_27_An]s! Statues, [%username], statues that move, and fight, and feel!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought I was going mad at first. Really. Came back here and had a good sleep, but they were still out there the next day, still walking around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked around about them. Seems they used to guard the Artifact, and they'd come to life if it was threatened, but now, with no Artifact....</p>

          <p>Yes. Now they just lash out at anything that gets close enough. We need to destroy them, before they do some real harm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help? Like I said, this is a solitary place--we need all the help we can get.</p>

          <p>Good. I had a feeling you'd say yes.</p>

          <p>When you can, head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G1] and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Maidengolem_27_An]s there. Beautiful as they are, they're supposed to be inanimate objects, and I'd prefer them that way.</p>

          <p>They were becoming increasingly aggressive, so you agreed to go to the Outpost Ruins and destroy the Caryatids.</p>
