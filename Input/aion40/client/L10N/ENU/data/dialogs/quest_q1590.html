          <p>[%username], you've returned innumerable spirits to the flow of Aether. Surely you are blessed by Lady Yustiel herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum was pleased with the report that we put to rest the undead who hurt Humans and Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But our work is never complete, and I mourn for those who wander the world still, without solace or respite.</p>

          <p>That may be so, and yet the tortured undead still walk among us. It's heartbreaking to see the many we failed to protect rise again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at Medeus Manor--Anubite Warriors still patrol its ruined hills and farmland.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must help them. May I rely on you to return them to the flow of Aether?</p>
