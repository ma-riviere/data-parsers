          <p>Your exploits have birthed dozens of rumors, [%username]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be frank, it's good to see a Daeva of some renown here in Silentera Canyon. This is one of the most dangerous, if not the most dangerous, place in all of Balaurea. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Marauding Jotuns, hordes of Balaur, and then of course the Elyos are slipping through the cracks--it's a nightmare keeping this place under our control.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You won't see a lot of Elyos out here, but head deeper in and...well...just be careful.... You're taller in the stories I've heard...but I suppose size wouldn't matter for one with serious skills. </p>
