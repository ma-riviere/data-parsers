          <p>I've been in constant contact with General Valetta, coordinating our assaults on the Chantra Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you well know by now, the Balaur--or at least, many of them--are not mindless brutes. They're as smart as us...some even smarter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're going to have to step up our strategy if we want to be beat them...or else counter with something that even intelligence has a hard time with.</p>

          <p>Right! If you dominate your opponent in strength sufficiently, the value of strategy begins to break down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to keep the pressure on--keep them from regrouping and shifting tactics, sap their resources so they can't implement their plans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That applies to the Balaur in general, and the Chantra Dredgion in particular. But we'll need your help to do it.</p>

          <p>There are two things you can do for us: the first is to press into the Chantra Dredgion as much as possible. Don't let up, don't let them recover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The second is to kill as many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanFiHigh_55_Ae]es as you can. They're the main combat forces aboard, and fewer of them means more damage done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All of this is intended to wear the Chantra Dredgion down--as much as possible, and as quickly as possible. You need to be relentless.</p>

          <p>Well, that was unexpected. Compared to some of your other missions, this one is relatively simple...at least in concept.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that needs to be done is to infiltrate the Chantra Dredgion. No killing of specific crew members or anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to drag you along kicking and screaming. I hope you have something better to do.</p>

          <p>I've been talking to some other Daevas who've been fighting aboard the Chantra Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some say that it's getting just a little easier every time. A little less resistance, a little more damage done....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think Yorgen's strategem is working. But that's only because we have Daevas like you putting pressure on them.</p>

          <p>Yes, taking down Balaur is always satisfying, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also understand that they've been scrambling to replace the soldiers you've been killing. That alone is significant progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we keep this up, we could destroy the Balaur's supply lines here entirely. That would be a great victory, and you'd be a major part of it!</p>
