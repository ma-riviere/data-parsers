          <p>I told her, "Teleportation is tricky, not something to mess with." Of course, she didn't listen, did she?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has to try her little experiments. "I can do it without the machine," she says. "Just watch," she says.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sonirim], of course. She has guts, I'll give her that, but she's crazy thinking that she can teleport anyone by manipulation of Aether alone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She won't listen to me, of course. Just asks me to send her people she can practice on.</p>
