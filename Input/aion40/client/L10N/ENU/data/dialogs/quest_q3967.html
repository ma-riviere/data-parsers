          <p>Well, hello, [%username]. How kind of you to drop by. It's almost as though you knew that arriving at this particular moment would cause the maximum frustration!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why, yes, I have managed to finish the design for the Daevas of Life uniform while you were gone, and I need only need to finish off the sample.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, how overworked I used to be. However did I manage without an assistant?</p>

          <p>No, I don't want to fire you or yell at you.</p>

          <p>I WANT to tie you up and dump you in Pandaemonium, wearing a handmade dress and a sign that says, "Free Elyos to a bad home. We eat your children. Please sacrifice one to me now because I'm so hungry."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alas, I cannot do this, so I shall settle for sending you to Arenzes in the Hall of Prosperity. You will go to him and politely ask for my dye box. I need to dye the sample fabric to match my immaculate vision.</p>
