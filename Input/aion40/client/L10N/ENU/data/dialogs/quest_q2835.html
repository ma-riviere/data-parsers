	<p>Modern craftsmanship pales in comparison with these Ancient Seals. Thanks to you, this'll become a treasure of Pandaemonium instead of becoming just another piece of loot in the Balaur collection.</p>

	<p>Sure, I COULD exchange that for you... if you wanted to throw points away. I suppose you weren't to know, but there's a limit to how many points you can have right now, so just get a bit stronger, and we'll have a chat then.</p>
