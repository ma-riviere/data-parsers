          <p>Gerania! She restores antique documents filled with lost languages and secret messages. She's become an expert cryptographer with a command of ancient Atreian and even Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If anyone can puzzle out this diary, Gerania can. Hmmm... Even with her help, we may need to call on Hygea's skills as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing to get this diary deciphered for me?</p>

        <p>First, meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gerania] in the Hidden Library. Even if she can decipher the diary, though, it may be full of Lepharist jargon.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If that's the case, ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hygea] to interpret it for you. Find her in the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA24] of Sanctum.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>One more thing: This mission is of great importance. It must be kept secret...at least until we figure everything out.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I was wondering about the Lepharist situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been a while since you brought me that tissue sample from RM-78c. I've asked Xenophon many times about it, but he insisted it was too early to tell me much.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Do you mean that this RM-78c project involves Lepharists in Asmodae as well? We've no time to waste. Give me Gerania's decryption.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion's light! The Lepharists used a compound to make RM-78c, but a specific component of the compound caused severe side effects. They succeeded in removing the problematic component, so now there's no adverse effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The diary says that when they administered the new compound, the Lepharists got a more stable subject than RM-78c was. [%username], this is disastrous news. Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Xenophon] as fast as you can and tell him.</p>

          <p>We have to find out where that new test subject is. I'll send scouts all over Atreia and collect as much information as possible.</p>

          <p>I searched all through the Lepharist Research Center, and what did I find? In the corner of the Research Center, there's an Abyss Gate connecting to Azoturan Landing. I'd put my last Kinah on it--the modified Human test subject is being held there.</p>
