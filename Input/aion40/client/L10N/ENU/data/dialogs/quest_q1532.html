          <p>I used to have keepsakes--a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1532a] and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1532b] with a portrait inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were precious to me, but I can't remember when I saw them last. I may have lost them while fighting with Trolls. Or maybe I lost them while wandering, and a Keraton picked them up.</p>
          <p> </p>
