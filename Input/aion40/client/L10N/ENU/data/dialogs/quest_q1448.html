          <p>Yes. Kyola Temple. I've been here for ages it seems. But I'm no closer to being able to spend nearly enough time inside the Temple. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kyola Temple was an Atreian holy site before the Cataclysm. It saddens me to see it in such a state...</p>

          <p>Well for one, just clearing out some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BAT_33_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Succubus_33_An]es defiling the place would help me get inside to see if anything magical is happening inside. </p>

          <p>Wonderful. I've been able to pick off a couple Bloodwings and a Temptress, and they revealed a small clue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temptress carried a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1448a] and one of the Bloodwings contained a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1448b]. I've never heard of any other creatures with such unusual things so I expect they're highly significant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to send several off to Sanctum for further study.</p>

          <p>Wow. That's a lot of them. I wonder if so many might be dangerous. I think I'll find something to contain them. </p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. I'll be able to send these off to Sanctum and maybe learn more about the contamination.</p>
