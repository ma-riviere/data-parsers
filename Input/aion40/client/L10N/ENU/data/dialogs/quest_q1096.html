          <p>[%username], I'm surprised to see you! It's been so long!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear you've been working hard though, and your equipment seems to indicate you've reaped the rewards of your endeavors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad you're here actually. I've learned something about your past...something you should know.</p>

          <p>I remember you said that you were the Brigade General of the secret Mirage Legion. You said you lost your memory while fighting Orissan at Karamatis...something about a trap set by Icaronix--one of your own men?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The tale seemed strange, yet familiar, so I did some digging. I found out what the Mirage Legion...what you...were doing there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wasn't easy though. Some of your men went into hiding and were nigh on impossible to track down.</p>

          <p>Your mission in Karamatis was to find the Artifact of Memory to uncover details about an ancient event.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your Legionaries went first but they ran into trouble. As you know, the mission failed and you ended up...well, I don't need to tell you.</p>

          <p>Listen, this is important. If you can find the Artifact of Memory, you'll have a chance to restore your memories. You may also learn the secrets you originally sought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have no clue where Karamatis is or how to get there. Try speaking to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ludina], the owner of the Dionysia Tavern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should get you the route to Karamatis. If she's reluctant to help, mention Pernos. Those two have history.</p>

          <p>Do you know the Divine Fortress in Reshanta? I was told that the rift underneath it opens at a specific time. You could probably get to Karamatis through there.</p>

          <p>Haha...and so the circle is finally complete. I assume you come seeking the Artifact of Memory...and the route to Karamatis.</p>

          <p>I should warn you, recovering your memories will not make everything right in the world. It may even make things more difficult.</p>

          <p>So be it. Karamatis has a portal that opens very irregularly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rift, the gateway to Karamatis, will be open soon. This is your path to your future...and your past.</p>
