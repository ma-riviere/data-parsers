          <p>Yes, Tutty. He's...my pet Porgus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I lavish the little fellow with as much care as I would my own child. He bolted yesterday when I turned my back. He hasn't answered me when I've called for him, nor did he return for his dinner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell me, [%userclass], would you find him for me? Age has gnarled my knees, my sight is failing...I'd have little chance on my own.</p>

          <p>He loves to run, so he may be quite a distance away. However, he should be easy to recognize among other Porgus. He's tame, and he knows that people and campfires mean food!</p>
