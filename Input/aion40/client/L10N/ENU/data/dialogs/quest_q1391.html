          <p>Yes, what is it? This text will not decipher itself.</p>

          <p>RM-12b? You thought this was encrypted? It's no code, it's a name tag. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We see these sometimes attached to Lepharist test subjects. RM, RM...that's the base in Poya Jungle! And "12" must mean that it was subject number 12...but "b?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Congratulations. You've managed to bring me something more interesting than these codes. Leave this with me--I want to have a closer look. And take this for your troubles.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Perento said that it's not an encrypted text but the label of a test subject created by Lepharist Revolutionaries, and asked you to give it to him for further study.</p>
