          <p>I'm supposed to be watching Motgar, but he doesn't do much, so I have plenty of time to think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never thought I'd end up like this. I always thought I'd be a farmer like my father.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then there was my sweetheart... Ademia and I grew up together, and as soon as the harvest was in, we'd marry and start our own family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wasn't meant to be.</p>

          <p>Ademia ascended... I know I should be happy for her but I was devastated. She told me she had to go to Pandaemonium for her ceremony... only temporary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She left me her mother's ring... and nothing else. She never returned, so I left... left to walk Asmodae, and ached. Nothing else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I woke up one morning after a rough night, and saw Tobu and a couple of raiders standing over me. They got me back on my feet and sorted me out.</p>

          <p>What was the point? Ademia was immortal, charged with great deeds. I... was just a farmer. I'd grow old, die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I got furious with this whole damned situation about a week ago. I took her ring out of my pocket and hurled it into some bushes. If we're doomed, why carry a reminder?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so ashamed. I fear the day Ademia returns and asks me to marry her, and I'll have lost... thrown away the ring. I retraced my steps and found some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_merdionD_4_n]s near the bush where I'd thrown the ring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't leave my post, [%username] but I can't lose that ring. Will you help?</p>

          <p>Please find it. I feel awful for throwing it away.</p>

          <p>Well... I suppose that's fair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's strangely liberating, knowing I have nothing tangible to remind me of Ademia. Maybe now I'll finally be able to move on with my life. Perhaps that... helps Ademia let go of her Human ties... ties like me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for listening, [%username]. I'd never spoken to anyone about Ademia before. Perhaps life goes on.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]! I'd almost given up hope of ever seeing this again. And despite... where you found it... it looks just fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I doubt I'll ever see Ademia again, but if I do, I'll make sure she takes this ring back. She'll either take it as her own wedding ring, or she'll take it as her family heirloom--a reminder of the Humans who raised her and loved her.</p>
