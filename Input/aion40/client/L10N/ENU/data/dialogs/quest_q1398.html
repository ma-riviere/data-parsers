		<p>Before I became an Administration Officer, I used to roam all over Atreia, collecting Silver Coins.</p>

		<p>Now I am in charge of distributing rewards to Gladiators, Templars, Rangers, and Assassins who collect them. As for the future...who knows?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Anyway, how many Silver Coins have you collected? I'm sure you know the more Coins you have, the better the items you get, right?</p>
