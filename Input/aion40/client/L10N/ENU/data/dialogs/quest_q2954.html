          <p>Thank you! Some days I can barely make it through my shift, but I heard about this Odella Juice, so I tried it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's good stuff! Makes your hands and feet tingle. Kind of hard to stop drinking it, though, once you've taken up the habit. It's good for you, though! Keeps you healthy! Improves your reaction speed! I can feel it doing me good right now!</p>

          <p>It turned out that Haven had forgotten Doman's Odella Juice again, so she gave it to you.</p>

          <p>When you brought the Odella Juice to Doman, he explained that he needed it to help keep up his energy, because working the teleporter all day was so exhausting.</p>
