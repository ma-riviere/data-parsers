          <p>The biggest problem for the people of Eltnen is the desertification of the whole region, but it's not just people who suffer from thirst in this parched climate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The animals, emboldened by empty homes and villages and driven by hunger, have grown more vicious. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guardians are assigned the duty of eliminating those violent animals, but it's an enormous undertaking.</p>
