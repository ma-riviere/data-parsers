          <p>Ah, [%username], it's been some time. You're really making waves here in Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd have come to my attention, even if Munin hadn't sent word to keep an eye on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many aspiring Daevas here, but you stand out from the crowd. Perhaps it's the bandit blood. </p>

          <p>No. But you've impressed the right people with your abilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Information officer Njord is one of them. He asked me to send you to him the next time I saw you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you say? He's an influential Daeva.</p>

          <p>A wise choice. You need as many friends as you can get. Most people don't trust former bandits, and your association with Munin doesn't sit well, either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My advice is to carry on exactly as you have been. It's surprising how quickly people can change their minds.</p>

          <p>That's right! You're needed in the Abyss. Our soldiers there spend as much time retreating as they do attacking, what with Elyos and Balaur coming at them from all angles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need something to swing the fight in our favor, and I don't think one of Agamo's ballads is going to cut it. Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garvages] in Reshanta says they might have stumbled across some sort of weapon out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's probably nothing, but go and speak with him. Ask if there's anything you can do to help.</p>
