          <p>Hmm...actually, I don't think this was written by the Balaur at all--all these grammar errors. And it's written on Shugo paper.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I don't know why they're writing in Balic. Maybe they don't want other people to decode it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suspect the Black Cloud Traders are involved somehow. Go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_1]--he'll probably know something.</p>

          <p>Midori said this document was written by Shugos, and sent you to the Black Cloud Traders. They told you it contained the items of a shipment they'd lost months ago, thanked you for bringing it to their attention, and said you don't need to concern yourself any further. What's a Shulack, anyway?</p>
