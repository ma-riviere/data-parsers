          <p>Confidentially, being a captain is remarkably simple. All I need is a tall ship and a compass to steer her by.</p>

          <p>Ship, Daevie. Ship! I know precisely where me ship is. She's anchored right over thar.</p>

          <p>Knowin' where me ship be is one thing, but knowin' where she's goin'...that be the key. No point in cap'nin' a ship with nowhere to go.</p>

          <p>What? Just buy a new compass? That be a fine answer for an ordinary captain. But Cap'n Jackdaw be no ordinary captain. And rightly so, me compass is no ordinary compass.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a special magic compass. It points me to me treasures.</p>

          <p>I've searched all o'er this sandy beach for me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4057a] and it's not turned up yet. Pity I've lost it. Such a treasure it is.</p>
