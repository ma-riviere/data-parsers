          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. Do you have any Honorable Mithril Medals you're looking to trade?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can't get those refunded once they're spent, so don't come crying to me if you make a mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the other claw, if you're sure of what you want, then you should go find one of the Daevas in charge of distributing Honorable items.</p>

          <p>Did you know, I used to be a recordkeeper for the Abyss Contributions Distribution Center?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I decided to come do some fieldwork and see how our distributors operate. I miss my quiet office.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really don't think I'm cut out for sales work.</p>
