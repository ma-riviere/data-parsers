          <p>Oh, hello Daeva. I suppose you'd like me to read your [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_CCU_CHINA_01]? Luos here has finally convinced me to do this for the public; he told me it was my duty to share my gift with the world. Bring me more fortunes, and you can claim more lucky rewards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can make the fortunes yourself, but only I can read them. Make an envelope of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_CHINA_02A], and fold some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_CHINA_01A] into it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Open the resulting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_HCOIN201A_BOX_04], and bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_CCU_CHINA_01] inside.</p>

          <p>I'm a little nervous. I've been reading fortunes all my life, but just for my friends and family. This is the first time I've ever done it for the public.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, just bring me your [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_CCU_CHINA_01]s, and since I'm so new at this, I'll make sure you get well rewarded.</p>
