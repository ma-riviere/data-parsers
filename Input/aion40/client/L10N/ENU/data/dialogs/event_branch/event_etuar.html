          <p>Yes, I'm the one collecting insect fossil fragments, but I don't remember asking for the help of some shambling oaf. This is a delicate procedure, you know. If you've damaged any of those fossils, I'll report you to... to... oh, I'm sure I'll find someone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need insect fossils for our new Natural History Museum--but we're only paying for the ones that survived excavation, mind. If you haven't found any, you can probably retrieve them from monsters just about everywhere... well, maybe not Poeta and Verteron... but I can't imagine that after that they'll be in any state we can use.</p>

          <p>The fossils we collect are vital, important--and delicate! Did you know we can predict shifts in Atreia's crust from them? But only if we have enough to analyze. I had some lout the other day who crumbled a whole box of them into dust in a moment of carelessness. Now you tell me what I'm supposed to do with that!</p>
