          <p>Hello, Daeva! [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Octorung] requested us brewers to come, nyerk. Brewer of best beer will be given excellent prize, but I just want to prove mine is best!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would Daeva like to help? Need plenty of Octobrunerk's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_INGREDIENT] to win. Put trust in me, not in other brewers, and in return, will give tickets to exchange for beer when ready. Chance to try prize-winning beer, nyerk?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, if not want beer, can exchange for Platinum Medals. Even if beer doesn't win first place, Daeva won't regret helping.</p>
