          <p>There is something I need to ask of you, [%username]. There are others I could turn to, but you have demonstrated a degree of skill at Handicrafting that belies your status as a [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's uncanny how easily it comes to you. Perhaps that's why it's easy for me to come to you when greater issues come to me from the Abyss.</p>

          <p>It's Lucius. He's pouring all his energy into keeping our Daeva well stocked, but as the battle reaches new heights so does the need for supplies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently, he received a custom order from a high-placed officer in the Nezekan Shield Legion. He doesn't have a workshop there capable of making this custom grip, and this client is quite eager. I can't imagine how the officer will react if Lucius can't fulfill the order soon. War can do strange things to a person, you know.... It can change them beyond recognition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you to deliver the staff grip for me? You have proven that you can handle yourself, and the trip may prove useful if you wish to familiarize yourself with the field of battle.</p>
