          <p>He stole a goblet from some temple offerings, threw Sanctum into utter confusion.</p>

          <p>These two descriptions, plus the timing! Phelos was in Sanctum right when Kelaino stole the goblet. Yeah, this is one guy!</p>

          <p>This job, you meet all kinds, but this guy Kelaino is slick!</p>
