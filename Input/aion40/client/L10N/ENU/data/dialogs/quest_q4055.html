          <p>Aye, that's a problem, ain't it? Me crew is ta blame fer me sad, sad predicament. Me straight, steady hand and vast knowledge guided the Black Opal to the shore of the greatest booty Atreia had e'er seen. Then those greasy, greedy bilge rats conspired a mutiny. They abandoned me on a dusty, deserted island and took away me ship and all the treasure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ol' Jackdaw ain't without his tricks, though! I followed 'em all the way here, but then...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Somethin' went wrong fer 'em, Daevie. Me crew was once the finest bunch o' sailors you'd e'er lay eyes on. But look at those miserable curs now! Marchutan's cursed 'em into monsters. Little good me ship or me treasure does 'em now.</p>

          <p>Blast! Yer a talky one, Daevie! You be thinkin' old Jackdaw wants vengeance, don't you? Well, that ain't it at all.
