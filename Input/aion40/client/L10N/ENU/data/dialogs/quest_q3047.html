          <p>I'm sure you'll have to move on to some important Daeva business soon, but I'd really like to keep you around. We need the likes of you around here.</p>

          <p>Well, since you asked.... I know of a particular rotten Calydon we call [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAsNamedQ_47_An]. I made a bet with the rest of the camp that nobody could catch him. As you might guess, he has one tooth made entirely of gold.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>If you can kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAsNamedQ_47_An] and bring me his [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3047a], I'll collect on that bet. Of course there'll be something in it for you....</p>

          <p>Killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAsNamedQ_47_An] should be fun. Really I should just go kill him myself and save my money, but...I love watching you work, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm betting you'll be back in a flash with that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3047a].</p>

          <p>It's much bigger than I thought!</p>
