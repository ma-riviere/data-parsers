          <p>It's the Frillnecks, you see. You must have noticed them. They never used to be so abundant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is an upside to the sudden spike in their numbers, though. It's now much easier to get Frillneck eggs. </p>

          <p>Well, you know Eradis in Tolbas Village? The food merchant? He's after them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd found a few on my way back to the village, so I brought them with me. I bumped into Eradis on the path and found out those eggs were just what he'd been looking for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next thing I know, there's a new item on the menu: Eradis' Special Omelette. It was a roaring success. Nemia couldn't resist buying it, so I tried some. It was pretty good--would have been better if I hadn't known what was in it, but still....</p>

          <p>Eradis caught word that I was planning to return to the forest and asked me to get him a few more eggs.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wasn't a big request, but I've gotten so far behind in my work that I haven't been able to find any yet. Eradis must be getting anxious by now. Probably trying to coax an egg out of a Porgus.</p>

          <p>I can't say I'm not relieved. Thank you, Daeva.</p>

          <p>You'll find Frillneck eggs in the shade of the trees, or secreted somewhere out of sight. The Frillnecks do their best to protect them.</p>         
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eradis should be happy with, oh, six eggs. Once you've found them, bring them to him in [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA10]. That'll keep him going for a month, at least. As long as he doesn't start eating his own stock.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Eradis' Special Omelette! It special, it's an omelette, and it's made by me, Eradis. It's the most popular dish in the region, and not without good reason.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Healthy and delicious, it's the secret ingredient that makes all the difference. </p>
