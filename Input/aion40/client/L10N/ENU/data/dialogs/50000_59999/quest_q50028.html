          <p>This formula has to be successful! It's the only way to return my brother from the Talon armor he's bound to. I've done a few successful tests since coming to Elysea, but I've been very cautious. I don't want to repeat my mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I need some Life Essences to perform more precise tests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring me five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2]s, I will share my alchemy design with you.</p>

          <p>I need Ancient Energy and Life Essence for my experiment.</p>

          <p>The other ingredients... are a secret. Let's just say that I can find them myself.</p>

          <p>I still need five more [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2]s though. Did you bring them?</p>

          <p>Thank you. This is an excellent Life Essence sample.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this, I can run another experiment on my transformation formula.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I succeed, then you'll be able to meet Albert in his own body, not the Talon armor he is in now.</p>
