          <p>Oh, I think you would have loved it in the days of the first Daevas. I mean, constant party, right? Every time someone ascended! 'Course, it got to be waaaay too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These days, everyone's too busy. There's a war on, as they'll never let you forget. At least we have this big Ascension Festival for all the Daevas who have ascended in the past year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, yeah, and one big festival means...one HUGE cake! It's the talk of Pandaemonium! Don't you just love it?</p>

          <p>This year's festival is notable for more than just cake, though. There are so many new Daevas this time around that their Ascension Energy has started crystallizing into tangible items. You've probably got some in your cube without even knowing it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry, it's not creepy--it's TOTALLY super-exciting. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DC1_Emma], the Gift Trader over there, is trading them for some really special stuff.</p>

          <p>Hi! I'm sorry if I repeat myself, but I've been really busy during this festival. Anyway, you probably met my sister Elma, back in the summer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was collecting the scorching heat and giving out fun stuff in return. And now I'm doing the same for the Ascension Festival! Do you have any Ascension Energy for me?</p>
