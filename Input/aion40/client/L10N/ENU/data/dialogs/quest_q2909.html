          <p>The basic principle of alchemy is "You can't make a sobi purse out of a sow's ear." Or, "Garbage in, garbage out."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every so often, some witless Daeva decides it's possible to make gold with alchemy. Suddenly everyone wants to study it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking as a qualified alchemist who's made a study of herbs, their properties, and how they interrelate, I haven't time for such nonsense.</p>

          <p>Thank you. You don't have the wide-eyed slack-jawed look of a gold-seeker, so perhaps you are a serious student. If so, I welcome you with open arms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Beginners need one thing more than anything else--practice! Grind away like a pestle and mortar, and you'll find alchemy reveals her secrets to you a little at a time.</p>

          <p>Start with basic elements and work on transforming them. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2909a] is one of the most basic alchemical ingredients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So gather a good quantity and use the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_Alchemy_production] next to me to make [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2909b]. That'll give you a good basic grounding in alchemy.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2909a]'s not hard to find. Just hunt Lobnites, Crasaur, and Sparkies in the Altgard Ice Lake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've got the bits, the equipment's all right here to brew up some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2909b]. Say--what's a nice round number--fifteen units.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're just starting out, it's a good idea to bring more ingredients than you expect to use. Novices make mistakes, and mistakes use up resources.</p>

          <p>Yes...the clarity is excellent, the purity flawless. I think that is enough practice for now.</p>

          <p>Do you know, when I first started, it took me weeks to perform that transformation? All I could produce was a sort of orange phlegm. But now I'm a master. If I can succeed, then you certainly can,[%username].</p>
