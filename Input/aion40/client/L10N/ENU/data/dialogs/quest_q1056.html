          <p>Welcome to Heiron, [%username]. I am Sofne and I would speak with you a moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It has come to my attention that the Lepharists are plotting in the Poya Jungle. This is of some concern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As my centurions are engaged with the Balaur and undead, I could use the aid of one such as yourself.</p>

          <p>The Lepharists have a research base in the Jungle, though they think they've hidden it from me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have an agent in place, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kalendros], who watches over them. I suggest speaking with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has the clearest picture of the plot, he'll know best how to stop it. Please do as he asks.</p>

          <p>I alerted Graa, my superior, about the Lepharists a long time ago. I don't, um, know that she believed me.</p>
