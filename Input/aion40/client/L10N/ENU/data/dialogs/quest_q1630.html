          <p>Heiron is a fantastic opportunity for an archaeologist--ruins everywhere, and relics just inches beneath the surface.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Nolantis Ruins are amazing. I've read about them my whole life--the legendary marine city--and here I am at last!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm dying to start my work.</p>

          <p>The Puitonen Bogs--they're full of artifacts. By looking at a pot, I can learn about the people who lived around there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the whole area is patrolled by the undead, not to mention Basilisks and Crynacs and all sorts of horrible creatures. It's far more dangerous than I ever imagined. That's why I haven't started yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I...I hesitate to ask this. It seems unethical...and yet...well...could you help me, Daeva? Will you search Puitonen Bogs and find Ancient Pots for me? You can usually find them inside Ancient Plate Boxes.</p>

          <p>That's wonderful--thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the Puitonen BogsÂ you can often find [%dic:STR_DIC_E_OBJ_LF3_Relic_Q1630]es between fragments of broken buildings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Five pots would be perfect. They're quite heavy and very old, so be careful not to break them.</p>

          <p>It's like torture, you know--there are the artifacts, RIGHT THERE, and I can't get to them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without our historical relics, we'd have little of the lore that helps us understand ascendance and the Empyrean Lords, right?</p>

          <p>I guess...I guess I'll ask some other Daeva for help, though your kind doesn't come through here very often. But...if you change your mind, I'll be right here.</p>
