          <p>[%username], you've done well to make it this far. Are you prepared for the third stage of the Abyss entry test?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before you answer, know that the battlefield of the Abyss is in constant motion, and your strategies must adapt accordingly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To this end, I have readied three missions to prepare and test you, if you are ready to proceed.</p>
