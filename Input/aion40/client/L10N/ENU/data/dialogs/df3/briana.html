          <p>How could a few Daevas of Flame melt a whole frozen city like this? It was nonsense from the beginning.</p>

          <p>I think Kistenian is a bigger problem. He wants to restore the "good old days."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better to build a new city rather than invest this much effort in melting the old one.</p>
