          <p>I came here because Thor had asked me officially to help the Drakan Punisher Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, what I do is to investigate several things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People may not know what Archons of Dusk do specifically. But, honestly, they all know that we go around to investigate something, don't they?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And what I'm investigating is related to Balaur. I don't think there is anything other than Balaur in this place that we can investigate. Hiding what we are doing here would be rather ridiculous--everyone knows what we're doing. </p>
