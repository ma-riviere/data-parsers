          <p>It's natural to fear the alien, [%username]. New sights, new people, new species--they all produce an element of fear on some level.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the undead. They're visually terrifying creatures, with rotting skin, protruding bones, and a stench unlike any other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For some, though, the undead are even more terrifying. Do you know why?</p>

          <p>Yes, exactly! An unrecognizable undead face is bad enough, but imagine recognizing those lurching, shambling creatures as former friends, neighbors, partners...children!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The horror of having to destroy what remains of a loved one to protect yourself never leaves a person. The scars stay with them for life. Trust me....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I left. That's why I'm here.</p>
