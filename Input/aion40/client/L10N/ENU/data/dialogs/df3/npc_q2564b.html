          <p>I can't believe Kistenian is trying to warm the city all on his own. He shouldn't be wasting his power like that.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>He always wanted to be here. He used to sing Kurngalfberg's praises all the time. When he came here, he vowed to revive the city with his own hands--and this is the result.</p>

          <p>There's no sign the ice is thawing, is there? His colleagues say it isn't possible, but nothing stops him. I don't want to die in a frozen wasteland. </p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I believe in him, but if people lose faith we'll surely fail. Kistenian seems like a man possessed. I don't know what will happen to him if we fail. I will do everything I can to achieve our goals. I can't help but worry, though. It's just so hard. </P>
