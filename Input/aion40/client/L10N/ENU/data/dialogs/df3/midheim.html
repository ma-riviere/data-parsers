          <p>Though we were not well-to-do, we always thanked the Five Shedim Lords for what we had. But our meager happiness was destroyed when my husband became one of the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He even attacked our son, Rotenan. I can barely stand to think of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I can't let that horror keep me from protecting my son. I'll do anything to make sure Rotenan stays safe.</p>
