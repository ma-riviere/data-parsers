          <p>Are you one of those sad cases who believe in the calling of Daevas or whatever? I understand, of course--newly ascended Daevas retain their enthusiasm for the calling and volunteer their services as Archons. They anxiously look for a chance to follow the will of Empyrean Lords. They're still ignorant of the real world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's pitiful that long-lived Daevas still sing the praises of the calling. After such a long life, they still don't realize that it's a transparent trick of the Empyrean Lords to brainwash Daevas and sweat them for free.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've never thought about it that way, think it over. It's not too late to change your mind.</p>
