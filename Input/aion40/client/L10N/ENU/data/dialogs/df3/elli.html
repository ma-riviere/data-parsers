          <p>You may have heard of me--I'm one of the wealthiest women in Beluslan.</p>

          <p>I was a famous beauty in my younger days, and I still break quite a few hearts, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently I found a child who lost his parents, so I've taken him in.</p>

          <p>Paeru--a little boy. He came to Beluslan with his father, and then his father disappeared.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>He hadn't any acquaintance here and no place to go, so I took him in. It's not a burden for me to care for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can take care of him until he finds his father, and if he never finds him, well, he can just stay on with me.</p>
