          <p>Achoo! Beluslan is so cold, nyerk. Lucky for you I have Mist armor to keep you warm! It is also very durable and lightweight! Protects against all kinds of things!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mist armor does dissolve back to mist, though, so keep track of how long you have. Would not want to get stuck out there without armor! Brrrr.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please buy from me, nyerk! I want to prove myself so I can be transferred somewhere warmer!</p>
