          <p>I was against this from the start, you know. Thawing Kurngalfberg! Even if we cleared every scrap of ice, the city was polluted by the Balaur! What good does it do?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that it matters. Who listens to me? I'm just here to do my job. I'll make flames and try to thaw the ice as best I can, but I can't say I like it. What a way to meet my doom.</p>
