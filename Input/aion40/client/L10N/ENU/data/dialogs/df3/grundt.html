          <p>The Shedim Lords watch over us and so, in return, we must watch over each other and the Holy Beasts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have historically not watched over the Holy Beasts as Aion would have liked, but I hope to make up for this in the future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must show the Shedim Lords that we appreciate their constant guidance and protection.</p>
