          <p>It's been a while, [%username]. It seems like only yesterday you came to me for the Daeva's ceremony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By now you've asked yourself a lot of questions. What is the reason for a Daeva's existence? Was it right for you to choose [%userclass]? How should one live an eternal life?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll look for those answers your whole life, but after the Ceremony of the Wise, you'll better understand the questions.</p>
