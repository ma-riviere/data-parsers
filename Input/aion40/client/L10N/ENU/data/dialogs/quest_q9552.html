          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_Xmasevent_001] wasn't originally a meeting event for singles. Once it celebrated that Aion had dispatched 12 Empyrean Lords to the people of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But--things changed, as they often do. A Daeva of Marriage decided to go around matchmaking for those who gathered at the festival.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now it's the festival for singles, whom we invite to join us. Or we would, if they could get their invitations.</p>

          <p>Because of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShugoSantaD_99_n]s, of course! They were supposed to deliver the festival invitations all over Asmodae, but they've all run off!</p>
