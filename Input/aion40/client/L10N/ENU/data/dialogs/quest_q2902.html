          <p>Ascension often follows a shock. A grave wound can do it, or the sight of a kinsman struck down. The destiny sleeping within you rises to meet the challenge, and by the Shedim Lords, you've got wings!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What was it for you, [%username]? What hit you so hard you awoke to Daevahood?</p>

          <p>Munin? The same Munin that was imprisoned in a crystal cage? Now I understand why there's so much gossip about you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought it was the company you used to keep. Being a raider is an example of a "colorful background," though, and heeding Munin's words is more like "heresy, if not treason."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know why Munin was exiled in the first place? The prophecies about the Thirteenth Empyrean Lord!</p>

          <p>Yes, but that's all I'm saying. There's a reason why there are empty crystal cages next to Munin's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get your head out of those prophecy-clouds, and focus on the task at hand: proving yourself. People here are going to be wary of you until you've shown yourself as a true-blooded Asmodian...especially with the likes of you-know-who among your associates.</p>

          <p>I was surprised too. Altgard's much too tough for most newly ascended Daeva, if you ask me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, you'll probably come through all right, but I expect you'll end up making the Soul Healers a lot of money on the way. You'll be begging them to send you to the Abyss before too long, I'm sure.</p>
