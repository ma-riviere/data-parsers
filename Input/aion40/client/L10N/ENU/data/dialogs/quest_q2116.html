          <p>You'll probably need to find a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2116a] or something similar. It should be a simple task to get aboard the ship. You know what to expect from the Lepharist rabble now.</p>

          <p>Hurry over to the coast and board that ship. I don't care if you sneak on or chew through every one of those treasure hunters to get aboard. The important thing is that we get that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2116a].</p>
