          <p>Lady of Light be blessed, I've crossed paths with a [%userclass]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The treasures of the temple are being threatened by those...monsters! They're everywhere, growing by the day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could really use your help here.</p>

          <p>You mean, you haven't heard the rumors, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shhh, come a little closer. There's a legend saying that this temple was built around a vast collection of ancient treasures and artifacts. Items from before the Great War.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one knows for sure, but the books of the ancients show drawings of gems and jewels, mysterious fabrics, antique weapons, secrets....</p>

          <p>Of course, I know, I know. Rumors are but whispers to the deaf, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't think twice about the rumors normally, but there have been so many heisters asking questions around here recently. I even heard the Fortuneers Legion is looking into the treasure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then I heard from a patrol sentry that some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ettin_31_An]s came across some pieces of the long-lost treasure. Would you dispose of them? Kill them, kill the secret, right? I'll make it worth your while.</p>

          <p>Don't say anything to anyone, though. If we can get those Cracktooth Ettins out of the way, I'll go in at night and start searching for the treasure.</p>

          <p>No? I heard you were the adventurous type...always looking for that next wild idea. I see they were wrong about you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be gone with you then! There are plenty more Daevas around here looking to make a little more Kinah on the side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if I hear a word about my treasure from anyone, I'm sending some friends--some big, strong friends--to look for you, [%username]!</p>

          <p>From the looks of you, I'd say those Cracktooth Ettins were a little tougher than you anticipated, eh? Did you get rid of them for me? Any sign of the treasure? Anything at all?</p>
