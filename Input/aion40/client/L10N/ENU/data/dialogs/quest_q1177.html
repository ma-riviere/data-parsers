          <p>Do you see those stones floating about? Mysterious Stones, they're called. I know--clever name, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Despite that, they're an interesting bit of local history. They used to be part of the Aetheric Field that protected what is now the Zumion Ruins. When the Balaur stormed through in the Cataclysm, they smashed all the stones near the shrine and scattered the fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>The protective field is gone now, but the stones are still full of Aether, which makes them valuable for mages.</p>

          <p>Yes. In fact, Vascus makes a living selling the fragments from these stones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He can't travel much anymore, what with that rock following him around all the time. Don't even ask how that got started....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obviously, I haven't got time to go foraging for stone bits, but maybe you do?</p>

          <p>That's kind of you. Vascus could use some cheering up.</p>

          <p>Could you gather about seven fragments? That should be plenty, for now.</p>

          <p>There are lots of the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA83]s on the path going over [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA19]. Watch out, though--the Plumas have been vicious recently, and there are weird rock monsters here and there. Nothing you can't deal with, I'm sure!</p>
