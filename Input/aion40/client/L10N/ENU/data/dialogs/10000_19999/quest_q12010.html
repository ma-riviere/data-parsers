          <p>Nothing breaks a Reian heart like treachery, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reian bonds are forged through a lifetime of trust and respect. To see our comrades turn their back on our way of life and even kill our people... there is no greater horror. Over time, we accepted these betrayals as Tiamat's meddling, but still, killing these traitors is a difficult task for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, if you can, help us in this deeply private matter. Leave for the Traitors' Hideout and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_YunFi_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_YunWi_58_An]s there.</p>

          <p>I cannot go to that place, [%username]. My brother disappeared a few years ago, and I fear he has joined their ranks. At first, I prayed for his well-being; now, I pray that he has found the Aetherstream.</p>

          <p>But you... you have no such attachments, at least here. How did you do?</p>
