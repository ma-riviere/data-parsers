          <p>I can hardly believe we've conquered this fortress. We're now one step closer to Tiamat himself, and destroying a Dragon Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, of course, the cost has been dear. We need more supplies, and having them delivered from other regions is too slow and risky. That is why we need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_12040a]s. They are used to make a wide variety of healing items.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, you can get them here by killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Fungy_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Sam_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Xipeto_Rage_58_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Twister_Aurora_60_An]s. That is your assignment.</p>

          <p>We will hold this fortress at all costs, no matter what Tiamat throws at us. It is our duty as Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Vitality Fragments I sent you for is a vital part of that effort. I hope you did not slack.</p>

          <p>Ah, yes.... I will get these to the alchemists at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With these, the Balaur will find it much more difficult to take back this Heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only all our Daevas were like you, [%username]. Both Balaur and Asmodians would be long defeated by now.</p>

          <p>After conquering the Heart of Fissure, Levis asked you to collect Vitality Fragments from local monsters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, since the Fragments were key ingredients in making potions that would help the Elyos hold onto the fortress.</p>
