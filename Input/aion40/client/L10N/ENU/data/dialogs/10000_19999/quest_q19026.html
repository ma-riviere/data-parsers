          <p>Ah, [%username]! I was just talking about you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw you working at a Handicrafting ledge the other day and realized that you've become quite skilled. Your ability to craft jewels is...extraordinary. In fact, I don't think it's the least bit inferior to my own.</p>

          <p>It's simple, you just need to create an offering as tribute to a Temple of an Empyrean Lord.</p>

          <p>Good. I was hoping you'd be interested. High Priest Eremitia from the Cloister of Kaisinel has ordered a necklace, and your style goes perfectly with the design I've come up with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're ready, go see Chiwurinerk and ask to see the necklace design and prototype.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell him that you came because of the Master test and he'll show it to you.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes! Daeva must make [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_19026].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Chiwurinerk has two designs to choose from. One design for Eremitia's Necklace, which sometimes, maybe, yields Eremitia's Noble Necklace. Nyerk. Second design for Eremitia's Noble Necklace, which gives detailed crafting instructions. Design always works if Daeva crafts successfully. Only tiny bit more Kinah for peace of mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which design does Daeva want? One? Both?</p>

          <p>Ooh! Daeva either feels very, very lucky, or has much skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, tiny additional consideration.... Eremitia's Necklace design very volatile. Only works once. Then poof! Master Utsida says he likes it that way. Keeps design private, secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So perhaps Daeva chooses to spend more Kinah, and have less stress worrying about poof? Not much more Kinah. Just tiny bit. Eremitia's Necklace is 167,500 Kinah, while design for Eremitia's Noble Necklace is a mere 223,000 Kinah. That price, it includes prototype of Eremitia's Necklace, made by Master Utsida himself.  Still want cheap risky design?</p>

          <p>Ah, what is price? Chiwurinerk will check. Hmm...design for Eremitia's Noble Necklace will cost well spent 223,000 Kinah. Design for Eremitia's Necklace mere 167,500 Kinah, but risky, risky. Comes with prototype of Eremitia's Necklace, made by best Master Utsida.</p>
