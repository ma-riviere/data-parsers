          <p>Say, what do you intend to do with Kromede's Tear? It's fine as a necklace, but it could be so much more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Combined with the Longbow of the Judge, it could become a weapon greater than either of its parts. But....</p>

          <p>You'll need three things first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is a talented blacksmith...which, thanks to me, you have. And secondly, you'll need Kromede's Tear, which you have right there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The third is obviously the Longbow of the Judge. That might be a bit sticky to get. But if you're still interested, it'll be well worth the effort.</p>

          <p>You are really lucky that I came along, [%username]. Daevas sometimes wait weeks just to speak with me about my weapon-enhancing skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not trying to brag, but few blacksmiths can do what I do. Refining a Longbow is a very delicate procedure...one slip-up, and the bow will snap like a twig.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, you'll find the Longbow of the Judge with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. She won't just give it to you.</p>
