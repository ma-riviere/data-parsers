          <p>You know how it is with inspiration. Good ideas breed!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I look at these natural bushes, and then I must sculpt them. Sculpt them out of a crystal never seen before. I will call it "Gauon's Fiery Flowers of Crystalline Repose."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, whatever I call it, I still need the base materials. Would you be able to procure a Spring Crystal, Summer Crystal, Fall Crystal, and Winter Crystal, by chance?</p>
