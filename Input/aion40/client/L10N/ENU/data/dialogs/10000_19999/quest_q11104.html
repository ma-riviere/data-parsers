          <p>Greetings, Elyos. It's been some time since I've had a good chat with one of your kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's strange how our races used to be so similar, and yet are now so...separated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, do you...uh...might you be...?</p>

          <p>Might you be headed to the Scar Canyon anytime soon?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I was there recently and ran into a few Crestliches and Pucas. I thought I could handle them, but they...handled me, I suppose you could say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I escaped, but they tore off my sack...all my belongings went flying out. I just left it all there and ran as fast as I could!</p>

          <p>Yes, very tough. Especially when they encircle you--nothing you can do but run.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I lost some ancient treasure that I was holding for Gelon.... I haven't told him yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you find the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11104a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11104b] that the Crestliches and Pucas took from me? Before Gelon finds out?</p>
