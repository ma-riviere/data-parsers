          <p>[%username]! You're one of the most powerful [%userclass]s we have. Do you have time to go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S8]? One of my men, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anon], just sent an urgent request from help. It seems as though the Naduka have learned how to fight.</p>

          <p>[%username]! You're the backup Acacia sent? This is excellent news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Naduka Legion have been crashing against our ramparts over and over again. Our defenses are wavering, and if we dont push back, we'll be forced all the way back to Sarpan. I need your help. I need you to enter their compound, and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanFi_Tiamat_59_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanSc_Tiamat_59_Ae]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanWi_Tiamat_59_Ae] units, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanCl_Tiamat_59_Ae]s you find there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now, while there's still time. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>The Naduka Legion will be forced onto the back foot for a while. As they tend to their wounded, we'll have time to repair our defences, and reinforce our numbers.</p>

          <p>Acacia received an urgent request for backup from the Naduka Legion Garrison. You went to the post and met with a Daeva there, Aranon. He tasked you with bringing the Naduka numbers down, which you readily agreed to do.</p>
