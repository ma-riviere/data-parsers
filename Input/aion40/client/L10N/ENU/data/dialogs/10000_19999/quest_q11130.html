          <p>Greetings again, [%username]. You're familiar with the Angrief Gate, yes? It was built after we drove out the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But some Balaur have remained there--how and why, I do not know. Just a few at first, so we ignored them, but there are so many of them now that we have to do something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Basrasa Workers, Basrasa Healers, and Basrasa Deathwalkers are everywhere now. And to make matters worse, some Collector Spallers have begun to spring up as well.</p>

          <p>Ha ha ha! We tried that, Daeva. Instead of reinforcements, Sanctum sent us those damned Mithril coins! We needed experienced soldiers and we get currency! And it wasn't even Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see what Sanctum was trying to do--they wanted us to use the Mithril to entice Daevas here in Inggison to fight. Not a bad idea...had it been Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you get rid of the Balaur and the Collector Spallers at the Mephistis Farm, I will give you plenty of these damned Mithril coins.</p>

          <p>A statue should be built in your likeness, [%username]! From what I gathered, the Balaur were originally sent there by Tiamat--probably still there because they're too afraid to leave!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So they possess the mark of Tiamat's order. The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_11130a]s will be the proof I need so I can pay you...orders straight from my superiors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, that proof contains a bit of Aether. So buy me a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Junk_redeem_jewelry_02a] so I can refine the Aether. I'll reimburse you with Mithril coins for that too.</p>
