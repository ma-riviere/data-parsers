          <p>When I was little, mom made lots of food!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She would make [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11116b] and store them in a big hole under the house. It was really cold and scary down there, but I could eat as many as I wanted!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if I was really good, she would buy me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11116c]s. I...I miss her cooking. Sniff...I miss her!</p>

          <p>Nice looking Mookie Needles. You'll be wanting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11116b]? Odd request from a Daeva, but there's no accounting for taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wonderful preservation method. The Shulacks make them in the spring and store them in cold cellars. Keeps them crunchy all year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for the Thorns. I'll use those to make my next batch. Here, take this. This batch came out particularly well. They're salty with just a hint of Mela and bog bitters.</p>

          <p>Ah, always a favorite. Children love them, but dentists, not so much.</p>
