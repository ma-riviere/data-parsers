          <p>Hey, [%username]. Have you talked to that Mookie over there yet? Yeah, Squip. No? Perfect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, she was being held by the Shulacks in Rokoros Village, but she managed to escape. Which is good for her, since those Shulacks eat Mookies. Can you imagine? Ugh! It's great that she escaped, but the details of the story sound a bit fishy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, have you ever been to Rokoros Village? It's a long trek through a Pluma-infested valley. How the heck did one tiny Mookie managed to get through that valley unscathed?</p>

          <p>Hmm...good point. There are geysers around Inggison that emit some wickedly strong windstreams. I've heard stories about Daevas riding them, but I always figured it was a load of Mau droppings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If there's a windstream around here that leads to Rokoros Village, I have no idea where it might be. But it could explain how Squip got through that valley in one piece.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tuca_01] hasn't spoken to me since I mentioned that I love Mookie dishes. Stop making faces! I just meant that they're great cooks! Which is obviously not how she took it. Could you try talking to her? See if she'll tell you about the windstream?</p>

          <p>You sure you don't eat Mookie? Hmmm? In that case, pull up a stump and get off those spindly leg things. It's disconcerting watching you wobble about. I bet you're looking for the windstream to Rokoros Village. Huh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>OK then. What you want is to go find Grandfather Starturtle. He's the ancient [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A5_BigStarturtle_52_n] who lives North of Dimaia Fountainhead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Below where he sits is the crevice where the windstream to Rokoros Village starts. It's a nice ride, but a terrible tourist destination.</p>

          <p>So, there's a giant Starturtle obscuring the geyser? Interesting. This I've got to see.</p>

          <p>Armond was daydreaming about riding windstreams to Rokoros Village. He asked you to ask Squip about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Squip told you about a windstream under the Starturtle that leads to the village. When you informed Armond of this, he was both stunned and elated.</p>
