          <p>Just a shame to let Kromede's Tear be wasted like that, [%username]. Sure, it's pretty and useful, but it could be so much more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you melt it down and blend it with the Staff of the Judge, you'll have the kind of weapon that legends are born from!</p>

          <p>Well, you'll need three things before we can begin: Kromede's Tear, the Staff of the Judge, and a very gifted blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first item and, with my well-known abilities, you have the third thing. You just need the staff now. If you can get that, I'll take care of the rest.</p>
