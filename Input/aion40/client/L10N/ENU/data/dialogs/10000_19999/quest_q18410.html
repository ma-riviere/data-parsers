          <p>All right, I can brief you now. Just remember that everything I'm about to tell you is strictly confidential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We tried everything to track the disappearing prisoners. We even disguised ourselves as captives with tracking spells. No success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then, this portal here opened out of nowhere, and a Reian came out of it.</p>

          <p>He said he was from some place called the Esoterrace, and that he knew where our Balaur prisoners went.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, they used this very portal, which was hidden by some very sophisticated cloaking spells, at least until the Reian revealed it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wanted to go in, but I'm not trained for the combat I'd probably be facing. You, on the other hand, look like you could handle yourself....</p>

          <p>Welcome aboard. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nepion] is the name of the Reian I met. He said he'd be waiting on the other side of the portal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest talking to him first. Report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Antigone] once your mission is complete.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also suggest taking some allies. I don't know anything about this place, but I'm sure it's bad news.</p>

          <p>This place is called the Esoterrace. It alone is responsible for over half of the Drana produced in Tiamat's territories.</p>

          <p>Go to the cliff nearby. My friends will open a Windstream to Narayama Canyon, at the base of the Esoterrace.</p>

          <p>Keep the Image Marble. I suggest taking it to your superiors. It will help in your investigation of the Esoterrace.</p>
