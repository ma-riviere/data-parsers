          <p>Those Klaws...a worthy adversary, Daeva. Perfect killing machines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Especially now, after being introduced to Drana...their killing skills have sharpened. Their attacks have been galvanized in ferocity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oddly enough, they remind me of myself after my first year on the battlefields.... My senses were sharp then, my muscles were tight, my blade...like nothing you've ever seen, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Their fighting skills remind me of my own--that's a better way to put it. We're both ferocious fighters, although I've grown a little rusty since they put me on research duty out here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But those Klaws...they even shed their skin. It's like me taking off my armor after battle. I heard from some locals that they go inside a cave to do it. I'd sure like to get my hands on some of their shells before they shed, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Partly to check them for Drana, but also because I'd like to add their shells to my collection of Klaw keepsakes. Any chance you could help me out? I'll pay you well.</p>

          <p>Ah, faith and arms, Daeva! That's great news! I'd go myself but...well, I'm stationed here for a reason. A very good reason.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Head over to the cave and kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Neut_Workerhigh_53_An]s. Their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11127a]s should be pretty easy to remove--they haven't shed yet, so it should slide right off the bone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about 14 shells? That should be plenty.</p>

          <p>I'll use a few for my research, but the rest are going into my collection. I've fancied the idea of opening a small museum in Sanctum for the artifacts of all my battles.</p>
