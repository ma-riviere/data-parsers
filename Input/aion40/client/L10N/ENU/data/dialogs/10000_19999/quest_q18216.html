          <p>Have you tried the Crucible Coliseum yet, [%username]? If you haven't, I think this new Crucible is going to blow you away! I mean, not literally... unless you're really, really bad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm offering Platinum Medals to those who have taken on the challenge of the Coliseum, not that I think you'll need the extra encouragement.</p>

          <p>Well, aside from the sheer thrill of a close-matched fight against worthy Daevas, it's great practice, and you'll be earning rewards as you go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen you in action, [%username], and I know you're highly competitive. I think you're ready for a Daeva Deathmatch, don't you?</p>

          <p>Great! Your successes in the Coliseum earn you [%dic:STR_DIC_I_COIN_ARENA_PVP_01]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_COIN_ARENA_01]s. I'll take them in trade for Platinum Medals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, if you have any on you right now, I'm happy to take them off your hands.</p>

          <p>So you have 400 Courage Insignias and 9,800 Crucible Insignias. Pricey, maybe, but surely someone of your skills can earn them back in no time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just a warning, though: I don't give refunds.</p>

          <p>No, it's 400 Courage Insignias and 9,800 Crucible Insignias. Maybe I forgot to mention that? Well, either way, you don't have enough.</p>

          <p>... 9,798... 9,799... 9,800! One Platinum Medal for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This'll get you a ton of respect, you know. And if anyone insinuates you bought it instead of earning it... send them to me! I'll tell them how you snuck up on that one Daeva, and took out that other one as if by accident.</p>

          <p>...What? Oh, it WAS an accident? Well, you don't need to tell anyone else that.</p>
