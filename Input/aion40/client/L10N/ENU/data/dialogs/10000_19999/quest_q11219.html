          <p>If you look at the costumes and monuments in Hanarkand, you can see that the village is clearly Tiamat's. It bears all of his marks, tastes and symbols.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But look at this staff! The engravings imply wind, but Tiamat's symbol is earth. Why would priests in one of Tiamat's villages carry symbols of wind?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried to research why, but couldn't find any connection.</p>

          <p>Maybe another Dragon Lord has influence in this area? Or the village follows some Brigade General--under Tiamat--who is important enough to have an identifying symbol?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their village leader, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanWi_noble_NamedQ_55_Ae], must know what's going on, but obviously I can't interview him. We can, however, see if he's recorded anything.</p>

          <p>On my last foray into the field, I saw Zanuta talk with some priests and then scratch something onto his crystal. Maybe [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11219a] will reveal the truth.</p>
