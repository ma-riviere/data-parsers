          <p>Daeva, I must ask you for a favor--it is urgent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmodians have discovered Silentera Canyon...Inggison is no longer safe! Our bases are no longer safe! They have a direct artery into the heart of our operations.</p>

          <p>I fear it is too late to send out more troops--the attack is underway. It would be a disaster if the Temple of Scales and the Altar of Avarice fell to the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to get out there and do what you can to save our bases and help [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_2111_Boss_Li_1] the Agent. She will only lend her strength once we fail...once our bases are lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know she'll need the help of a great [%userclass] such as yourself.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I knew I could count on you. But before you leave for Inggison Outpost, see Ordnance Quartermaster Jondas to purchase the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11129a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if the outpost has truly fallen to the Asmodians, use the Blessing of Concentration on Veille's Aether Concentrator.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because if Veille's Aether Concentrator receives over 100 blessings, she'll be able to use the Empyrean Avatar...so perform the blessing at least 10 times.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I only say this because it is you I will mention by name if we should lose Inggison Outpost, or if harm should befall his favorite disciple.</p>
