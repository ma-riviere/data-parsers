          <p>Since you're here, could you do me a favor? I need to find out if [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11031a] is edible. Could you locate some for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was going to ask Delus, but he's been sick for a few days now. I brought him some sun-roasted grass cakes but he said he was too weak to eat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're really getting backed up here. I'm supposed to have an entire menu ready for the fortress, but the only dish I have now is an old Shulack recipe.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I really think those plump, juicy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A4_Fellial_Dr_51_An] petals will be a delicious ingredient for my next dish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It smells good, that much I know. And it shouldn't be poisonous...according to a few Shugos I spoke with. Well, I guess we'll find out after you find the petals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll tell Delus to get his appetite ready for the next taste test.</p>
