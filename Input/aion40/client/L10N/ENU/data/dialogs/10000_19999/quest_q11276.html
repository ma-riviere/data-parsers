          <p>Hey, sorry about sending you way over to Conqueror's Ravine, but it's the closest place to harvest Ensouled Aether. Really.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I had more time, I'm sure I could figure out how open a new Stigma slot with materials I have on hand. But, between surfing the Windstreams and the backlog of Stigmas I'm working on, there's just never enough time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I see you have enough Ensouled Aether now to do the trick. Way to stick with it!</p>

          <p>I can't be certain this will work, but I'm pretty sure we're as prepared as we're going to be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we just need to dive in and give it a go! I love this part!</p>

          <p>Ok then...you might want to shield your eyes for this first part...this is kind of bright.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hold out your hands. Now take this orb. It'll be warm. It's full of pure refined Ensouled Aether. Assuming I refined it right, which I did. I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, take a deep breath...hold...and release....</p>

          <p>All right. The orb has stopped glowing. I think we're done. Open your eyes...and you can get down off the counter now....</p>

          <p>So, did it work? Go ahead. Check your Stigma slot.</p>

          <p>Heh! Sweet! It worked! I knew it would! Well, I knew it might, but when it works, that's the same thing. I hope the new Stigma slot helps you, [%username]. It's been a pleasure working with you.</p>
