          <p>[%username], mind if I ask you for a favor? It shouldn't take too much of your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Firenon] was supposed to send me Magical Aether for repairing the ship, you see. I say supposed to, because nothing's arrived yet. I want to make sure everything's all right, but can't go and see him directly. Not when there's much to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you go and ask him why it's taking so long?</p>

          <p>What? The Magical Aether?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I gave it to Pogrunerk to sell, as per Filatyon's orders. Look here. I still have the letter. It says... it says... oh. Oh no! I thought it said I had to sell it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4a_09], which I did! Oh no! Please, maybe Pogrunerk still has some left in stock, but you'd have to hurry!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, check for me! I can't believe I did that!</p>

          <p>Made 100,000 Kinah too! Not bad effort for few hours of work, yes yes? Money isn't mine though, and can only give it to Firon.</p>

          <p>That's ridiculous! I told Firon to sell all his stock EXCEPT the Aether! Oh, for the five! This is terrible, terrible news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're going to have to buy new supplies, and we'll have to report this to Sanctum. Firon will be in a great deal of trouble....</p>

          <p>Filatyon wanted to know why Firon hadn't delivered the Magical Aether needed for essential ship repairs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It turned out that the Magical Aether was sold at a giveaway price thanks to Firon's mistake. Filatyon was disgusted when he heard the news, and implied Firon was in a for a rude awakening once they reached port.</p>
