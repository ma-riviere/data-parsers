          <p>Ugh! Can you smell that? That stench... it goes right up my nose and... and crawls out through my eyeballs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Happens twice a year, that smell. The male [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_SpakyButterfly_56_n]s start their mating rituals, and impress females by rubbing their wings against trees and vegetation.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>The smell attracts the females, apparently, though you'd have to be some masochist to find that reek alluring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, as luck would have it, we happen to be downwind of the Moskie habitat, and as much as I try to accept their ways, I'm sure they won't mind if we were to kill a few of them. Could you help?</p>

          <p>Ristiel, a researcher at the Kamar Road Outpost, had problems with the nearby Moskies. It was mating season, and they were leaving behind all manner of scents to attract each other. While the smell attracted, it was incredibly pungent to Reian noses, so you went to whittle their numbers down a little.</p>
