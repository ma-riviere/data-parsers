          <p>I have spoken to the council of elders, and we are very disappointed in this latest Elyos treachery. If I had my way, I'd banish you all from Sarpan now. However, the others have asked me to put aside my anger so that we can concentrate on getting Siel's Relics back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to know what Israphel plans to do with them. All these years he's been plotting, using the powers granted to him as an Empyrean Lord to further his plan in secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we must scramble to catch up.</p>

          <p>Of course. Your task now is to obtain Siel's Relics. [%username], I want to believe that you are different from the other Elyos. Your support of the Reians had certainly shown it to be so. But I am still wary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask you to share all your information with us, and to act only in concert with us from now on. We must work together to get back the relics, or we will all lose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To that end, go and speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Killios]. I hear he has a clue to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel]'s whereabouts.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. It's you, [%username]! I have been waiting for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Cloister of Kaisinel has sent us the readings for a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10071a], which they found in the Throne of Blood after Israphel was there. We might be able to use it to figure out where he went.</p>

          <p>Oh, and when she's done with them, make sure to ask for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10071a] readings back. You got that?</p>

          <p>It's very strong! Lord Israphel must have created it himself, as a safeguard against intruders. But don't worry, I can undo it. Good thing you came right back, though--if you'd have been much later, I think it might have been permanent!</p>

          <p>I'm saying this because I trust you, but I really need to know if you hear anything that could threaten the alliance between the Elyos and the Reians. We can't afford to jeapordize it now.</p>
