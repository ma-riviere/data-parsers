          <p>He received a report from Raninia about what you saw in Kromede's Trial. He wishes to confirm these visions are Asmodian in origin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because if they are, then the counterfeit Stigmas are probably also from Asmodae, which would have certain...security implications.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry to even ask this, but would you go back inside [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede] and find out more about the location? I was told to ask you.</p>

          <p>Excellent. I'll tell the Brigade General the good news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The report also mentioned that the nightmare would only end when [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCromede_Named_Judge_38_An] is killed. So, since you're going back inside [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede], you get to kill him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must put a stop to this nightmare once and for all, [%username]! I've been ordered to give you a Silver Coin for your troubles, too.</p>
