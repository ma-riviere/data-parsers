          <p>That was my theory, too! This shadow-plagued climate! So I figured, since I can't change the climate, I'll just cover everything with leather blankets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have to be thin, though. And made of strong enough leather. I need a...particular type. Only the best for my warehouse, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need...Baku hide! Baku hide is strong, thin, and it looks so elegant. Might I...might I ask you to procur some Baku hide for me, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Ah, Sun's Blessing, [%username]! But avoid the area outside the Scars of the Earth, would you? Everything's tainted by Petrification there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Petrification makes the leather crack easily, and if it cracks, dust will seep in. And if dust seeps in, well...you know how I feel about dust.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hide of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Baku_Giraffe_53_n] is most likely the best. Has a nice shine to it. Can you get some of that for me?</p>
