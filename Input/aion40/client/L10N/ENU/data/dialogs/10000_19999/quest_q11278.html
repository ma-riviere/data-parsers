          <p>Now that the Manastone Removers Association has become unionized, we're able to offer all sorts of glorious deals for our clients, and help contribute to our society at the same time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your charitable contribution of MP +70, Evasion +14, and Parry +22 manastone bundles will touch the lives of many, many impoverished Daevas...once they pay a small fee in lieu of union dues, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So...do you have 10 of any of those manastones I mentioned? Maybe in your cube or warehouse?</p>

          <p>The M.R.A. has quickly become one of the fastest growing charitable organizations around, thanks to the principles of unionizing...which we learned from the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Creepy little things, but they sure know how to conduct commerce! Business is good, but an untouchable business is better!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, your contribution of 10 MP +70, Evasion +14, and Parry +22 manastones will surely save a Daeva in need. So...hand them over. Let's make some Daeva's dream come true.</p>

          <p>Hmm, I guess I wasn't clear enough in my three-minute diatribe of what the M.R.A. is looking for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bundles, Daeva! Bundles of 10! I need MP +70, Evasion +14, and Parry +22 manastones. Single manastones don't do anything for the destitute these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No bundle, no special deal. End of story. Come back when you're serious about...helping others.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, I'll just exchange these for your new manastones now. There you go. Walk in the light. In that direction.</p>
