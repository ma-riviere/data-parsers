          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I've missed your company.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish you could have joined me. I spent the night with the Seafoam Energy and Excura Energy you brought, and I've almost finished analyzing them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From the results so far, they're almost identical to the materials we receive from Sanctum...of course, "almost" can be disastrous in Alchemy!</p>

          <p>I'd like to get a second opinion on this. It'll require some travel, though.</p>

          <p>Excellent. It shouldn't take long, and when you get back, we can...you know...relax...catch up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But back to business: I need you to ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Veloso] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ambrosini] if the density difference between the Seafoam Energy acquired in Inggison, and the one sent from Sanctum, would cause problems in manufacturing Illusion Spheres.</p>

          <p>With a difference of nearly double, the particles are either heavier or smaller. Perhaps with half of the specified amount...hmmm.... No.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is what I think. I think it should be safe enough for personal Alchemical experiments, but it's too risky for making Illusion Spheres.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, it's an interesting discovery. I wonder what other properties differ within in this species.</p>

          <p>Well, good! Whatever that regurgitator of genius said, it's my opinion too. Now let me get back to some real work so scholars like Veloso will have better texts to reference in the future.</p>

          <p>You know how it is. I'll just send a letter of apology to Ambred later.</p>

          <p>Veloso, though.... So he thinks using the local Seafoam Energy is too risky? I'll have to tell poor, desperate Phailos. We can still use the Excura Energy, though, so I suppose not all is lost.</p>
