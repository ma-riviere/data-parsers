          <p>Most Daevas of Zephyr were dispatched here to Heiron with the sole glorious purpose of studying either the Balaur or the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess you could say that I got the...dirty end of the stick. I was chosen for undead duty. I'd trade in a heartbeat for Balaur duty, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could honestly care less what sends zombies back to the flow of Aether...I just want them gone!</p>

          <p>They've put me in charge of this whole shadow-cursed area, [%username]! I'm but a single Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my superiors don't want to hear that. They just want to hear that I've found out how to destroy zombies in a simple and quick fashion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any chance I could get you to go to Orton Farm and get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Banshee_37_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Bookie_37_An]s again for me? I'd pay you.</p>
