          <p> </p>
          <p>Not yet, anyway. But I see something in you... a very tiny, miniscule, mote of potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might, MIGHT, have what it takes to become a Construction Expert.</p>

          <p>You'll take my compliments and like them, soldier! Now, you need to make [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_SKILL_MENUI_299b].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's my design, so I'll KNOW if you screw it up! Skilled artisans should be able to make it, so YOU'LL find it a challenge!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, you can only be an Expert in two crafting disciplines, so you'll have to cancel any other Expert test you're taking. You ready, you mewling kitten?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The inferior design takes less material to make, but you'll have to invest more skill and luck. Don't ask me what to do; make your own choice!</p>
