          <p>To say that we Elyos differ from our enemies is to speak the obvious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To say that we differ because we nurture the sparks of energy in our citizens, that is Elyos insight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've called you here because of the strong impression you make, the innate leadership qualities I see in you.</p>

          <p>I think you have the potential to be a leader. Greatness doesn't spring fully formed but requires opportunity and conflict to shape it, otherwise it fades into obscurity and perishes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I give you opportunity and can only hope you'll use it wisely. I've told High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jucleas] and Commander [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lavirintos] about your potential, and they want to see this Daeva who has caught my eye.</p>

          <p>He recommended you to High Priest Eremitia of the Cloister of Kaisinel. Unfortunately, Mysteris wouldn't let you see her.</p>
