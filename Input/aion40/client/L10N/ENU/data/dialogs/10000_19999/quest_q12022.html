          <p>Important as it is to keep an edge on the Asmos, the real mission here is to defeat Tiamat's legions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the two aren't mutually exclusive. The more we fight and prove our strength, the more those darklings cower before us. It helps to convince the Reians of our prowess as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a meeting with the Reian brass soon. I want to present them with as many [%dic:STR_DIC_I_tiamat_banner_01]s as possible, so go take them off of the Legions in Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>

          <p>Good, you're just in time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have that strategy meeting with the Reians later today. I really want to rub our success here in the Asmodian's faces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How many Legionary's Epaulets did you bring?</p>

          <p>Oh... Yes, these will do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not an overwhelming number, like I'd hoped, but the Reians will still be impressed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't wait to humiliate those Asmodian bats!</p>
