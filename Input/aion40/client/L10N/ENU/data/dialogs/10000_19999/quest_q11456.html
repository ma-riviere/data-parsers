          <p>As you know, [%username], Aether is the source of all life and power in Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so important, in fact, that many Daevas devote their entire lives to studying it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But few have proper knowledge of Aether itself. Many Daevas think it's better to have more than less of it...which is a big misunderstanding.</p>

          <p>As with most things in this world, what's important is the balance. Like the balance between us and the Asmodians, land and water, life and death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too little Aether is not good, but too much of it is also a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Abyss is a perfect example of this. Those hideous Draconutes...they are believed to have been Drakan at one time.</p>

          <p>Yes, exactly. Inggison has many mutated creatures here...and the high Aether levels are to blame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe the same thing happened to Taloc. Or, perhaps, Taloc was the reason...the insects feeding off of his tainted Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you get rid of some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11048_1F] for me? It'll both preserve safe Aether levels and make my research easier.</p>

          <p>Wonderful, wonderful, [%username]. Exterminating some of the insects inside Taloc is an important step in getting proper Aether in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you kill 100 [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11048_1F]s, I'll give you a small gift when you come back.</p>

          <p>Yes, I know, it is a dangerous task I ask of you. But it's also very important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Excessive Aether is definitely not good for us, but you won't be in there long enough for it to harm you.</p>
