          <p>I ran from the safety of the fortress back then, excited to face the unknown.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I was immediately confronted by a pack of Balaur. Ha! I was so green back then I barely dispatched them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm, those Balaur were really angry after being defeated in battle by Empyrean Lord Kaisinel.</p>

          <p>But installing Obelisks right in front of Tiamat? You're right I jumped at the chance to do good and flick my wings at a Balic god.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did the fortress send you to support me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Great! Then please get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A5_VaranusAlligator_51_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Shellizard_Feeler_51_An]s getting in the way of installing the Obelisks.</p>
