          <p>An alliance is forged, but I question its wisdom already.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's arrogance is reflected in his people. They seem to think us weak, but they will soon be proven wrong. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kutos] of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_KarunProtect] has asked for the aid of an Elyos Daeva. Your bravery and competence will prove our strength to the Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You represent all of Elysea. Be sure to keep that in mind as you execute your duties.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a dangerous land full of terrible creatures, and the threat of the Balaur is always near. We do not have the luxury of security. You must always be on your guard.</p>

          <p>Kamar's dungeon is dug deep beneath the city. Recently some burrowing Klaw tunneled in there on accident, linking their warren to our prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some Dragonbound prisoners used the opportunity to escape into the Klaw caverns. I suspect that they haven't found a way out yet. Those burrows are easy to get lost in, and the Dragonbound are often more brawn than brains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like you to flush out the Dragonbound from the Mephitic Caverns in the dungeon. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cleyos], the Dungeon Manager, has more information.</p>

          <p>Kutos sent you? Finally!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He doesn't seem to understand that a prison needs guards, so he keeps reassigning my men. But of course it's my fault when something goes wrong! We have to get down there before the Dragonbound find their way out of the caverns. Go and pick off the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Q10050all] until [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FanaticFi_QNmd_56_An] appears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's something of a hero to the Dragonbound. You see... well, we don't have time for a history lesson now. Trust me, killing him will really demoralize the Dragonbound, so go do it!</p>

          <p>Killios sent you to Kutos, Brigade General of the Kahrun Guard, to prove the power of Elyos conviction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kutos, in turn, sent you to aid Cleyos, manager of Kamar's dungeon. You hunted the Dragonbound prisoners who had escaped into the Mephitic Caverns. Finally, you killed the Dragonbound leader, Provocateur Kaylis, greatly impressing Kutos.</p>
