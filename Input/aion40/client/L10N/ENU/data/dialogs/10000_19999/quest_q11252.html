          <p>Good, good. You've arrived. Kaisinel's Agent Veille recommended you to me. She said your help enabled her to turn back the darkness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So she wants me to give you an important mission, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I say, "[%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3011_A]" and "[%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3021_A]," you can guess the mission, yes?</p>

          <p>Let me tell you about the reward first! If you've got Laestrygos's Spellbook, I'm sure you've found it more than useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course! All Laestrygos's goods are useful. But you know whose are even better? Anusis! And when you successfully complete this mission, I'll ask Anusis to imbue your spellbook with a more powerful essence. He'll do it for me. We were close once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ready for action? For Veille? For Elysea? For improved spellcasting?</p>
