          <p>You helped me to find more about Tiamat's laboratory, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's where they studied the source of energy that will replace Idgel. They were extracting bio-energy from the mutant test subjects into which Ide was injected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a scholar who studies ancient weapons, I am really curious about the energy. Can you extract the mutated bio-energy from the remaining test subjects whose energy hasn't been extracted yet? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be an easy task since the test subjects had Ide injections. However, you can conquer them if you utilize their strength and weakness.</p>

          <p>Oh. Is this the bio-energy you've extracted from the test subjects?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am curious to see how much power it has.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will be truly a great achievement if we can use it for ancient weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to go and check it out right away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, gee. I was too happy to even say thank you. Thank you so much for bringing this. </p>
