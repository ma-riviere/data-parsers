          <p>Finally! Sanctum is almost ready to authorize the start of Operation Murder All the Balaur in Raksang! Not that they actually call it that, of course; that's MY name for it. Because that's what I intend to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All they want is one final sweep of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksah_2F_DrakanFighterCBone_56_Ae] to make sure the mission is a success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been waiting for this so long, I'm going to give you a special reward if you fight those Balaur posthaste!</p>

          <p>Oh hohohoho! Look out, Balaur, here comes Lagia, Bringer of Bloody Death!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's about time, too! With Kahrun keeping us from giving the furbacks the butt-kicking they deserve, my skills were rusting!</p>

          <p>Take this, with my thanks. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some warming up to do!</p>
