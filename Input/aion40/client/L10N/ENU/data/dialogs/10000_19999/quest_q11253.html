          <p>There is only one Daeva who can handle a Piece of Aegis. The greatest craftsman, one who can work with damned unpredictable materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I speak of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis], master craftsman of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unless his prices have changed, his rates start at 8,000,000 Kinah. That is nothing compared to having an enhanced spellbook, yes? You should go to him now. Say "arieluma" for me.</p>

          <p>We knew each other once, you know, in Artisans Hall. We ate together, crafted together, played together. For a while, we lived together too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he would get impatient, and I would get sad. It was not good, not healthy. That's why I came out here to live. I needed to get away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let his impatience bother you. He is the best of the best. You couldn't ask for a better craftsman, and YOU are a paying customer!</p>
