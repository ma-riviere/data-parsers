          <p>You found a Mithril Ring with Suleion's name incribed on it. When you returned it to him, he gave you a vintage book in thanks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The book turned out to be a first edition of "The Gloomy Days of a Girl". Geta was weirdly thrilled by this and gave you a Treasure Map for it. He assured you that Oconerk would buy the map at a high price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sadly, Oconerk didn't have that much money, even though he did want to buy the Treasure Map. You sold it to him anyway because you're a nice Daeva.</p>
