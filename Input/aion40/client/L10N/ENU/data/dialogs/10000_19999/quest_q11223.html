          <p>When I first came to the Inggison Illusion Fortress, it didn't feel at all like I was in Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The air was crisp and clear, and the forest more beautiful than I could have imagined. It was the same with Calmheart Grove and Taloc's Forest...just beautiful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But here in Hanarkand, at this Temple of Scales, it feels as though I'm officially in Balaurea. I have arrived.</p>

          <p>Aether, usually. But the lack of Aether here makes it difficult...if not impossible.</p>

          <p>What I would give, [%username], for just one glass of Elemental Water. Not the stuff alchemists make...but the real stuff extracted from Water Spirits.</p>
