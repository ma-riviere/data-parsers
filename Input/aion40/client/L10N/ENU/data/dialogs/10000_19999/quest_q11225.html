          <p>It wasn't too long ago that a small legion was annihilated in Hanarkand. It was no legion of Lord Kaisinel, just a motley crew of pilgrims looking to make a home for themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All but three of them died. One of those survivors was a Templar and he said--I'll always remember this--he said to me:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"If only we had killed the Voyeur Ashulagens first...."</p>

          <p>The Voyeur Ashulagens. They brutally slayed that small legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nobody blamed the Templar, but he sure blamed himself. I'd like to get revenge for that poor soldier...for that whole legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you do all of us a favor and kill off those bloody Voyeur Ashulagens?</p>

          <p>They patrol the roads like shadows. And when they see an intruder, they attack. They're not very intelligent, but they're brutal.</p>
