          <p>Our campaign against the Esoterrace is by no means complete. More must be done. Always more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The next step is taking Surkana. Without their precious energy source, the Balaur will be hard pressed.</p>

          <p>Hah, yes.... It's nice to see the enemy with resource problems for a change, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, Surkana is apparently stored in boxes at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_idf4re_drana_SZ_Stage_02_1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your duty would be to go there and raid those boxes for the Surkana. Ready to complete this task?</p>

          <p>Thanks to you, we'll have the Esoterrace Balaur running as efficiently as a Shugo legion. Hah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, security will be tight in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_idf4re_drana_SZ_Stage_02_1], doubly so around the Surkana.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make sure you and your allies are well-equipped and prepared to deal with multiple powerful foes.</p>

          <p>The Surkana Boxes stored in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_idf4re_drana_SZ_Stage_02_1] may be small, but they contain much Surkana.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish we could get our hands on all of it, but that's impossible. We take what we can. Or are supposed to.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I'm no expert, but this doesn't look like any Surkana I've ever seen. Its power seems much more concentrated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No wonder the Surkana boxes were so small. Even this paltry amount could power multiple Dredgions.</p>

          <p>We've struck a serious blow against Tiamat today. Take this reward with Ariel's blessings.</p>
