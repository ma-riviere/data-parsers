          <p>I'm the eldest! It is MY job to take care of her. Mother died, and Father...this big Elyos saved his life and got exiled for helping him. Only Setzkiki and I are left.</p>

          <p>You see? I must find her food. I must keep her warm.... Will you help?</p>

          <p>We need a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11115all].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She needs food. Anything would help, but Fabius sells her favorites, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shop_food_hpregen_20a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shop_food_mpregen_20a]. Those would make her feel better? Right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And...and warmth. I need [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B3_Rottentree_Green_53_An] to make a fire and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B3_Hellhound_Wolf_53_An] skin to make her a warm bed. Kind Daeva, can you help me get all of that?</p>

          <p>I would gather the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B3_Hellhound_Wolf_53_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B3_Rottentree_Green_53_An] myself, but I can not leave Setzkiki.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is embarrassing to ask you to buy food for us...but I am sure [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fabius]'s [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shop_food_hpregen_20a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shop_food_mpregen_20a] will help her! Thank you! Thank you!</p>
