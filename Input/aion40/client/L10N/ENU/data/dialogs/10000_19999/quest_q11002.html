          <p>How dare they treat me this way!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum sent me to research Inggison's ecology, but can the Legionaries be bothered to clear Calmheart Grove?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No! They look down on Daevas of Life because we don't follow Lord Kaisinel.</p>

          <p>Don't you try to put my hackles up further, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went to Calmheart Grove today to compare creatures inside and outside the Aetheric Field. And these strange looking things attacked me! Clearly, my research was stopped for the day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came back bleeding, clothes torn, hands ripped to shreds, and asked the Hushblade Legion and the Sanctum Expeditionary Force for help, but they said they had more important things to do. Drak-loving trogs. Would you help me instead? This would be so easy for you.</p>

          <p>That'll take them down a wingspan, show them that Daevas of Life can do this alone. Hah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It should be simple for someone of your caliber. Just get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Cellatu_Frogbaby_51_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Bat_Dolphin_51_n]s in Calmheart Grove.</p>

          <p>Opilius said he can't do his ecology research because the Cellatus and Murmurs keep getting in his way. Since the Hushblade Legion and the Sanctum Expeditionary Force wouldn't help him, he turned to you.</p>
