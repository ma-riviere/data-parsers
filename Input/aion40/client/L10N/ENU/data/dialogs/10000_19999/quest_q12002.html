          <p>The Balaur forces seem endless. We just can't catch a moment's peace!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That Balaur Cavalry Base is a growing threat. A decisive blow must be made to weaken their forces.</p>

          <p>I was ready. I thought I knew what awaited me in Tiamaranta. But I find myself burdened with doubt, and I fear my injuries only make the situation worse.</p>

          <p>This is truly good to hear. By Siel's Spear, you have been a great help, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard to accept one's frailties, but I could not have done as much in my current condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you. May Kahrun watch over you.</p>
