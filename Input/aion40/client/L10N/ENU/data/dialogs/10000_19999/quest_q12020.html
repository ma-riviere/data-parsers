          <p>There are so many powerful relics buried here. And those Drakan of the Satra Legion keep showing up for them, digging around for whatever they can find. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Kahrun's Eyes, [%userrace], we have to protect the artifacts from those terrible Balaur. Imagine if Tiamat was to control them, pervert them! There would be untold devastation and suffering!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must attack now! Before they can better organize. You must go to the Satra Legion Garrison and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_DrakanFi_Noble_60_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_DrakanSc_Noble_60_An]s.</p>

          <p>You met Materia who was worried that the Drakan of the Satra Legion kept attacking the Siel's Temple Ruins. She asked you to get rid of them in order to protect the unearthed relics, keeping them out of Tiamat's grasp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You invaded the Satra Legion Garrison and killed the Combat Officers and Search Specialists you found. Materia appreciated your efforts, saying that the ruins would be safe for a while.</p>
