          <p>Ah, [%username]! I was hoping to see you. I have an interesting little task for you, if you've time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard an interesting story while interrogating one of our Strigik prisoners. You see, it turns out there are two major parliament families in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Owllau_fam]. These families despise each other, and only support the same tribe because they know they're too weak to survive alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, while the two had been keeping their distance, it seems two owlets from the rival families have taken a liking to each other! If someone--someone like you, maybe--were to interfere in their affairs, the Urugugu Tribe would be thrown into chaos, and we'd finally be rid of the trouble that they cause!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_03] and find [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_05]. That's where you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Owlau_LDF4a_01], the love-struck daughter of one of the families. I want you to tell her that you're there to help bring her and her fool of a boyfriend together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With any luck, she'll fall for the bait and start screeching away.</p>

          <p>But... but is this immortal here to hinder, or to help? Though your kind, which are not kind but most verily cruel, break wings and shatter beaks, your form appears at ease, and your weapon sheathed. I am perplexed!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did chance bring you here, or something else?</p>

          <p>Time will measure the truth in your words, stranger. But suspicion is not a failing I can suffer now, for a Strigik can love but once, and love's call cannot be ignored.</p>

          <p>Through interrogation, Molius learnt of an interesting situation developing in the powerful Urugugu Tribe. Two children of the tribe's most powerful families, who openly hated each other, had fallen in love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Molius saw an opportunity to end the tribe for good, and sent you to Owllaet, the love-struck daughter of one of the families. You promised her your help, which she readily accepted.</p>
