		<p>And a glorious day to you, [%userclass]. Did you bring coins? Mithril coins? I only ask because I seem to be getting a lot of customers showing up with silver...and I only take Mithril.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>And another thing! I only work with Clerics and Chanters. So think carefully before asking me for a reward.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Still here? All right, what can I help you find...weapons, armor, pauldrons?</p>

		<p>Did you say 1200 Mithril coins? Hmmm...I can let you have a nice armor-plated jacket for 1200.</p>

		<p>These will serve you well on the battlefield, this much I can say for sure. They're light, they're strong...and for only 900 Mithril coins, you won't find a better deal, even from a Shugo!</p>
