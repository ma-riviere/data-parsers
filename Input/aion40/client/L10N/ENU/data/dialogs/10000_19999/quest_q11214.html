          <p>This is no time for sightseeing, [%username]! Are you aware we lost the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You realize its importance, don't you? It means the Altar of Avarice is no longer safe! And if the Altar of Avarice is no longer safe, then the Inggison Illusion Fortress is not safe!</p>

          <p>I have soldiers positioned in the outpost, but that won't hold them back for long....</p>

          <p>That's the first bit of good news I've heard all day. We must reclaim the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A], and you're going to lead us to victory!</p>

          <p>[%username], I need you to get rid of the guards at the Temple. Gather some soldiers that you trust and head out as soon as you can!</p>

          <p>This isn't an elaborate mission, [%username].... It's a simple slice-and-dice job! We just need to cause chaos amongst their troops...the rest will fall into place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return to the Temple of Scales and attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_11214all]. If it gets too hairy out there, retreat.</p>

          <p>If you can get rid of enough guards, the Wisplight Legion will be dispatched to take care of the rest. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Queesia] will have a reward for you if you can pull this off.</p>
