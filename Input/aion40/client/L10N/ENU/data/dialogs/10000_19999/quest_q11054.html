          <p>Sanctum just released information about a long-cold search-and-rescue mission for a Daeva named Paris.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From what I heard, Empyrean Lady Yustiel had great expectations...but he gave up on being a Guardian in favor of armor crafting in Inggison.</p>

          <p>What do you think? Honestly. Rumor has it they were "special friends."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Paris supposedly vanished in Inggison, but not before he'd crafted a suit of legendary armor.</p>

          <p>But this Inggison armor isn't ordinary armor. Touched by Empyrean Lady Yustiel, it holds special powers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a few pieces of the armor and recently heard from a committee of Guardians that I should give pieces of the armor to Daevas who carry out important missions.</p>

          <p>Great! Go to Hanarkand and get Outer Scales from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanFi_noble_55_Ae]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanAs_noble_55_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanRa_noble_55_Ae]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanWi_noble_55_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanPr_noble_55_Ae]es.</p>

          <p>I'll only give you the Inggison leg armor if you bring enough of the scales.</p>

          <p>She had a piece of this armor and offered it to you in exchange for some Balic Outer Scales and Kinah. Well, she really meant she'd give you the armor once she'd finished her experiments, and that you'd have to stick with her until then.</p>
