          <p>It's been hard going, but I think I've restored enough of the audio.</p>

          <p>As we suspected, Surama lists what he did with the broken pieces of Tiamat's Power.</p>

          <p>Centurion Tillen's message to me said that we need to gather those pieces together. Who knows what power this blade still holds?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So really, the information I've gathered from the journal is need-to-know. Do you need to know?</p>

          <p>Thought so. Surama embedded the first piece within [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_01_BionicCPU_53_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He gave two others to [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_02_DrakanRa_Named_54_Ah] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_03_DrakanNamed_55_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_03_DrakanNamedFail_55_Ah] kept the last for himself. You know what to do now. Return here when you're done.</p>

          <p>Well, there are plenty of other pressing tasks to do. But I can't let this lie fallow for too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tillen fears what could happen if Surama ever changed his mind about Tiamat's Power or tapped its might some other way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll give this task to someone else if you don't want it. Let me know as soon as possible if you change your mind.</p>

          <p>I'm not fully confident in my reconstruction of Surama's journal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Balaur technology is difficult enough to work with. Having to deal with their language as well....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I have to admit this is partly professional curiosity. What did you find?</p>

          <p>Hmmm.... Was I mistaken...? No, I can't think that way. This is the only lead we have to go on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, I'm fairly confident [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_01_BionicCPU_53_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_02_DrakanRa_Named_54_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_03_DrakanNamed_55_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_03_DrakanNamedFail_55_Ah] have the Broken Blade Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mostly confident, anyway. Confident enough to send you back out and make sure you didn't miss them.</p>

          <p>Incredible.... I can feel the fragments from here. To think they were once together....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We always talk about Tiamat as the least of the Dragon Lords, but even he wields incredible power. We must remember that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, Tillen's already sent me another directive. I know I have it around here somewhere....</p>
