          <p>Careful! An Air Line is a very delicate machine. You must treat her gently.</p>

          <p>It takes constant maintenance to keep these babies functioning right. One malfunction, and pffft! You drop like a rock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're beautiful machines. It's a pity they're such Aether Porguses. I'd love to find an alternate fuel option, but I don't really think we'll find one.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's a problem. I'd be sad to see these babies retired, but we can't afford to waste the Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lausus is off conducting field research on an alternative transportation method, which we're pretty excited about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd be out there with him, if these Air Lines didn't need to be coddled.</p>

          <p>There's a region in Inggison known for its massively strong winds. They blow so hard you can actually see them whipping around the sky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's got something to do with anomalies in those fissures that Tiamat caused. You know how Aether energy sometimes jets from holes in the ground? We think it's a similar phenomenon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you jump into one of these Windstreams, it effortlessly carries you along, but we have no idea where they go. That's what Lausus is investigating. Could you go talk to him and find out how the Windstream mapping is going?</p>

          <p>These Windstreams have great potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once we figure out where they all go, and how to safely use 'em, they could save us both time and Aether resources.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that, my friend, would be a great strategic advantage. Off with you now. Go find out how [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lausus] is getting along.</p>

          <p>Haha! Couldn't wait, could he! He didn't believe me when I first told him about the Windstreams. Now he's dying to get out here and have a go at it, but he's stuck back at base on repair duty. Ha!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Poor guy. Nah! Not really. He loves those machines. He'll be fine. If I can just find the purple ink...ah! There it is. Let me add this latest section.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There! Take this back to Laokon...careful, it's still wet. I've only mapped two Windstreams right now, but I'm sure I'll find more. It's all in the report.</p>

          <p>Hmm...colorful. Good detail. But this section over here looks like a duplicate of that one over there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope he didn't get turned around while mapping. He tends to get a little...unfocused at times. I'll have to get someone to double-check this, but it's a great start, and the report looks quite detailed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The faster we find and map all of the Windstreams, the sooner we can cut back on the Aether use and give my devices a rest. Thanks for hoofing it over there. Let me reward you for your efforts.</p>
