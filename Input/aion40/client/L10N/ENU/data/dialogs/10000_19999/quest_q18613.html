          <p>Just a shame to let Kromede's Tear go to waste, [%username]. Kromede would probably shed tears all over again just seeing you carrying it around like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you melt it down and refine it with the Greatsword of the Judge, it'll greatly increase its killing power!</p>

          <p>Well, you'll need three things: Kromede's Tear, the Greatsword of the Judge, and a very talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first thing and, now that you found me, you have the third thing. You just need the greatsword. If you can get that, I'll take care of the rest.</p>

          <p>I truly am one of the finest blacksmiths in all Elysea. So good, in fact, that I can tell you where you can find the greatsword you'll need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae], at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. It's yours for the taking.</p>

          <p>If the Governor of Sanctum trusts me to fix his swords, then you, a simple Daeva, should trust me as well. Just come to me with Kromede's Tear and the greatsword in your Cube and I'll fix it up.</p>
