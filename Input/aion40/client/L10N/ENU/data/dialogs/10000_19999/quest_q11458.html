          <p>There are so many scholars and researchers out there who are interested in the Taloc Growth Trace. You can't throw a rock without hitting one of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to get my report documented before some other Daeva beats me to it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm just sure that my research conquests have spread from one side of this land to the other by now.</p>

          <p>I've discovered that the growth tissue of Taloc is completely different from other Elim. I've also done some guesswork about the soil of Inggison, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, well...most of it's all up here in my head. I need to get it on paper before I can submit the whole report. But I need to get what I've written thus far to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You said you were headed there soon, right? To Sanctum? Could you take the first chapter of my report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fasimedes]?</p>

          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. So, you've brought the research report from Adias?</p>

          <p>Excellent. I was curious about his findings.</p>

          <p>Hmm, I should have figured as much. Taloc has undergone massive mutation in a short span of time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very interesting. But I must know now what caused this mutation...the Aether there, or perhaps some other reason? The Balaur?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Adias] to keep working on his report. Tell him I am very pleased with what he's done so far.</p>
