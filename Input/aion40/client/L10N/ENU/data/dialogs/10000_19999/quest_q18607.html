          <p>I spoke with Brigade General Perento, and he told me that you entered Kromede's Trial...that you transcended realities to enter this place.</p>

          <p>Ha! I hoped you would say that! A potent dream like this one...now I can finally get those Dream Fragments!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sorry...sorry. I'm too excited, but for good cause. I've been trying to get these Dream Fragments for so long! It's a legendary material for us crafting masters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its properties can change shape to make almost anything. It is said that these fragments disappeared once Aion disappeared from sight. These creatures you saw...they may have these Dream Fragments.</p>

          <p>Faith and arms, that's great to hear! But let me be clear, [%username]. You must find the guards and watchers at the mansion. Only then will you find the fragments.</p>
