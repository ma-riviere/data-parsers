          <p>Observing living Drakan society in Hanarkand makes for greater understanding of our enemies and ourselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We see now that Drakan wear very different costumes based on their societal roles. In residential Hanarkand, there are two distinct groups: regular residents and priests.</p>

          <p>Did you know that Drakan are very religious? That's how it looks, at least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though the Balaur Lords are worshiped like gods, we've found altars that pre-date their arrival. Clearly, the Balaur are a spiritual people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Balaur worship differs significantly from ours, however. For instance, I belong to the Temple of Fear but can follow any Empyrean Lord I wish, even Lord Vaizel. But each Dragon Lord has its own territory where worshiping that lord, and only that lord, is mandatory.</p>

          <p>Exactly, and the Balaur traditionally carry symbols of the lord they follow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How much have these symbols changed over time? I'd like to discover the variation and evolution of their symbols by studying a current token of Tiamat and contrasting it against an older one.</p>

          <p>Priestly Drakan in both the Aetheric Field and the Abyss carry engraved staffs, so it's likely that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanPr_vil_55_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_DrakanPr_noble_55_Ae]s have the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11218a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11218b]s.</p>

          <p>Drakan are smart but hold to a more formalistic sense of logic than we do. Strength to defeat their enemies is their highest virtue.</p>

          <p>As long as Tiamat can show that he's stronger than all comers, he'll be revered in Hanarkand.</p>
