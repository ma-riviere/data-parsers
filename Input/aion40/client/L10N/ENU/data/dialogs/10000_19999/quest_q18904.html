          <p>Infiltration agents take grueling qualification tests, but I was exempt. On account of my amazing scouting abilities, you see. At least, they're amazing on paper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But... really... that is, I'm no good in a fight. I'll be mercilessly butchered the moment I start to fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
	<p>But I don't want to quit and get a reprimand. Will you get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q18904a] for me, please? Out of the goodness of your heart?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah! Karuti! Report the result to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Karuti], and she'll reward you. No doubt about it!</p>

          <p>Wait. What? APSILON told you to come see me?</p>

          <p>Yes, I know him. He borrowed some things from me and never gave them back. "What things?" isn't important.</p>

          <p>Ah well. It's not your fault he's a mooch. Here, have a reward.</p>

	<p>Apsilon didn't want to quit his job just because of poor combat skills. For the reward he promised, you killed Drakan Officers for him.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Then you went to pick up that reward from Karuti... who had no idea Apsilon intended to transfer reward-duty to her.</p>
