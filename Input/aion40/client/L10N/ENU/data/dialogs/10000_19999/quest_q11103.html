          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. Not much happening. Just standing here, watching things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I seem to be doing that quite a bit these days...just watching things. Ever since I ascended.</p>

          <p>I haven't felt well in a long while, Daeva. I just...stand here, watching life pass me by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's a long life being a Daeva. Long time to stand around and watch life saunter by you...always knowing you'll have another day to accomplish what you should have done today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be honest, I only felt truly alive before I became eternal. I really tasted all that life had to offer when...when it was still finite...when I could lose it at any time.</p>
