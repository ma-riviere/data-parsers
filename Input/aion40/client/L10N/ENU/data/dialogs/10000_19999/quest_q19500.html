          <p>Boreas and Macus spoke very highly of you, [%username]. You have quite the reputation in Sanctum already. They say your skills are an asset to our forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the war with the Balaur Lords is a trial for every Daeva in Sanctum. You must remain pure, as you were in the beginning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's our best weapon against the wicked Balaur...purity.</p>

          <p>When we fought the Abyss War, I think people forgot that our real enemy is the Balaur. We focused on the Asmodians and trained ourselves for that sort of combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that has changed with Empyrean Lord Kaisinel, and we, the followers of Ariel, need to become stronger to fight without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the glory of the Empyrean Lords, I am training students at four Temples in glorious Sanctum. How about you? Care to learn the teachings of the Temple of Justice and gain new strength in battle?</p>

          <p>The Temples offer variety...combat diversification, to coin a term. We train in the ways of Greater Stigma, a need we realized while fighting in Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't simply bestow Greater Stigma to every Daeva. You have to prove you are capable of wielding their power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Templar, you can use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ, right? Well, you must use this skill 10 times to prove that you are ready.</p>
