          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Do you have plans for that Kromede's Flame you hold? Might put a smile on a Shugo's face, but that's about all you can do with it right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then again, if you let me melt it down, I can compound it with the Tome of the Judge to make one very potent book of spells for you.</p>

          <p>Well, you'll need three items, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third and final item you'll need is the Tome of the Judge. If you can get that Tome, then I can enhance it for you.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can bring me the Tome of the Judge from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae, I'll take care of the rest.</p>
