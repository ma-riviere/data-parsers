          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Of course I have time to talk to you about pets. I always have time to talk pets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's start with the basics. First, pay attention to your pet. That's easy to remember when they're happy and acting all cute and sassy, but a bit more challenging when they're sulking or grumpy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, it's important to reach out to your pet frequently, let it tell you how it's feeling...and don't forget to respond. If you initiate communication, you need to quickly follow through. Snuggle your pet, scratch its tummy, groom it, take it for a walk in the park. If you don't close that communication loop, you'll hurt its feelings.</p>

          <p>Now, pet snuggling is a no-brainer, but pet grooming, that requires more skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, check out this book, it's all about proper pet grooming techniques. It's a bit weighty, but I think you'll find it to be a great resource.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give it a read, and if you have more questions, I'm always available.</p>
