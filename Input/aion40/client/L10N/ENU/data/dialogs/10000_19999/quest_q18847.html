          <p>Arieluma! You must be new here. Let me be the first to welcome you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Home Security officers are duty-bound to make sure your Studio is safe and secure! Better safe than sorry, after all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say, our higher-ups have us give out gifts for fresh faces like yourself--a sort of housewarming present. Interested?</p>

          <p>I'm not just a security officer, you know--I actually live in a house not far from here. It's one of the perks of the job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since I discovered the joys of home ownership, I've become a bit of a collector of furnishings and such.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I enjoy giving out these gifts so much! Would you care to take a look?</p>

          <p>Well, we Home Security officers are ever vigilant. Come back anytime if you change your mind.</p>

          <p>I know home furnishings aren't the most glamorous thing in the world. But what else reflects a personality so well?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taste is highly subjective, after all. One's home says a lot about the person who lives there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I'm glad you've decided to accept the gift. I'm interested in seeing what your choice says about you.</p>

          <p>Excellent! Please, take whatever you like. I'm partial to particular designs myself, but pick whatever suits you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope this serves as sufficient welcome. Please know that Home Security will always watch out for you and your property.</p>
