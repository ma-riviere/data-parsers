          <p>Only a few Daevas can handle a Piece of Aegis. If you take it and your Laestrygos's Sword to Anusis, he can combine them into a powerful weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of this string-toy stuff, as though you're going to dangle it in front of your playful kitter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And don't forget to bring at least 8,000,000 Kinah. This is delicate, specialized work!</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis] works out of Artisans Hall in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He and I used to work together, you know. Oh, yes. We were very close. Always together, always excited about something. My best and most creative work got done in those days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he gets impatient. Some Daevas see that as arrogance, but I promise you his attitude stems from his genius. He's impatient only because he is already so far ahead of you. Even if you don't like the way he talks, you will receive an amazing weapon.</p>

          <p>What? Foolish [%username]! Why wouldn't you use a Piece of Aegis?</p>

          <p>It will be worthless if you don't use it, just a bauble rather than a major enhancement to your power!</p>

          <p>Let me see. Laestrygos's Sword...a Piece of Aegis.... That'll come out to 8,000,000 Kinah up front. And if you think that's too expensive, good luck finding someone cheaper who won't break this gorgeous sword.</p>
