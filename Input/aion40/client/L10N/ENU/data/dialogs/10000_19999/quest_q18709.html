          <p>To have been Drakan, lord of all Atreia, and hence reduced to this paltry Sapien form for eternity... 'Tis dishonor, troth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only be glad that mine subordinates cannot see me so laid low... like [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ulaguru]. That good comrade fought beside me in the bloody fields of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, a fine warrior, Ulaguru.... A tempest of death battering at his foe alike the angry sea doth fall upon a galleon's beak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do wonder if he lives anon. If thou hast pity for my plight, tell him his old general remembers him at least.</p>

          <p>The Krall aren't animals, you know. They have pride too. Remembering his glory days, before I captured him, must've been too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it would've been better if he was an animal. Then he might not be in pain now. I'm not sure what I can do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least knowing something about Ulaguru's past will help me understand him better. Please take this with my thanks.</p>

          <p>Maduka, a ghost in Raksang, mentioned a Krall who served with him well in his living years. He had a familiar name: Ulaguru.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You sought Ulaguru out in Sanctum, and passed on Maduka's message. The Krall responded by sinking into depression.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you told Mameia about this, she thanked you for giving her new information on the Krall, though she worried about Ulaguru's pride.</p>
