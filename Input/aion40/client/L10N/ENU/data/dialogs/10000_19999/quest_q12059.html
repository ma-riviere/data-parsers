          <p>Those ignoramuses at Kamar! How can I get anything done with such a naive newcomer as my commander? She doesn't even know anything about the local environment or its unique perils!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I told her about the threat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Agrint_Gravity_58_An]s posed, she didn't even seem to understand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, she left them up to me, which is probably wise. I, in turn, would like to request you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Agrint_Gravity_58_An]s in conjunction with my own efforts.</p>

          <p>I tried to tell Beiko that the Moss Agrints were competing with us for Aether resources, but she seemed totally confused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How can she pretend to make informed decisions and commands without leadership and local combat experience?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I'm having to do everything important on my own! Who else can I depend on?</p>

          <p>Well, praise Siel that there's SOMEONE else around here who knows what's what!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, if only I could make those fools at Kamar see that this is too important a posting for a novice commander.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you think you could speak with them on my behalf? No, no. Never mind. Still, you've more than earned what I'm about to give you.</p>

          <p>Magnas believed that it was necessary to kill Moss Agrints to reduce competition for Aether, but felt Beiko didn't have the leadership qualities to do the job properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, at his request, you killed the Moss Agrints. Magnas was grateful, but still frustrated at Beiko's inexperience.</p>
