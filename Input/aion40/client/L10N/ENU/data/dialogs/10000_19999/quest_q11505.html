        <body>
          <p>Yet another refugee fell sick yesterday from a Poisonroot Fungie. I've told them again and again to be careful, but it's easily mistaken for Seedleaf Fungies. I can't keep an eye on everyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You could actually make yourself useful and get rid of some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Fungy_Flower_57_n]s. Just down the road east of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_01]--you can find them everywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wouldn't cross my mind to ask for a favor from an [%userrace]... but I'm just so shorthanded.</p>

          <p>Please understand. So many have made promises and not followed through. Perhaps I've judged too harshly.</p>

          <p>Or perhaps you're just the exception to the rule. Either way, thank you.</p>

          <p>According to Tymios, the extremely dangerous Poisonroot Fungie looks very similar to Seedleaf Fungies, which is edible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The refugees continued to get sick from mistaking the two. Tymios asked you to get rid of the dangerous variety to prevent even more sickness.</p>

          <p>You didn't like his attitude toward outsiders, but you tried your best to set an example and changed his opinion for the better.</p>
