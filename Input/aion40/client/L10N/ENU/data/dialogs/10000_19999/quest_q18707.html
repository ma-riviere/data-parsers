          <p>One of the most dangerous things about Raksang is the corrupt nature of the Aether there. It affects Daevas in deleterious ways, and we can't let the Balaur have any edge there. Fortunately, there's a solution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos have developed a pill that counteracts the effects of the corrupt Aether. But they need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18707A]s to make them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_02_DrakanMirrorNmd_60_Ae] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_03_DrakanFiremage_Nmd_60_Ae] have them. If you defeat them, we'll have what we need.</p>

          <p>I don't know how or why the Shugos developed those pills, but the scholars at Sanctum have tested them thoroughly. They work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, Shugos charge a lot for junk, and even more for treasure. That's why getting ingredients for "free," as it were, helps us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope our intelligence was right about the Runeseal Stones?</p>

          <p>Ah, yes.... I can feel their power. No wonder they're used in this Aether treatment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These will be sent to the Black Cloud Traders at once. The pills will go right to the Daevas who need them most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our chances of success in Raksang just went up, thanks to you.</p>

          <p>The Shugos are making a special pills that allow Daevas to resist the corrupt Aether in Raksang, but ingredients are needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Illusionmaster Sharik and The Flamelord in Raksang and collected their Runeseal Stones to give Enoa. She promised to pass on the ingredients to the Shugos for the pills.</p>
