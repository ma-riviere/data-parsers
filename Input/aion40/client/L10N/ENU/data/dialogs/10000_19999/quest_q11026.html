          <p>Well, isn't this just shinyrific, Veloso? Congratulations on finding a talking Crestlich. Too bad this discovery isn't very significant in reality.</p>

          <p>Balaurea's environment is so drastically different from any place inside the Aetheric Field that all its wildlife is completely irrelevant. No one should be bothering with this line of research.</p>

          <p>In any case, thank you for bringing this to me, [%username]. I may read it later if I need a good laugh.</p>

          <p>Veloso gave you a box containing Boco's beak and his first article on the subject, then asked you to show it first to his friend Pilomenes at the Illusion Fortress and then to deliver it to Creusa in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon receiving the box, Creusa seemed dismissive of the discovery in light of the fact that Balaurea's environment is so drastically different from Elysea's.</p>
