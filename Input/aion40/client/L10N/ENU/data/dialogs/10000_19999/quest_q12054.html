          <p>I'm supposed to brief you on the situation in Basilika Cavern, [%username]. If you've been there, you'll already know that a long tunnel runs from Blue Quartz Valley to the Gurriki Grotto.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where the tunnel passes beneath the Eye, it opens up into an enormous cavern. There are powerful Artifacts down there under heavy Balaur guard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We want to control those artifacts, but they're currently held by the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q12054all]s. Wrest them from their bloodied grasp, [%userclass].</p>

          <p>That's what I wanted to hear.</p>

          <p>Holding a dominant position over the Asmodians is vital. The more Artifacts we have, the more control we have over the battle for Tiamaranta.</p>

          <p>Good work, [%userclass]. I'll make sure my commanders know about your role in this.</p>
