          <p>You Elyos and your [%mainslotitem]s. Once, I too was a promising young legionary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd trained hard and hoped to join Siel's Spear. They were our greatest legion and fought terrible enemies in unforgiving environments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In full battle gear, they were a sight to behold.</p>

          <p>Would you like them? I can think of no one better to wear them again. Of course, I'll need you to do something for me.</p>
