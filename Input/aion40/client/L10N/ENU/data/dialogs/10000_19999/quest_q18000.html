          <p>I discovered some interesting stuff while repairing the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a secret space. Looks like it's created by the Rune Tribe. Yes. the ancient tribe who built this fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what's in there yet. Seleon is finding it out, but I'm guessing it's a bit too much for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you will be a big help for him, [%username], so can you give him a hand?</p>

          <p>I am sorry, but please hold on for a moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a bit too busy now examining the documents we took from the Beritra Intelligence Headquarters. </p>

          <p>(Folding the document) As expected, the Beritra folks also knew about the secret space of the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, they didn't just leave it there, but used it after modifying it into a lab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The internal investigation won't be easy since it's related to the Beritra Intelligence Headquarters, however I'm relieved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since such a competent person like [%username] wants to help me now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must be a good fit for Katalam based on how I've found this door, met you, [%username], and found the confidential document of the Beritra Intelligence Headquarters.</p>
