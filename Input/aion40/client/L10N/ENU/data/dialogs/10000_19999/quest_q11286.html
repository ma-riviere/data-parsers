	<p>Oh, so you do!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I'll send them off to Sanctum when I get around to it. The lesser crowns generally don't contain any useful information, but it's better to be safe than sorry, hey?</p>

	<p>Oh yes, Ancient Crowns. Not the most valuable of artifacts, but still worth examining.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you, [%username]. Our scholars in Sanctum will look these over soon.</p>

	<p>Ah ha! Greater Ancient Crowns!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These details here... and here... mean that I can grade this as greater. Our team in Sanctum should be able to get a good amount of information from the crown, information that we should be able to use to better understand our past.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you, friend. Your reward is well deserved.</p>

	<p>Major Ancient Crowns! Outstanding, [%username]!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You know, I rarely see ONE of these, never mind ten! Our researchers in Sanctum will be drooling in anticipation of studying this.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Now take your reward and go and look smug somewhere. You deserve it.</p>

		<p>There are four categories of treasures: Ancient Icons, Seals, Goblets, and Crowns. They show up our past more vividly than the most famous folktale. And do you know why? Hmm?</p>
		<p> </p>
    <p>Folktales can bend over time, changing with the passing years and ending up nothing like their original form. The four treasures, provided they are not overly damaged, stay true to their original message.</p>
			<p> </p>
    <p>And we depend on Daevas like you to be diligent and observant. Our thanks!</p>
