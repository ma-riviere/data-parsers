          <p>Commander Ancanus ordered me to get you up to speed on the situation in Tiamaranta. There's a lot going on here.</p>

          <p>You've heard already about Tiamat's avatars, the Incarnations, guarding the Hearts? Good. The more of the Hearts we occupy, the more control we have over the battle for Tiamaranta's Eye. We need to be the ones leading that charge, not the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur garrisons around Tiamaranta's Eye are exempt from Kahrun's Will, as is the Eye itself. Watch your back, or it'll end up full of Asmo daggers.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But Commander Ancanus is a stickler for detail, and I don't want to raise his ire. So I'll just keep this brief.</p>

          <p>In my view, Tiamaranta's just a big swath of ugly that we've got to race the Asmodians across to seize Siel's Relics first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's not kid ourselves. This truce? It won't hold a day past the death of Tiamat. Soon as that dragon falls, there'll be old scores that want settling. Whoever's got the relics, then... they'll come out on top.</p>

          <p>Once you're in the Balaur garrisons, you'll need to take control of the artifacts there. The artifacts affect either the Hearts, or the Balaur directly. Properly using the artifacts requires excellent judgment, good timing, and brute force. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The artifacts are the key. If we don't control them, we won't have the first shot at Tiamat, we won't control the relics, and those Asmodian furbacks will have the advantage when they turn on us. And that's unacceptable.</p>

          <p>The instructors explained that killing the Incarnations and occupying the Hearts opens the path to Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>

          <p>Elyos forces are in a race to seize control of the Hearts, then fight through the Balaur garrisons into Tiamaranta's Eye. The Asmodians cannot be allowed to reach Tiamat and Siel's Relics first.</p>
