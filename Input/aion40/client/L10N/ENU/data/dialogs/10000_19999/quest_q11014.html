          <p>I know...sorry. A Daeva shouldn't act this way. But Gasuto lost the supplies for Vaizel's Peak Encampment! Again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked me to trust him, and I did. So who's the bigger fool, right? He said a pack of Whitehawk Ettins stole the supplies from him. AGAIN!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what to do, [%username]. I need to get new supplies over to the fortress, but the only Daeva I can use is that fool Gasuto.</p>

          <p>Really? Thank you, [%username]! But they'll just blame me if I send someone other than that bumbling fool to do it.</p>

          <p>How about this.... The fool and I will deliver the supplies, and you deal with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ettin_30_An]s near the fortress.</p>

          <p>Once they're taken care of, the deliveries should be much easier for my assistant, the fool, to handle. Sound all right to you?</p>
