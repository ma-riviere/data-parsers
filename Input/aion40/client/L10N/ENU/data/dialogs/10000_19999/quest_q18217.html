          <p>One of the reasons we can't let everyone into the Crucible Coliseum at once is to make sure we don't break poor Inggril when she's trying to maintain the illusion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to make sure that only a certain number of people compete there, and that we keep track of who goes in, and when.</p>

          <p>Hence the tickets, yes. We want everyone to have a chance to compete, so we limit them to one per day.</p>

          <p>Speaking of which, I have tickets to the Arena of Chaos if you're interested.</p>
