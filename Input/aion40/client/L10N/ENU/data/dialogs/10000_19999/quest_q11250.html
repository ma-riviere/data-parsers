          <p>Good, good. You've arrived. Kaisinel's Agent Veille recommended you to me. She said she could not have turned back the dark ones without your help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So she wants me to give you an important new mission, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I say, "[%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3011_A]" and "[%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3021_A]," you can guess the mission, yes?</p>

          <p>First, let's talk rewards, yes? If you've got Laestrygos's Greatsword, I'm sure you've found it more than useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course! All Laestrygos's goods are useful. But you know who is even better? Anusis! And when you successfully complete this mission, I'll ask Anusis to replace your greatsword with an even better one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ready for action? For Veille? For Elysea? For improved weaponry?</p>

          <p>Fierce battles rage in both the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3011_A] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3021_A], and the situation can only get worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Veille believes we must reclaim those places now. You must go. Go to the Citadel and the Temple. Rid us of the vile Guardian Generals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll discuss the advanced version of Laestrygos's Greatsword when you return.</p>

          <p>Agent Veille wanted you for this mission. Yes, it is scary, but who cares? Don't you want to please the Agent?</p>
