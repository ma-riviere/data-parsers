          <p>Heard of the Wandering Ruins, [%username]? It's an ancient place, so scarred that no one has been able to accurately date it, or even ascertain who built it! My guess is that the ruins are Reian, but I need confirmation before I can send off my report to Kamar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to go there and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Gargoyle_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_SouledStone_58_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Sam_58_An]s. Collect whatever fragments you can from them, then bring them to me so I can study them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now, before the place is lost to the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Ah, you're back. Did you do as I asked?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know my request was strange coming from a simple Warehouse Keeper, but I want to help my people more directly, and this seemed like a way to do it.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Interesting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See these pieces? They're clearly wings, but without the full sculpture, I can't tell if they're Reian wings. And these pieces here all seem to follow Reian architectural philosophies, but again... I cannot confirm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems I will need more help in this matter. Still, thank you for your time. Here's your payment.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the relics gave no information, leaving Iali sorely disappointed.</p>
