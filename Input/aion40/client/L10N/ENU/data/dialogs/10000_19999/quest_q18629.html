          <p>Pardon me, [%username], but what are you going to do with that Kromede's Flame you have? It's not worth a shard pile to a Shugo trader, that much I can tell you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you melt it down, you can compound it with the Warhammer of the Judge to make one very strong weapon.</p>

          <p>It requires three items, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third--and final--item is the Warhammer of the Judge. If you can get that to me, then I'll refine it for you.</p>

          <p>Consider yourself blessed by Ariel, [%username]. I normally wouldn't dirty my apron with an unpaid project like this...but I'm making amends for beating a Shugo nearly to death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to my beliefs, absolution requires sacrifice. And since you're the first Daeva I happened upon, the honor of my uncompensated help falls to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Fire Temple in Asmodae. There you'll find the Warhammer of the Judge with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae]. Get that, and I'll do the rest.</p>

          <p>I practically invented the art of blacksmithing, but you're going to stand there and tell me you have reservations?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't embarass either of us any longer. Just come to me with the Warhammer of the Judge and Kromede's Flame in your Cube, and I'll show you why I'm considered a legend.</p>
