          <p>Gestanerk never expected to be in so deep, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I took Hamerun's offer...for the Kinah. I thought, make a little Kinah, get out in a few months. But Gestanerk got in real deep, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hamerun is the big boss! Practically forced Gestanerk to work for him! Daeva wants Hamerun.</p>

          <p>Sing? Oh, talk. Why doesn't Daeva just say "talk" when Daeva means talk, nyerk? All right, Gestanerk sing now....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hamerun is a big, powerful, evil Asmodian Daeva. He learned that Gestanerk can make Sapiens follow orders, so he paid big Kinah to help him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hamerun growed too greedy for his own good, nyerk. Hamerun wants to open dirty goods facilities everywhere. And he hits Gestanerk.</p>
