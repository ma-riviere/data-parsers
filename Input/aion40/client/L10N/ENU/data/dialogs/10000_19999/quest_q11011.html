          <p>By all that's light, why in the shadows won't this wound heal?! Oh, hi. You're still here? These wounds are odd. I thought they'd heal with the new treatment, but they haven't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It helped stop the oozing, but they still won't heal. I don't know what that dredgion weapon is, but it's sure done a number on these soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got to get these guys back on their feet quickly. The dredgion is not going to stay away long. At this point, I'd swap my left arm for some Root Herb from the Holy Tree....</p>

          <p>Oh, it's just a legend from the early years of the Abyss war. Back before we had Obelisks, when the chances of dying in battle were high.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The legend tells of a Daeva of Nursing named Gayla who used Root Herb to save huge numbers of Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, the holy energy of the Root Herb reverses the effects of the Balaur's poisons. If such a thing actually exists, we could sure use some now!</p>

          <p>The legend says that it's found among the roots of the Holy Trees. Those are tricky to find now days, especially in Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though...the drunks at the fortress tavern are always going on about some enormous Holy Tree in Inggison called Taloc. It's supposed to be even bigger and stronger than the Elim inside the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's just a legend, but do you think it's worth checking into? If it is true, [%username], would you humor me and go to Taloc's Forest to look for Root Herb?</p>

          <p>If Root Herbs exist anywhere, I'm sure you'll find them by Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! I almost forgot, the story says that you have to prepare a special bandage made of Fess Textile cloth to use with the Root Herb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have no idea why...but that's how the story goes. If you bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Root_from_Herb] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_TA_PART_CLOTH2_03A], we'll give it a shot.</p>

          <p>I understand. It is rather an odd long shot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I can find some time, perhaps I'll go myself. It would be interesting to see if the legend is true or not.</p>

          <p> </p>

          <p>My Aion, how lucky are we that the legend was true, and that there just happens to be a Holy Tree in our neighborhood?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Taloc's Forest, found the Root Herb, and brought it back to Naiting, along with some Fess textile. She thanked you and ran off to prepare the legendary concoction.</p>
