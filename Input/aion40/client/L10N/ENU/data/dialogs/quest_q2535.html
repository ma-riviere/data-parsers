          <p>You may not know this, but I grew up in Besfer Village. When my father ascended as a Daeva, my family moved to Pandaemonium, but I remembered all my friends in Besfer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently I had to visit the village for a mission, and I got a terrible shock. Two of my childhood friends have become zombies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My best friends, Imud and Moloch.</p>

          <p>I'd heard that Imud became a Priest and Moloch became a Watch Leader, so I went to the Besfer Refugee Camp and asked around about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone says they fought bravely trying to save others, and were taken by the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gigrite told me that real friendship means sending them back to the flow of Aether, but...I don't think I can kill my friends. [%username], will you help me? </p>
