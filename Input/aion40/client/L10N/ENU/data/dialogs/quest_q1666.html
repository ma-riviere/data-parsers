          <p>The mood in Heiron was always grim, but the Balaur invasion's turned it nigh apocalyptic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An Abyss Gate! We thought it'd never happen again, and yet...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, no point in wallowing. We must take the fight to the Balaur--but it isn't easy. There are so few Guardians and so many Balaur. We can't do much more than defend, but that just gives them more time to amass their forces.</p>

          <p>You went to the Indratu Barracks and slaughtered many Balaur. Hopefully, they'll regret messing with the Elyos!</p>
