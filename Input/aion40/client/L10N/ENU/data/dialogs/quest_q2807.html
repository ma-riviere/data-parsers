          <p>Really? Are you good enough to retake Asteria Fortress for us?</p>

          <p>You know how it goes: not enough men, no reinforcements, you freelance Daevas are all we've got.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we have been planning strategies to get the fortress back, but the problem is always the number of troops.</p>

          <p>Good, maybe you've got an idea what our plan is.</p>

          <p>We're going to hit them in several places at once, split up their troops so they'll be easier to deal with.</p>

          <p>All right, here's your part of the plan: you're going to get rid of their weapons. They're not going to fight without weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me put it more concretely: destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2807_all], and bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2807a] to me.</p>
