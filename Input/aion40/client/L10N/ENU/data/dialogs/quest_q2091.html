          <p>Welcome, [%username]. Thank you for coming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't get a lot of visitors out here anymore. Even veteran warriors are scared of the contamination. Can't say I blame them. Who wants to train for years to be the best with a sword, only to be killed by the air you breathe or the water you drink?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole situation here is shameful. Brusthonin used to be a breadbasket for our people. If we could revive it, all of Asmodae would benefit. The few who choose to serve here are dedicated to that goal.</p>

          <p>Noble perhaps, but sometimes overwhelming. We have so much to do, but lack for strong backs and skilled hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at me--I'm supposed to be retired already, but here I am. That's why I'm so glad to see you. Someone with your skills, who others look up to...perhaps more will follow your example.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're ready to get to work, I'll tell you more about the Red Sky Legion who protected Brusthonin before the Cataclysm, and Old Nahor Castle on Nahor Lake.</p>
