         <p>I'm so grateful, [%username]. You saved the most important work of my life and retrieved enough material so I can reestablish my laboratory!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> With a little spit and polish this cabin could serve as a temporary lab, at least until I can find new quarters.</p>
