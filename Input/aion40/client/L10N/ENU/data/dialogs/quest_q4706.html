          <p>Does the nice Daeva see that Artifact there?</p>

          <p>Daeva might be thinking it looks normal, but it was abandoned and broken for years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Suirunerk found it, and fixed it up when there were no scary Balaur around, akakakak.</p>

          <p>Thank you, kind Daeva, but that's not even the best part, nyerk. It is special, even for an Artifact!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Suirunerk doesn't tell everyone this, no, but... it takes you to Dingy Poeta... or was it Dark Poeta? Either way, lots of things there, nyerk nyerk. Valuable things, they say..</p>
