          <p>Brigade General Perento turned down my request for reinforcements. He says he barely has enough soldiers to hold the Fortress against the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that won't matter if the Balaur show up to invade and the whole Fortress is full of Klaws. I know how to defeat them, but we need more soldiers. No one could possibly do it alone.</p>

        	<p>Some time ago I made a contingency plan. I didn't think we'd ever need it, but the Klaws are more dangerous than I ever predicted. It might be our only hope now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone has to get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2Named_39_Ae]. Klaws live in a hierarchical society. If their king dies, the workers won't gather food, the soldiers won't know who to attack. Total collapse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But King Klawtan is incredibly hard to kill. That's why we need help.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure it's a good idea for you to go alone. Even with all the stories I've heard about you, it might still be a good idea for you to have some friends help you take on [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2Named_39_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're successful, then bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1549a]s for study. I mean, if you're going to kill him, we shouldn't waste the chance to advance science.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>King Klawtan will be in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_018]. The place is swarming with Klaws and they'll fight to defend it. Good luck.</p>
