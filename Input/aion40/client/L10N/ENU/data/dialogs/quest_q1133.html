          <p>A Guardian's work is never done, you know. We provide the most vigilant defense against all enemies of Elysea. We rein in the Krall and keep a steady eye on the Abyss Fragments above us. </p>         
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's more to it, though. Every day well-being does not rest on the greater tasks, but rather the smaller ones--the jobs deemed inconsequential by many Guardians.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am not among their number. The morale of our people is the bond that strengthens our armies and I tend to its fractures whenever I can, no matter how small. That is a Daeva's responsibility, after all.</p>

          <p>Drasia contacted me recently--it seems that Lobnites are eating the Inina around the citadel. She hasn't been able to catch any Inina for days and it's affecting her cooking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Normally, I'd handle this myself, but I've just been issued orders from the Brigade General himself. I can hardly go and tell him I'm too busy, so would you go out and hunt some [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA16_2]s for me? Remember, addressing small problems can stop them from becoming bigger ones.</p>

          <p>You see the wisdom in what I have said, then! Excellent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to hunt eleven [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA16_2]s. They may look docile enough, but they can turn on you in an instant. Don't try to take on eleven at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a shame to have to cut their numbers, but it won't do to lose the Inina.</p>
