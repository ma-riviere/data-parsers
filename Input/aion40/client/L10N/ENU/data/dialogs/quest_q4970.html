          <p>Daeva have moment?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to ask Daeva's help with an important matter. I have message for Marra and Daskin at the Fine Boutique, but can't deliver it, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Message is nothing complicated. I should have contacted much sooner, but auction at the fortress has had me chasing own tail, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Impatient Daeva! Micrinrinerk is getting there! Truth is, fine costume materials far more expensive than Daeva thinks, nyerk. Pandaemonium subsidizes the costs a little bit, then Shugo Traders act as the middleman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But budget is limited, so I let Marra and Daskin come to pick best materials for themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just tell them goods have arrived, and for them to come and choose. They will get picture, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Daeva should go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mione] first, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She sent package of yummy snacks so I would tell her of new shipments before others. Micrinrinerk doesn't know why Marra has to be first to know, but has to repay debt for yummy snacks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then after her, visit Daskin. Be quick Daeva, and perhaps Marra send more yummy snacks, nyerk! </p>
