          <p>If there were an award for hunting Calydons, I'd have it! Of course I hate to brag about my prowess as an archer, but if not for me this whole area would be overrun by them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hunt them day and night, but their numbers never seem to decrease. I appreciate having so many targets for my arrows, but it's getting old.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're just so tenacious! Why do they keep coming back for more?</p>

        <p>It's true. They usually do manage to get away with a coin-purse or some valuables.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reports of their robberies are becoming more frequent, in spite of my efforts.</p>

          <p>Actually, if you're available I'd like to hire you. This is a Bounty Hunter camp. When people kill stuff around here they get paid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know the Calydons pretty well now, and if we don't give them a bloody nose, they'll never back off. They're enjoying these successes too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Trust me, friend. Fighting [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAssassin_47_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonMage_47_An]s is profitable, and good practice.</p>

          <p>Calydons are entertaining to kill as well. They make the most amusing noises!</p>

          <p>They're not always easy to dispatch though. I know I joke around a bit, but don't get overconfident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now hunt 30 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAssassin_47_An]s and 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonMage_47_An]s. I'll be waiting for you.</p>
