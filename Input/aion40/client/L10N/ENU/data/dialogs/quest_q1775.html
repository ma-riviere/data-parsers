          <p>Legends say that the ancient people of Atreia had many wonderful powers, including the miraculous ability to grant life to stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The proof is right here in the Ruins of Roah. It is a truly astounding sight!</p>

          <p>And the most astonishing sight of all? That colossal structure in the middle of Krotan Rock--a massive, ancient weapon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But not all of Roah lies dead. The Garcikhans, those artificial creatures, still move.</p>

          <p>Yes, a big problem. If Garcikhans can create more Garcikhans, then soon the whole Ruins will be overrun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are not a danger in small numbers, though, and culling their ranks from time to time will keep their population in check.</p>
