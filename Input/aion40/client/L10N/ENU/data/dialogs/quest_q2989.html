          <p>Many people seek the Wise to find great power. No matter how long they look, they won't find what they do not already possess.</p>

          <p>I can feel great power within you. Yet hesitation clouds your mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is the next battle the most important thing? The next mission? Or your responsibility as a Daeva? Is it right to sacrifice enemies for the justice of Asmodae? Is it worthwhile to live an endless life?</p>

          <p>[%username], when you find your true faith, the hesitation will vanish. Make a clear judgment, and accept the path before you.</p>
