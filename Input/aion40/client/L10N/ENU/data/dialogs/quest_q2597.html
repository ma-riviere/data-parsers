          <p>Humans lived on their own long before Daevas came along. We were much weaker than Balaur, but we held our own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Things are different now. We've forgotten how to fight for ourselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I kept insisting that we shouldn't rely solely on Daevas, but no one listened. Now we're homeless, freezing, and afraid.</p>

          <p>The Watch is getting stronger, but we need better armor. A Daeva doesn't really die, but we do!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better protection for our warriors would make a stronger community for us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I’m planning to craft armor from solid, rugged materials for our Watch members. </p>

          <p>Hard carapace would be a good armor material... The problem is Alukina's Palace is the only place I know to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, rather, for you to get it. Humans can't go there.</p>

          <p>Would you help me collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2597a]s so that I can craft new armor for the Watch?</p>

          <p>I really appreciate this. I'm going to need the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2597a]s of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_PotcrabD_44_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LobniteWaterPlantD_44_Ae]s for the armor.</p>

          <p>You know if I could get inside the palace myself, I would.</p>
