          <p>Oh my! I requested these weeks ago! I had just about given up hope of ever receiving them! I wonder what happened. It may not be gourmet, but at least two more Legions will eat tonight.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%userclass]. You've done a great service to all Elyos Daevas today.</p>

          <p>You took it to Cymaon, a quartermaster stationed at Teminon Landing. He was grateful for the delivery, saying that his supplies were almost exhausted.</p>
