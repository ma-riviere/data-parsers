          <p>When I first became a Guardian, I had this great buddy, Zinas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We did everything together. Guard duty, volunteer work, double-dating, you name it. Those were the days!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he got reassigned to Agairon Village, and I was assigned here. Don't get me wrong, this is a prime assignment, but I miss hanging out with Zinas.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we had a lot of laughs.... Say, you wouldn't by chance be planning to pass by [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G3_SUB_1] anytime soon, would you?</p>

          <p>Sweet! Thanks, [%username]. It's not every Daeva you can ask to run a personal errand for you. I appreciate it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zinas] to come on up to the fortress whenever he can find the time. If he can't find me, have him ask Pallas where I am. He always knows where everyone is.</p>

          <p>Dalanius! He's the only one who never gave a rip if I ascended or not. What a blast we had in basic training!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's offering to pay for dinner? That's a new one. Back in our heyday, he was always totally broke. Spent everything on pets and armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he's buying, I can't miss it! If I can clear all of my tasks for the day, I'll head up there this evening and surprise him.</p>
