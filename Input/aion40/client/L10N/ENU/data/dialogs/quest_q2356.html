          <p>Everyone's on edge these days! As bad as with that rumor that Elyos spies had followed Deltras here. Oh, that was awful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It spread like a fever. Locals, people born here, were accused, tortured, then found to be innocent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was no basis for it, yet we turned on each other. I fear what will happen now, when there's a real threat!</p>
