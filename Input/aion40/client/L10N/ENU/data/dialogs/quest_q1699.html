          <p>Thanks for your help removing the stench so far, but there's more do be done for Jeiaparan Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, radiant [%username], we need your strong powers to aid us in the Black Tears Swamp where we can erase the foul odor for good. Yes, we must fly all the way to the southern road of the Decayed Grove.</p>

          <p>That depends on your definition of natural, I guess. The Contaminated Spirits stink to the tip of Aion's Tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Made from contaminated soil and dessicated stones, their noisome scent runs thick with age and decay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you say, bright one? Does your courage extend to this?</p>

          <p>Aion be praised. I feared you'd turn me down.</p>

          <p>Please, get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_34_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_35_An]s on the Decayed Grove's southern road.</p>

          <p>Incessant battles exhaust our soldiers, and morale is in the bottom of the latrine...which surely smells better than the general outdoors. We're counting on your skill and cunning, [%username].</p>

          <p>You'd think Sanctum would spend some of its budget on morale out here. I heard there was a Lighterica concert in Eltnen the other day, but what of our dampened spirits?</p>
