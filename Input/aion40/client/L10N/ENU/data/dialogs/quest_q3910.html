          <p>Hygea's task was actually a test. We sought one who was neither a Cleric nor Chanter who could carry out the teachings of Life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lady Yustiel charged us to spread the teachings of Life and render aid to all in need. That task has grown more difficult lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Constant warfare with the Asmodians and Balaur stretches our ranks perilously thin. The need for our gifts is all too great.</p>

          <p>Clerics and Chanters are simply overwhelmed just healing and supporting their comrades. Thus we seek to bolster our efforts in other ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The teachings of Lady Yustiel are open to all, and you are most worthy, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reach out a helping hand to those who have fallen. Shine on them with the light of Life.</p>

          <p>It's a shame that someone like you does not follow our path. You would have made a splendid disciple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least keep a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_SOULSTONE_RESURRECT] in your cube at all times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can raise and encourage a fallen Elyos...and pass along the wisdom of carrying such stones.</p>
