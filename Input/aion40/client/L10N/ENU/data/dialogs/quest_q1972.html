          <p>Marvelous, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't been teaching you Weaponsmithing for long, but you're already very good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you have a special talent for the craft.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to test how good you are....</p>

          <p>I would like you to make Anteros' Noble Greatsword for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need more than talent to make something like that. You also need ceaseless dedication and effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, will you give it a try?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, though, if you agree to become a Weaponsmithing Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. Please think carefully before you answer.</p>

          <p>Then, make Anteros' Noble Greatsword and bring it to me.</p>

          <p>You can buy the design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nakia] over there. But I warn you, it'll take more skill to make Anteros' Noble Greatsword than it ever did to make [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1972]s.</p>

          <p>It's not easy, but hard workers like you can succeed, [%username].</p>
