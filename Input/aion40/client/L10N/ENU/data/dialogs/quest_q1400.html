          <p>I was sure they said it was a [%userclass] named [%username]. Those stories keep us going out here, you know.</p>

          <p>Most of our time is spent dealing with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Troll_35_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Trollkin_35_An]. It's harder all the time.</p>

          <p>Sometimes it takes half a day to hunt just one, and Hylas said I must account for another 20 before my shift ends. Could I trouble you for help?</p>
