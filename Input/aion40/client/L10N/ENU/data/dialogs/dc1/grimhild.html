          <p>Fate insists on telling me its secrets. Everywhere I look I see portents and omens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The signs are askew, as if your future flies with but one wing. I see your death, so close I can almost feel its breath, but...your life doesn't seem threatened. In fact, your destiny glows brightly...brightly...</p>

          <p>I mean that something, someone influences your fate.</p>

          <p>This person's birth was marked by a star of great significance. Don't ask me why, but he seems to be helping you, preserving the thread of your life.</p>

          <p>There is more...another presence, malign and foreboding. It reaches toward you, for your life...</p>

          <p>You should keep these words with you. They may prove more useful than any weapon.</p>

          <p>You'd be surprised how little I expect of you. Still, you've demonstrated an astonishing depth of ignorance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your journey to this city, your struggles, victories, and failures are all clear to me. I see you...in a dark place...a place of death, talking with an exiled Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may doubt me, but never doubt the one who helps you. Without this person, you are lost.</p>
