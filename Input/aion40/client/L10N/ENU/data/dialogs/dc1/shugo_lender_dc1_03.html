          <p>Daeva needs to be stronger? I have perfect equipment for you! Mist items are extremely strong, yet you pay so little Kinah for that power!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You cannot keep them forever, nyerk. They become just mist again after a certain time. But that time listed up front, and until then you are powerhouse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a great deal, and I know great deals! Akakakak! So why not buy?</p>
