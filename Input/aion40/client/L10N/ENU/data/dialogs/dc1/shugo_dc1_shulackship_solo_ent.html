          <p>Very exciting news, Daeva! Traders found way to take you directly to middle deck of Steel Rake!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ShulackShip_D_2F], upper and lower decks are closed off, so Daeva can enter without Group!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How do we do it? It is trade secret! So how about it? Are you up to challenge of going it alone?</p>

          <p>Hmmm, are you sure you are not in Group, Daeva? And are you sure you have been to Steel Rake before?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If answer to both questions is not definite "yes," then cannot let you in. Sorry, it is Black Cloud Traders policy, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cannot have liability issues, you know. Come back later when you are able to enter by our rules.</p>
