          <p>If you're trying to stay on the bleeding edge of fashion you better not go far from Pandaemonium, or from me. It's no secret that I've created the most celebrated fashion trends of the last decades.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anything I design is guaranteed to headline the most exclusive parties. Within weeks merchants are selling cheap imitations to the average Asmodian.</p>

          <p>I do all right, but you probably won't be surprised to find out that the ones who really make a profit are the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've realized that whatever fabrics I use for my designs will become much more popular, so they do their best to spy on me and see what my new designs will look like. Then they buy up as much fabric as they can and sell it when the price goes sky high!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I should try that myself!</p>
