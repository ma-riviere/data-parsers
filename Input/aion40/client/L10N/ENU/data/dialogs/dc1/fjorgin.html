          <p>You know it's strange...as a Soul Healer, I'm supposed to understand pains of the spirit, but I seem powerless to prevent my own heart from breaking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, there's nothing you can do either, [%userclass]. When life is an eternity, the oath "until death may part us" loses its weight, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Perin]'s fault, nor mine. Centuries change people, and love doesn't always change with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can still help others, though. Is your soul in pain?</p>
