          <p>You think clothes are just for warmth and protection? Pish. That mentality is SO last year!</p>

          <p>Look around us, [%username]. We're not eating dust and drinking from puddles anymore--we have fires and walls and masonry and FABULOUS rugs! Just look at those curtains!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course not all Daevas can pull off fancy clothes, but those who can.... We're head-turners, not neck-snappers. What do you think--are you one of us?</p>
