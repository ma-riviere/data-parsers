          <p>Cooking requires patience. If you're naturally impatient, rein it in. You can't constantly lift lids or pick off bits to taste. And feathers forbid you should burn something while in a hurry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you feel yourself getting angry or frustrated, just take a nice deep breath. Otherwise, your bad mood will taint the food you make.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just look at me! Everyone knows I'm a hellcat. Shortest fuse of anyone in Pandaemonium. I don't deny it. But while I'm cooking, I'm calm as a midnight sky.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I could use another cook. We're very short-staffed. But I've no time for flibbertigibbets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're not prepared to fill the orders I give you, then don't even bother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Consider this fair warning. You don't want to be stuck in a hot kitchen with an angry cook.</p>
