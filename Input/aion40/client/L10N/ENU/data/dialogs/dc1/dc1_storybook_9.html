          <p>Ever since we were children, we have been taught that Daevas protect us and keep us safe. We are told that ascension is the highest blessing Aion can bestow on us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We worship Daevas as glorious beings and hope one day to become Daevas ourselves.</p>

          <p>Yet as Asmodians we also know that hardship brings us strength. We prove our worth to Aion in the daily struggle for survival. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we grow complacent, we become weak.</p>

          <p>And what is ascension if not the ultimate excuse for complacency?  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas have lost nearly all fear of death. They no longer know of starvation or thirst.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They can walk unscathed through freezing cold and burning heat. Injury and disease have lost all meaning to them.</p>

          <p>They can only laugh at the troubles of Humans as they soar above the clouds, condescending to help us like an adult might help a simple child.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By accepting their help we become weak as well, trusting that whatever our problems are, some passing Daeva will solve them.</p>

          <p>One needs only look to the Vanahal District of Pandaemonium to see the ultimate effects of life as a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rather than spend their immortality in service to Aion and Asmodae, the families of Vanahal spend eternity in endless parties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet the Shedim Lords would never reprimand them, for doing so would undermine the very basis of Pandaemonium's power.</p>

          <p>Daevas may appear strong on the outside. Inside, their strength proves hollow. After centuries of easy living they become as weak and effete as any Elyos. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ascension may bring strength, but it is strength unearned. It is not the Asmodian way.</p>

          <p>We must think of Daevas not as role models to be emulated, but for what they are: the tools of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were created to fight the Balaur and the Elyos. They were not created to make our lives easier. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we Asmodians put every problem in the hands of the Daevas, we will all grow lazy and weak in the eyes of Aion.</p>
