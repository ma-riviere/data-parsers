          <p>Preface</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is the story of Impetusium, the great coliseum of the Daevas, from its construction to its fall into disuse and decay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reader, if you have seen the magnificent ruins of Impetusium and wondered what the story behind those titanic toppled columns might be, I urge you to read further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This humble work is respectfully dedicated to Shaga, and to the countless heroes of Impetusium whose names are lost to history.</p>

          <p>Chapter 1: The Rise of Sword Fighting</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not long after the Cataclysm, the Five Empyrean Lords, preoccupied with rebuilding Atreia and healing the painful legacy of the Cataclysm, decided to eliminate the remaining allies of the Balaur. Many had already been expelled from the Aetheric Field. The Black Claw Mau, however--the running dogs of the Balaur--still wielded power in Altgard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Several renowned Legions were sent to subdue the Mau tribe. They set up camp to the south of the Altgard Ice Lake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As they trained for battle with the Mau, the Legions competed among themselves to sharpen their skills and boost morale. This fraternal sparring became the foundation of Impetusium.</p>

          <p>Chapter 2: The Construction of Impetusium</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the war against the Mau ended in victory for the Asmodians, the Five Shedim Lords declared that a permanent arena should be erected upon the site where the Legions had encamped in Altgard. They believed all brave Asmodian warriors would benefit from training in dueling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Master artisans, architects, and many famous Daevas of the time participated in the work, so construction progressed rapidly. Even in ruins, the outlines of its grand and classical style are visible today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the Arena, sword fighting became very popular. Duels were fought to settle points of honor, for recreation, for cash prizes, even to settle marriage suits. Daevas came in vast numbers to duel with one another. In the larger span of Atreian history, Impetusium lasted only for a few glorious moments. In that time it produced numerous heroes.</p>

          <p>Chapter 3: Shaga, the Legend of Impetusium</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The name Shaga is instantly familiar to anyone who has studied the history of Impetusium. Shaga arrived at the Arena from nowhere and became a legendary hero.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instantly recognizable in his black helmet and black armor, a solitary red feather on his breastplate, he had no peer among Impetusium's fighters. The ringside poets said that he moved as lightly as breeze-blown apple blossom, and struck with the sudden ferocity of a summer storm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shaga's legend was not confined to the arena. A true wandering hero, he would appear whenever and wherever people needed help. He never spoke, but instead greeted people with his gentle gaze. Many women who glimpsed those mysterious eyes through his visor were smitten and fell hopelessly in love. It was not until much, much later that the most astonishing fact about Shaga was revealed. He was not a he at all, but rather a she.</p>

          <p>Chapter 4: The Glory of Old Altgard</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas still remember the days when Impetusium held sword fighting competitions. "It was not the muddy backwater it is now," they say, their eyes shining. "It was prosperous beyond imagination."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Impetusium bustled with talented Daevas, excited Humans who had come to gawk, and vendors of every kind. Each day was a holiday. Exotic food cooking in the roadside stands set people's mouths watering, and no street corner was without its huddle of beribboned supporters, talking and laughing together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, crowds caused occasional disturbances, but any quarrel or dispute was quickly settled. Unruly brawling in the street was an insult to the event, and to the noble Daevas who had worked hard to improve themselves and given so much for the contest.</p>

          <p>Chapter 5: The Decline of Impetusium</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those peaceful and festive days in which Impetusium thrived did not last long. The discovery of Elysea marked the end of peace. The Shedim Lords assigned all Asmodian Daevas to fight the Abyss War.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With Altgard no longer a main rallying point, Impetusium was closed down. Although some Daevas objected, the majority understood that the dark clouds of the War had cast a chill over the excitement of the great arena. It was no longer a time for sport but for battle.</p>

          <p>Postscript</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just as I was finishing this book, I heard good news from Pandaemonium. To commemorate the proud history of Asmodae, the Five Shedim Lords have declared that Impetusium should be restored to its former glory!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day soon, reader, the skies may once again ring with the sound of blade on blade, and we may see brave Daevas competing with one another for glory and praise, as they did in Shaga's time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May that day come soon!</p>
