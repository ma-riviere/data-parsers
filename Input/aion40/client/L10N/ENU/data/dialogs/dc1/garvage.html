          <p>By the Lords, Duna is driving me crazy! She just can't get it through her head that some art is just for fun. Blah blah, "Art has a duty to reflect serious philosophy," blah blah! My art has a duty to make people happy enough to give me a few Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In my new play, Deltras and his men sneak into a tower in Pandaemonium and take a bunch of hostages, and Lord Zikel sends a grizzled veteran Archon to take them out. Itâ€™s gonna be huge!</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure it takes a few liberties with historical events, but I'm not a historian. Can't art just be entertainment? Nobody ever threw a million Kinah at a historian!</p>
