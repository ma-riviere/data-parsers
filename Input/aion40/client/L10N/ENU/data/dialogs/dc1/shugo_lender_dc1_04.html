          <p>Like what you see, Daeva? Better grab it while you can, akakakakak.</p>

          <p>Nothing lasts forever, and that goes double for these special weapons. Solid enough while you need them, but they drift away once their time is up. Never unexpected, of course. I guarantee the time up front. No surprises.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not convinced? Walk around and compare. Go ahead. For the value, my weapons simply cannot be beat.</p>
