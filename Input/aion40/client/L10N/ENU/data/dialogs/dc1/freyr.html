          <p>A person's destiny is always in motion, especially a Daeva's. Because we live so long, the endpoint of our life is the product of an immeasurable number of decisions and events.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, even the power to see the immediate future or recent past is a major achievement, beyond the reach of most Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So how can I aid you today? I cater to the [%userclass] up to level 50; after that, you'll have to see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aranolf] at the Convent of Marchutan.</p>
