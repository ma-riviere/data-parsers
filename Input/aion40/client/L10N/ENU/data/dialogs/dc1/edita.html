           <p>Refining stones are remarkable things. So many take them for granted, yet it's not possible to make a quality piece of equipment without one.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>I've always been fascinated with the crafting process, so I truly appreciate it when a customer shows some knowledge and respect for it. That's why I began selling these in the first place.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>I hope you put my wares to good use. I sleep well knowing that I help produce the arms that glorify Asmodae.</p>
