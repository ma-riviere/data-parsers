          <p>Music expands to take up whatever space is offered, be it a tavern, concert hall, or heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not pretend to stand among the greats, but I pray to Aion every day that I can in my own poor way fill Asmodian hearts with honor and joy. Without music, life would be a mistake.</p>

          <p>Before you listen, Daeva, I have a somewhat unorthodox request of you: could you close your eyes? Block out all sight and thought except my music. See what happens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(You close your eyes and listen without preoccupation.)</p>
          <p> </p>
