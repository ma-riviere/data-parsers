          <p>I hate Guard duty. It's so boring. If I was guarding a fortress or...you know, someplace people were actually likely to attack...it could be exciting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But imagine standing guard over a craft studio. Why? What am I meant to be guarding against? Woodworm? Ravenous moths?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bored, bored, bored...bored out of my mind...</p>
