          <p>Historic documents confirm the existence of the sword known as the Edge of Sanity. We know where it was created, but not whether the rumors behind it bear truth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the rumors are given substance by the Edge of Sanity's curse, and there is a curse--that is not a rumor. This curse causes whoever wields the sword to succumb to madness. I've been told the whispers of the sword slither into the mind and nest in the subconscious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are those who desire the Edge of Sanity, and those who fear it, and it is the fear that causes most of the rumors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This book is a collection of all the stories I've heard about the sword while traveling across Asmodae. I write this  to determine which stories are true, and which are false.</p>

          <p>The Creator of the Edge of Sanity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many who doubt that the weaponsmith Agrif forged the Edge of Sanity, though he was indeed the crafter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard for people to imagine a Human creating an object of such power, and most suspect powerful outside forces were at work. One of the better known rumors stipulates that a malevolent ancient Daeva disguised as Agrif forged the sword. Another states that an Elyos Guardian created the sword and smuggled it into Reshanta where it would wreak havoc amongst the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Usener, a master weaponsmith of Pandaemonium and a former pupil of Agrif, issued a firm statement which seems to dispel the rumors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"These rumors are laughable. I swear on Azphel's wings that I watched Agrif forge the Edge of Sanity from start to finish. I even sat next to him as he sharpened the blade." </p>

          <p>The First Owner of the Edge of Sanity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's never been clear who first owned the Edge of Sanity, because Agrif disappeared after its forging.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the dead of night, Agrif left the forge with the Edge of Sanity in tow. No one can confirm what happened after because the weaponsmith was found dead in the forest more than a month later. Murder would have seemed an obvious conclusion, but the Edge of Sanity was found next to Agrif in pristine condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few days before Agrif was found, a gatherer swore that she had heard Agrif cry out "Leave me alone!" from the darkness of the forest. An investigation was launched to determine if another was involved in Agrif's death, but it ended with no leads.</p>

          <p>The Forging of the Edge of Sanity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are a number of rumors about the material components that went into the forging of the Edge of Sanity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most interesting rumor states that the Edge of Sanity was created with metals the Shedim Lords Zikel and Triniel infused with Aether. Their power is immense, but also mysterious. None except they themselves are aware of the extent of their power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With that taken into consideration, this rumor might not be complete nonsense. However, Zikel and Triniel have never commented on it.</p>

          <p>The Shugo and the Edge of Sanity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This rumor is difficult to believe, but it is nonetheless true: a Shugo named Smirunerk, who happened to be a member of the Black Cloud Traders, wielded the Edge of Sanity for a time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Smirunerk discovered a Daeva in Reshanta who was slaughtering Balaur by the droves. The Daeva appeared insane--he crashed through ranks of the Balaur screaming nonsense, wielding a sword with tendrils of darkness seeping from its blade. It was a massacre, and when it ended, Smirunerk hid for fear of his life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Daeva stood there for a time, then collapsed. Smirunerk thought he was dead, but when he mustered the courage to approach, he found the Daeva was asleep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sword, which Smirunerk knew had to be the famed Edge of Sanity, lie at the Daeva's side. Smirunerk took the sword, planning to sell it. But as he carried the sword in his pack, he started to hear whispers in the back of his mind, and he desired to keep it.</p>

          <p>Smirunerk abandoned his responsibilities as a Black Cloud Trader, and found himself drawn to Mt. Musphel in Morheim. It was there he lived in a cave for some time. No one can be certain how long he lived in the cave, but when he emerged  his hair was gone and he looked like a skeleton.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Smirunerk never let go of the Edge of Sanity, and attacked all who showed interest in it. But as luck would have it, Smirunerk had no idea how to use a sword, so no one was injured.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In time, a report that an aggressive Shugo was attacking people with a menacing sword reached the Archon Itar in Reshanta. Even now, the name Itar and the destruction he wrought is well-known. However, Itar would also be the last owner of the Edge of Sanity.</p>

          <p>The Destruction of the Edge of Sanity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Edge of Sanity had ruined the lives of all its past owners, but the power one commanded while wielding it was intoxicating. There were some still who craved its power. The sword's final owner, Itar, was no different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Itar had been tracking down rumors of the Edge of Sanity for some time, and when he heard of the insane Shugo living on Mt. Musphel, he grew suspicious. Itar left his post in Reshanta without word, and after several days of search, he found Smirunerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While it is conceivable that Itar could have taken the sword from Smirunerk by force, he used a more clever method. When Itar approached, Smirunerk became aggressive, but then Itar pulled out a handful of Shugo Grass and waved it in front of the Shugo's nose--the Edge of Sanity dropped to his side without a word.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Itar traveled back to Reshanta with the sword in tow. His exploits there are well known, as is the madness that consumed him. Though Itar earned fame in Reshanta for a time, his name will forever bear the taint of the Edge of Sanity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Itar had taken tremendous precautions to resist the sword's curse, all his planning was in vain. The Edge of Sanity is too powerful, even for an Archon like Itar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, the Shedim Lords were forced to put mad Itar to sleep. The Lords then shattered the Edge of Sanity into eight pieces, and sealed them in Reshanta. Such was the end of the Edge of Sanity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, there is one more rumor: that if all the shattered pieces were reunited, the sword could be reforged...</p>
