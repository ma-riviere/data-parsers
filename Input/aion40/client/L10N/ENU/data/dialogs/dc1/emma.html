          <p>Wow! Pandaemonium's crowded, huh? Sooo many people are here for the Ascension Festival. It's a good thing I brought lots of presents!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've been collecting Ascension Energy, right? Oooh, goodie! Hand it over and you can take one of these presents. They're all wrapped, and I don't know what's in each one, but I'd never give out just any old trash.</p>
