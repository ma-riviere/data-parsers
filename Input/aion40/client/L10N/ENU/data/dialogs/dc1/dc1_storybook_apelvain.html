          <p>Zannuto.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A highly-respected member of Pandaemonium society, he made his fortune transporting Kisks into the Abyss. Unlike other Vanahal families, none of his children ever ascended.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As they continued to age, rumors spread that he was not of true Vanahal stock. Desperate to prove himself, he fathered more and more children. All Human, to their dying day.</p>

          <p>Kinterun, Master Armorsmith of Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only is he the greatest armorsmith in history (just ask him), he has won the nightly Apellbine Tavern's "How many different swear words can you use in a single sentence?" contest for the last 157 years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Over that span, he has invented many of his own, including "thrice-drakblasted," "balflindered," "balscalesnogging," and the cryptic but effective "flerp."</p>

          <p>Jakwillem, the Butcher of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jakwillem is perhaps the fiercest warrior in the Abyss. With his mighty greataxe, "Sunshredder," he has slaughtered entire Legions of Elyos with unmatched fury.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Elysea fears the sight of his bloodied battle standard. No-one knows what drives this terrifying soldier of destruction, but it is clear he will not rest until every last Elyos is dead.</p>

          <p>Armandino and Batali, Daevas of Cooking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These father and son chefs specialize in sausages. Starting with simple ingredients like Ksellids and Brax, they branched out when they discovered that every part of the Balaur was edible, if prepared properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their knife skills are considerable, and their contributions to both the feeding and defense of Asmodae are many.</p>

          <p>Sarayon, Daeva of the Woods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sarayon refused to fight in the Abyss War, choosing to protect the beauty of the Moslan Forest instead. The Shedim Lords feared her defiance would set a dangerous precedent, and sent a full legion into the woods to find her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a week of searching, they emerged empty-handed. Though she has never been seen again, woodsmen who travel the forest sometimes return with tales of a kind presence watching over them.</p>

          <p>Ulut, Daeva of Chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Human, Ulut once wagered with Marchutan, the Lord of Fate, as to whether or not he would ever ascend. Marchutan prophesied that it was not his fate to ascend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ulut argued that chance, not fate, ruled the universe, and left to pursue his ascension. One year later, Ulut returned with his wings. Marchutan honored the wager, declaring that Ulut would be known henceforth as the Daeva of Chance.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Rikjluk could never find a task that suited him. Fighting in the Abyss War, he said that violence was not to his taste. As a Soul Healer, he tired of standing by an Obelisk day and night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Poet, Porter, Priest or Potter, after many decades nothing has proven to his taste.</p>

          <p>Deyla, Daeva of Deduction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deyla has solved many famous crimes, including the Case of the Crimson Balaur, the Pandaemonium Vanishment Affair, the Mystery of the Shattered Kisk, and many more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to her immortal patience and dedication, she has never failed to close a case. Though centuries may pass since the crime was committed, Deyla will always solve it.</p>

          <p>Kaspar, Daeva of the Sublime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kaspar was known for his belief that Aion could only be communed with in solitude, surrounded by the grandeur of nature. He called the snow-capped mountains his temple and said he heard the voice of Aion in the roar of the storm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though his theories have now fallen out of favor, he was influential to the Aetheric Universalists and many other religious movements.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>A famous novelist as a Human, after ascension Sifdal found that no matter how badly he wanted to, he could not write. The endless parade of life swirled around him as he watched everyone live out the stories of their lives, unable to find any inspiration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For Sifdal, lifted from the flow of mortal life, it was as if he could no longer relate to anything as he once did.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Alorac's roots grew in a Morheim farm. The opulence of Pandaemonium shocked him after his ascension. The very night he arrived, he fled the city, never to return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He made a home in a cave deep in the desert of Morheim, where he lives to this day. He does not speak, but offers a simple gift of bread to any visitor.</p>

          <p>Bartolom, Daeva of the Rainbow Wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bartolom was a great alchemist who once single-handedly defended Kysis Fortress against a powerful Balaur assault. Using only materials found around the fortress, he concocted a wide variety of explosive, poisonous, and otherwise deadly potions to repel the invaders, while at the same time supplying healing and strengthening potions to his fallen brothers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a week, reinforcements arrived to discover Bartolom's wings stained many colors by the chemicals he'd dealt with.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Athelrig and Bradruc first met, it was clear they were two halves of the same soul. Bradruc the Warrior strode into the heart of the battlefield while Athelrig the Priest follow, healing his wounds. The sight of Bradruc's smiling face covered in blood and sweat was the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After countless battles, the two married and retired to a quiet life in Altgard. Their love is the subject of many plays; they attend every one.</p>

          <p>Krantora, Daeva of Hatred.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Krantora swore revenge on the Elyos general Taraion, who killed and Vanished her best friend in the Abyss. The two clashed many times, but as Daevas, each death was only a temporary setback.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She sought to lure him deep into the Abyss, far from any Obelisk or Kisk and kill him forever. Neither was ever seen again....</p>

          <p>Entoryn, Daeva of Lies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Entoryn's web of manipulation stretched across all Pandaemonium. It was whispered that even the Empyrean Lords feared his power. He trusted no-one except his young, beautiful wife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, his bid to become the city's "shadow king" came to a crashing halt. No-one would repay his favors, no-one would heed his threats. His wife only smiled, walking away with the words, "such is the power of misplaced trust."</p>
