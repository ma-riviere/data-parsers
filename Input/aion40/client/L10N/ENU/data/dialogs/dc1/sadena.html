          <p>I'm sure it suits your purposes perfectly well. But the only apparel I consider worthy of my attention is tailored by Eiren.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>Fashion is so important! Everything is an accessory! I know I could only be seen with a man who dressed in Eiren clothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, an Eiren outfit is probably a bit out of your price range.</p>
