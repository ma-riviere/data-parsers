          <p>There's so much to study and learn in the world. It's lucky we Daevas have an eternity in which to do it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For me it's especially good--I just can't restrict myself to a single field. I divide my time between history, ecology, engineering...everything is related, you know!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last century the flora and fauna of Ishalgen, Altgard, and Morheim grabbed my interest. Now I'm drawn to ancient history. It's all right here! There's no place I'd rather be than the Temple of Knowledge.</p>
