          <p>The Invasion is a pivotal moment in our history. After centuries of isolation following the Cataclysm, it was the first time the survival of any of the missing Five Empyrean Lords or their followers was confirmed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The existence of the Elyos society on the opposite continent cast our experiences into sharp relief. Comparing our lot with our soon-to-be enemies' allowed us to appreciate our true strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The story of the invasion begins with Deltras and the Storm Legion.</p>

          <p>Lead by Deltras, the Storm Legion was one of the most elite Legions in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The prevailing opinion is that their mission was strictly reconnaissance. They never intended to confront our forces, and certainly not Lord Zikel himself, which explains their lack of preparation for the event.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Had this incursion not been discovered, it seems likely that a larger Elyos force would have followed, perhaps achieving complete surprise. The capture of Deltras and his Legion was a fortuitous event for Asmodae.</p>

          <p>Credit for detecting the invasion goes to a desert scout of Morheim whose name has sadly been lost to history. Noticing movement in the terrain, he approached and was surprised to discover slender, milky-skinned warriors with neither manes nor sharp claws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seeing the Elyos for the first time, he was more curious than worried about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the Elyos language was incomprehensible, and when Deltras grew weary of the effort to communicate, he ordered his Legion to dispatch the dutiful Asmodian Archon.</p>

          <p>When the Archon resurrected at an Obelisk, he reported these events to incredulous superiors. Shamefully, they were slow to act on this initial incident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime Deltras and his men crossed the Salintus Desert, seeking the rift through which they had traveled to Asmodae so they could return with the information they had gathered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, their grace period was short-lived. When they reached the rift, Lord Zikel and his Shadow's Guard Legion were waiting for them.</p>

          <p>Lord Zikel was in a foul temper, as his scouts had never returned from the Abyss, and he saw reason to believe that the Elyos had intercepted them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to his attendants, Lord Zikel was so upset that even Lord Azphel hesitated to speak to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Archons advised Lord Zikel to kill the Elyos immediately, but he rejected this suggestion. He wanted answers.</p>

          <p>They found common ground in an ancient Human tongue, and Zikel made an offer. He'd spare their lives if Deltras would confess his mission to spy on Asmodae, and deny his Empyrean Lord Nezekan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Typical of the prideful and self-absorbed Elyos, Deltras cursed this generous offer, dooming himself and his Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>True to his word, Lord Zikel Vanished most of the Elyos where they stood. Some cowards killed themselves rather than face his fury.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From that moment forward, we have been at war.</p>
