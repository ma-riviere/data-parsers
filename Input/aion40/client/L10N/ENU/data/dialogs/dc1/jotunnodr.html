          <p>After centuries of sorcerous research, there's no chasm I can't bridge. The Shadow Court's pursued me for it, so I must be cautious, but...tell me, have you ever felt...different, somehow, inside than outside?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have the power to help you. Male and female? Locked doors, friend, but I have the key. But first, show me you want it. I mean, REALLY want it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Find a Gender Switch Ticket. Your only clue? They're with someone I trust. Then, maybe...I'll grant your little "wish."</p>
