          <p>I hate standing here all day. My feet ache, and the Daevas I deal with are a mixed bag at best. No offense, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know what I do is necessary, and I'm proud to do it, but it's not the most glamorous job on the crew. You know what I mean?</p>
