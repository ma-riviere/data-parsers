          <p>Interested in sword fighting, [%userclass]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a useful skill--unless you're scared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not fear death. I risk my life every time I step into the Arena.</p>

          <p>It's only when death is close at hand you feel truly alive. </p>

          <p>That's how the Arena makes me feel. Here, I'm who I want to be. The moment I leave, all the fear comes back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, if I can only be brave some of the time, I'm glad it's when someone charges me with sword in hand!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>She was married once, to a farmer the Lepharists killed for his harvest. Her grief was like a disease, eating her alive. When she decided to leave her village, I brought her with me to Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was only trying to take care of her. I never planned to fall in love.</p>

          <p>Trouble--yes. Once someone's had their heart broken... She won't let me in.</p>

          <p>I can't just forget her. I wait, but I fear she'll never heal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I cling to this sword instead. I have to hold on to something.</p>
