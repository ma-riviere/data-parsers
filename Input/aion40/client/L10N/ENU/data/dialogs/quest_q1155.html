          <p>Do you remember when you brought some supplies over to us? The ones William told you about?</p>

          <p>Oh, yes. The Dukaki Kobolds. They haven't even tried to cover their tracks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They took odds and ends at first, things they could eat or use. Shiny objects. Now they've broken into the Watch storehouse.</p>

          <p>I know. I'm having the doors reinforced and I've put a guard in place round the clock, but we're still down an entire delivery's worth of supplies! Someone needs to go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA12] and fetch them back.</p>

          <p>Thank you. If the Watch is going to work at all, the members need to feel like they can get things done. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they knew the Kobolds were stealing their supplies and laughing at them, they might be tempted to give up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kobolds usually stash their goods in crates. Try searching those, if you see any.</p>

          <p>Well, so much for the Tolbas Watch. It was great while it lasted.</p>

          <p>Maybe if I rally everyone together for one big raid on the mine. We might succeed. But I don't think I could live with myself if there were casualties.</p>

          <p>Thank the Five you were able to get these back before the Kobolds could use them. Can you imagine if we'd found one of our men with our own weapons stuck in him?</p>
