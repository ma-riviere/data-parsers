          <p>One of my men just returned from Baltasar Cemetery with a report of a strange skull that's talking to anyone living who passes by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It claims its name is Groznak and asks for help.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I knew a Human named Groznak once, before I ascended. What are the odds this could be the same person? And yet...</p>

          <p>Of course I wonder. A talking skull with the same name? Who could invent such a thing?</p>

          <p>I'd go myself, but we're so shorthanded, neither I nor any of my troops can be spared to investigate.</p>

          <p>My name is--was--Groznak. I met my destiny bravely, if I may flatter myself. My death came suddenly, however, and there was no one left to care for me. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had no burial. My body is missing a few essential parts and without it I am trapped here, disgraced and forgotten. I fear that the evil of this place will eventually corrupt my mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't expect that you would find my own limbs, Daeva. But even a mismatched body would be a release I can only imagine. Look to the southeast throughout the cemetery and see what you can find. A few bones from the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2A_Corpse_Q4038A], the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2A_Corpse_Q4038B], and the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2A_Corpse_Q4038C] might suit me. My gratitude will be eternal.</p>
