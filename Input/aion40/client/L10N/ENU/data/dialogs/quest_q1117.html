          <p>Wonderful. More mercenaries. And where exactly is our money going? And what do we have to show for it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen Ager's farm, and the Kerubs that still infest it. We farmers watch you and your companions occasionally kill one while we grow hungrier with each passing day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, the vermin have reached my doorstep, and I must use my tools as weapons. What else am I to do? I can't work, can't sell my crop, and the little money that I do have is spent paying you mercenaries.</p>

          <p>Look... I'm sorry. I'm just talking. I know you've an entire village to protect, but I'm exhausted from defending my home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm strong enough to defend this place by myself, you see. Used to serve as a guard in the village. But I find myself fighting the Kerubs day and night, and I just can't handle the work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For starters, I can't see at night, not like the Kerubs can. If you could gather some lights for me, I'd have a much easier time of things. But... where can you buy lights? Hmm...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! Of course! The [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA08]s! [%username], could you bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA12]? They attract mates at night with their glowing bodies, and I could use them to light my home!</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps mercenaries are decent folk after all. I apologize if I was too harsh earlier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think three clumps of [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA12] will be more than sufficient to light my farm. Please, bring them as soon as you can.</p>
