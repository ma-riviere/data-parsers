          <p>[%username], help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's about the Spriggs! After you handed that death threat over to Mirka, we sat about and hatched a plan to completely devastate them. It was brilliant. It was perfect. It was flawless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then one of the Spriggs somehow snuck in and stole it.</p>

          <p>We have to get them back, [%username]. If they get a chance to read our plans, and somehow figure out what we're up to, they'll reinforce their weak spots and we'll have to start from scratch.</p>

          <p>Ok. Good!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, there are two sets of plans out there. One was written by me, the other by Mirka. We need to recover both, else the Spriggs will have us figured out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The plans will most likely be on the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg2_32_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg3_33_An]s. They're the fastest of the Spriggs, and the ones who can figure out which way is north on the plans.</p>
