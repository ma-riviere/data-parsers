          <p>Oh hello, [%username]. You've come at just the right time. I was about to call you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of Arbolu? He's a tree with mysterious power in the north end of Heiron. He blocks harmful energy, enhances the vitality of plants, and repels undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Arbolu is the reason there are so many Elim around there.</p>

          <p>Usually it is, but I hear that plants around Arbolu's Haven have begun to wither and die. It seems Arbolu's energy is waning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas of Life are investigating, but the cause has eluded them.</p>

          <p>They've asked me to send something to revive the plants.</p>

          <p>Well there's no way to know for sure, but my theory is that the soil is running out of nutritive elements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've gathered up some good soil, and I need someone to take this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erone], Daeva of Life, and tell her to sprinkle it around the ailing trees.</p>

          <p>It's kind of you to volunteer. I don't relish losing any more messengers on that run. Arbolu's Haven is east of the jungle. You should be careful of undead along the way, but from what I hear you should be able to handle them.</p>
