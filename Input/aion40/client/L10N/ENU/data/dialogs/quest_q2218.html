          <p>It's a grain that grows just about anywhere. A priest I know in Basfelt Village wants some to cultivate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're having problems with Mosbears, and the Frightcorn would supplement their food stores. Even a novice farmer can grow it with ease, and it tastes great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a problem, though...</p>

          <p>Here in Altgard, the only place to get it right now is the MuMu Farmland.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a gatherer, not a warrior. All the Sapiens working and patrolling the area frighten me something awful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I was thinking, a Daeva like you... Could you help the village and gather the seeds?</p>

          <p>Wow! What they're saying about you is true.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find the seeds in sacks carried by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanGathererM_11_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanGathererMS_11_An]s, or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanGathererMS_13_An]s. </p>

          <p>Tigg needed to procure some seeds  Priest Gefion asked for. He knew Frightcorn would be the perfect crop for novice farmers, but he was worried since they only come from the MuMu Farmland.</p>

          <p>At his request, you snatched Frightcorn Seeds after defeating MuMu Farmers and Gatherers. Tigg thanked you for your help.</p>
