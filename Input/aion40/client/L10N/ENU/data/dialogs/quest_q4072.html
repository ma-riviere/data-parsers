          <p>I just received a new memo from the Manastone Removers Association. I always look forward to the newsletter. It's nice to see what other Manastone Removers are doing. Tips and tricks, lifestyle advice, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, we end up with a lot of used manastones--did you ever wonder what we do with them? I bet you never gave it a second thought!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some are useful, but many are just junk. They usually can't be resold.</p>

          <p>That's what this memo is about. It's a trade-in program for old manastones. The MRA will use them for research and training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plus if I contribute a lot of stones to the program I'll get my name in the newsletter! And I see a loophole here. It doesn't say they have to be removed manastones!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So [%username]...can you help me get my name in the paper? If you have useless manastones, I'll exchange them for a useful one.</p>

          <p>All right. Then bring me HP +60, Accuracy +20, and Block +20 manastones. Those are the ones the program is looking for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll exchange them for another manastone. You get a good manastone, the MRA gets stones for research, and I get my name in the newsletter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like killing three birds with one...manastone!</p>

          <p>Just remember the motto of the Manastone Removers Association. "Removing manastones is dangerous. Always employ a professional manastone remover. Trying to remove your own manastones can result in serious injury or even death."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes the injury can happen when you're walking home or having dinner with friends later. If you know what I mean.</p>

          <p>I heard a rumor that the Manastone Removers Association is researching a multi-faceted manastone. If the research is successful, they could make a manastone that enhances several things at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe it'll never work, but it's sure interesting to consider. I wonder if they'll be more difficult to remove?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you bring the manastones I told you about? I'll exchange HP +60, Accuracy +20, and Block +20 for another manastone.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I can almost see my name in the MRA Newsletter already! I'll give you a new manastone now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure you'll like it, but it's sure to be better than the manastones you brought me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have plenty of manastones for exchange. So if you have more unused manastones, just bring them to me.</p>
