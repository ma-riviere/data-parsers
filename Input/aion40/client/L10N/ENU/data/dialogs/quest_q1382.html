          <p>A Wind Breeze Merchant said he sold food to a group nearby.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They must have lost their village to the desert, and they're wandering around homeless. I'm worried for them.</p>

          <p>Yes! And the Shugos saw them near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_F2].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm really afraid they'll cross paths with the Lepharist Revolutionaries. They're very close by!</p>

          <p>Their leader was called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Turiel]. Be polite, but firm.</p>

          <p>Esaias heard from a Wind Breeze Merchant of some refugees wandering lost in the desert, and asked you to lead them to Agairon Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You sought out Turiel, the refugees' leader. She was glad they'd been found, but said they couldn't move on without time to rest and heal.</p>
