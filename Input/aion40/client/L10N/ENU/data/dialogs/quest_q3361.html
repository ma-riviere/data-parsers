          <p>This village is quite desolate, isn't it? Still, it's a lot better than when I first came here. We all slept on the ground then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we have an Obelisk and actual merchants. It finally looks like a real village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The biggest problem remaining is finding a dependable source of food near the village.</p>

          <p>We used to be able to collect the Litreas and Tanges around Latheron Coast, but these days the Vespines, Hornskulls and Mudthorns are eating them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes I go to the coast with my brother and hunt them, but they breed so fast, there's no end.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we are asking Daevas to kill them for us. You're the only ones who can kill enough of them fast enough to make a difference.</p>
