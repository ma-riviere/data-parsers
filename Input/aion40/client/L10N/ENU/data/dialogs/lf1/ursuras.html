          <p>Time seems to move so fast....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems not long ago they discovered the Abyss Gate in the skies of Verteron. That was real news, not like the petty gossip that passes amongst our people now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was the Aetheric energy, raw and unstable. Eventually, all that unharnessed energy came together and the Abyss Gate was born.</p>    
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, years have passed since then....</p>

          <p>Not as much as I'd like to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are others with more knowledge than I. I remember a few of them, fearless Daevas, heading off into the sky to investigate.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>Trust me. You don't want to follow them. Not only for your own sake, but for the balance of the Aether. It's unstable enough as it is. Who knows what could set it off?!</p>
