          <P>Ah, a traveler! Just the person I've been looking for. I've heard stories of a strange group...not the Lepharists, but another group, calling themselves the Disciples of Kalil.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>You see, this Kalil fellow was apparently some sort of Prophet, and wrote a book detailing the futures of both the Asmodian and Elyos peoples. This book is said to still exist somewhere, though its exact location is unknown.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <p>Obviously, I'm not one to believe in any of this hocus-pocus nonsense, though I do find the thought that such an item exists very exciting.</p>

          <p>Well...as with all prophets, he's as vague as possible and makes almost no sense. I mean, some of his suggestions, if I've understood correctly, are ludicrous!</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>The unification of the Elyos and the Asmodian people, for instance! The thought alone is...is preposterous!</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>If you hear anything though...do let me know, won't you?</P>
