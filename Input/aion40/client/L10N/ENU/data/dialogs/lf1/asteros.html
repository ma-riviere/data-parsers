          <p>The great Daeva, Akarios, gave his life in defense of this village many years ago.</p>

          <p>Akarios, and all those chosen for ascension, possessed the same powers that our Seraphim Lords wield. A Daeva must accept the responsibility that power brings, and the good that they are capable of achieving.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sense something special in you. To not realize that potential would be a terrible, terrible shame, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I fear that your mercenary heart may not be inclined to use your skills for the benefit of Elysea.</p>
