          <p>New to flying, aren't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can tell. Rookies lack poise in the sky, and always end up looking rushed. That's the key to flight--look as though you haven't a care in the world, but know exactly when to land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, my apologies! I don't mean to put you off. We must each learn our own way, and I have to remember a Daeva's first flight is never going to be graceful.</p>
