          <p>Have you met my father, Ivis? That's his store over there. He makes and sells weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Growing up, I never played with toy soldiers or wooden swords. I had real weapons to play with. We were allowed to handle them, if we were careful and responsible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We learned all the weapons' names, what they're used for, where they came from, and how they're made. Now I can recognize anything!</p>

          <p>Oh. Are you testing me? Okay, I'll do my best.</p>

          <p>You're weilding...uh... [%mainslotitem], I think. Yes! And it suits you well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I grow up, I'll be just like my father. I'll have a shop of my own, and I'll sell weapons everyone will want. They'll be well crafted, but I won't make them expensive, because it's not right to be greedy like a nasty old Shugo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you come and be my customer, when I open my store?</p>

          <p>And if you don't come, I'll tell everyone that you broke your word, and your honor will be stained, and you will have to go on a quest or something, to redeem yourself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I jest, of course. I wouldn't really do that.</p>
