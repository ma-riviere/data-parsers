          <p>Just a word of advice for you: should you find yourself in Akarios Village, don't let Kustanon teleport you unless you absolutely must.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a decent fellow, but a little too simple to be running a teleportation service, if you catch my meaning.</p>

          <p>I am afraid I can only teleport you as far as Akarios Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Longer distances are a far more dangerous process, one that only a Daeva is likely to survive without incident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The weaker Aetheric fields of ordinary Humans, it seems, makes them far more likely to be teleported off-course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have heard horror stories of Humans sent to the Abyss to be butchered by Balaur, or flung far beyond the reach of this world....</p>
