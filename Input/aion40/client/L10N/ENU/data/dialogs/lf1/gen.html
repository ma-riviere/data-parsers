          <p>There's only one place more important to Verteron than the citadel: the Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is where we monitor the field and do our best to ensure its strength is maintained.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the field were to fail, the Balaur would rain down on us from the Abyss. It would be the Age of the Balaur all over again.</p>
