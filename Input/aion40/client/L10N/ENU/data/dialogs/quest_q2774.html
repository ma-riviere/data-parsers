          <p>I'm a soldier, not a scholar. So you can imagine my disappointment when Grunn assigned me to help Midori investigate his theory on the strange stones sprouting up all around the Ruins of Roah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's got us out here conducting a few tests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Grunn suspects the wardstones are connected to the fragmentation of Aion. And their unusual natures might support that.</p>

          <p>Midori discovered the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2774a] inside the first wardstone we investigated. While we were both thrilled at the discovery, the wardstone injured her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those things are scrappy little fighters for a pillar of stone! We need more crystals from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_SAM_30_An]s, but I'm assigned to watch over and protect Midori, and she won't go near another one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look to be more soldier than scholar, which is just what I need. </p>

          <p>It's possible the Wardstone started to move in order to protect its crystal, rather than the crystal naturally growing inside the Wardstone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine a rock, a lifeless thing animated by the crystal inside and driven to protect itself. If we could harness that, think of the applications for our military stations and fortresses!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's imperative we get more [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2774a]s to study. These [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_SAM_30_An] are scattered all over the Floating Island near the Ruins of Roah.</p>

          <p>We need several crystals. Each of the tests destroys the sample. I'm sorry if I wasn't clearer about that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Find some more [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_SAM_30_An]s, and bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2774a]s to me.</p>

          <p>Excellent. With this many samples, the tests should take no time at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you didn't find the wardstones to be too disturbing. I mean...living, breathing, fighting rock!</p>

          <p>Anyway, Midori and I should get to work on this.</p>
