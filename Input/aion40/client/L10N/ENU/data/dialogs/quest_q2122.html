          <p>Such...courage in you. Most turn and flee at the mere sight of me. But you sought me out, and I see no fear in your eyes.</p>

          <p>Indeed, you have nothing to fear. I am a shade...a spirit...nothing more. But my veins once surged with Asmodian blood, like yours. My body shivered in the cold wind, like yours.</p>

          <p>Yes, indeed. That was my necklace many years ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back when the prison had more than one prisoner, I was one of the guards. In those days, this place was teeming with the living: prisoners, guards, families paying respects in this graveyard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then everything changed. All because of me....</p>

          <p>It was my first shift on the night watch. Even now, I can't forget that night. </p>

          <p>The prisoners were all sound asleep, so I wandered down to the graveyard. I remember the smell of the freshly turned soil and the cool breeze on my cheeks. I'd been on watch for about an hour, and then I...I fell asleep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I woke to the sound of screaming. The prisoners had broken free and butchered all in their path. By the time I reached the village, the convicts were gone. I was left looking into the lifeless eyes of the children who had relied on my protection.</p>
