          <p>Ascension is a moment to relish, Daeva. The fruition of your Aetheric bond is a testament to your gifts. But your new powers are also constrained by great responsibilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I meet many new Daevas and have grown accustomed seeing to caution, uncertainty, and even fear on their faces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet you stand unmoved, unwavering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, your countenance is more that of a weathered veteran than a newly-ascended Daeva. Why is that?</p>

          <p>I see. And this was in Karamatis, you say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know little of the Abyss, but the name Karamatis is grimly intoned by those who know it. The region is said to be rife with Balaur, though this is the first I have heard of a battle there.</p>

          <p>A Daeva who has lost power and memory, re-rendered into Human form--it's unheard of. I must consult Jucleas to discern the truth of it before we can discuss this further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I said that grave danger lies ahead--this is the path of the Daeva. Whatever Pernos showed you, for now you must focus on the task at hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Verteron Citadel needs assistance, but before you, there was no one to send. Go quickly.</p>

          <p>I welcome your enthusiasm, as does Elysea. We must never forget who we were before ascension, lest we prove unworthy of our Aetheric powers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Verteron is taking heavy losses against the Tursin Krall. We also hear a group resembling the Lepharist Revolutionaries is active in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Polyidus] in the Gate of Sanctum about teleportation to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09]. He'll set you on your way.</p>
