          <p>Well that's just great. I know the villagers call me names, disparage my lifestyle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I wasn't like that from the start. After my fiance betrayed me, I thought I couldn't trust anyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I kept people at a distance, using them, rather than being used by them. But maybe I wasn't betrayed after all. </p>

          <p>My fiance was a sailor. Berus, Captain of the Argos. We were planning our wedding, when the villagers asked him to sail to Verteron. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked him not to go, but he said it wouldn't take long, and the wedding would take place when he returned. But he never came back. I thought he fled because he didn't want me. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shipwreck...I'm begging you. Could you please go to the shipwreck and look for [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1635a]?</p>
