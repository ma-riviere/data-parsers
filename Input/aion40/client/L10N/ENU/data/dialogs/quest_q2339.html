          <p>What do you mean, what manastone? You can't see it because I just removed it! Who's the expert here, [%userclass], you or me?</p>

          <p>Or maybe I just like the quiet for its own sake. Can you blame me?</p>

          <p>I have a ridiculous quota of unused manastones. If your superiors were as clueless as mine, you'd be grumpy, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know how frustrating conflicting orders are, I'll bet. On the one hand, I'm supposed to stay here. On the other hand, I need to gather as many MP +40, Evasion +8, and Parry +16 manastones as I can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tell you, [%username], I'd be slightly less grumpy if you brought me a set: one of each. Do that, and I'll give you a manastone better than any of those.</p>

          <p>Congratulations, Daeva: you can assemble sets of...three. OK, maybe not so impressive, but hey! You did what I asked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's a new manastone. I hope it's useful.</p>
