          <p>My dad tried to hurt me when he turned into an undead.</p>

          <p>If we pray eagerly to the Shedim Lords, I hope my dad will get better. So everyday I pray, but there's still no answer.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. My father used to say that the Shedim Lords favor prayers on a Moonstone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I had a [%dic:STR_DIC_DF3_jewelry_n_c_30c], maybe they'd listen.</p>
          <p> </p>
