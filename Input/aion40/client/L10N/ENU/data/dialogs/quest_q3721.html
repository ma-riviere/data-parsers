          <p>We've got a real problem, [%username]! A real problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's so much work to be done before storming into Tiamaranta. Yet Sanctum keeps leaning on my Hushblade Legion to do it all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every mission, every operation, every damn task.... And now they're discussing having us take care of the Chantra Dredgion.</p>

          <p>Thinner than a hungry Reian! We keep losing the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A] to the Balaur forces and their damn dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't seem to get any reinforcements in there, but that Chantra Dredgion keeps dropping fresh troops and supplies behind our lines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We take the fortresses, then they take it back. It's become a war of attriton, and not in our favor. Would you see what you could do, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent. I appreciate this, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, check in with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Yannis]. He'll get you up to speed on the mission.</p>

          <p>You won't be entirely alone...but watch your back.</p>

          <p>Ah, you're the [%userclass] Brigade General Yulia sent over. I heard that you had some experience with the dredgion in Reshanta...this shouldn't be too much different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The basic structure of the Chantra Dredgion is the same, but the objective itself is a bit different. Our goal is to take out their supplies and reserve soldiers before they arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First and foremost, take the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDreadgion_02_Drakanbox_Q3721] from the ship's arsenal.</p>

          <p>Zanata is not a typical Drakan soldier. Some rumors even say that he is the right hand of Tiamat, though that hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's one of their toughest combatants, [%username]. If you can take him out, it'll deal a major blow to troop morale.</p>
