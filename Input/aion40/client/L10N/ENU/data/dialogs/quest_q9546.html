          <p>If you're a real Daeva, you should at least go to Reshanta and have the Fortress Battle experience.</p>

          <p>To be frank, a Daeva who doesn't have the Fortress Battle experience in Abyss cannot be a real Daeva. </p>

          <p>But you need a firm determination to join the Fortress Battle in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I say you need as much determination as... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to be determined to go to flat rate pricing plan as soon as Aion launches its charge scheme. Umm, I say, at least for three months.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you sure you're going to do that?</p>
