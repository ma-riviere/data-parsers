          <p>Dear Araison, </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to see you sad, but I still have to write this letter because I believe that you will hurt less now than later.</p>

          <p>I am fully aware of your mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know how much you missed me and how much efforts you've made to catch my eyes and feel my touch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think you are not enough for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I saw you singing a song with your beautiful voice, I was moved and fluttered as much as other admirers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I cannot agree to the way you expressed your love.</p>

          <p>You need more than flattery and smile to attract a mature woman, not a young girl.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Persistent courtship only makes a woman lose her interest.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>For the woman who has now returned to the reality, the handsome face of the man only looks greasy and his sweet voice only sounds sticky.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <p>All flowers want to be visited by a butterfly, not by a fly.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I don't mean that you are the fly, but you could look like it to a woman who gets tired of persistent flirt.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>It is too late for regrets. My mind has cooled down already.</p>

          <p>Besides, I am a Human of old age while you are a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need a man who will love only me and grow old together, not one who is always surrounded by women as you are now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I, a Human, will return to the flow of Aether sooner or later. You, a Daeva, will live forever. Can you bear grief and sadness all alone after I die?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want you to waste your eternal life only missing me.</p>
          <P> </P> 
          <p>I cannot accept your love not only for me but also for you.</p>

          <p>So, please stop asking me love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are not meant for each other. That's all. I wish you would not be in grief blaming yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also wish you to soon find another love who will heal your broken heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not doubt that you can easily find a woman much better than me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good bye. </p>
