          <p>Find Tiamat's sword. According to legend, it is double-bladed, and sharp enough to cut a Porgus in two with one stroke. The hilt and pommel are in the form of a dragon's head holding a pearl or similar object in its mouth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once found, transfer the sword by ship to Lighthouse Point. Be very cautious! Pandaemonium has spies everywhere!</p>
