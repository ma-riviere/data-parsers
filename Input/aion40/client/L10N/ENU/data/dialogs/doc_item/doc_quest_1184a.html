          <p>The Water Spirits and Wind Spirits near Miraju's Holy Ground have become violent for unknown reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They attack pilgrims to the Ardus Shrine. We request that all pilgrims be informed of the threat and advised to stay away.</p>

          <p>There seems to be nothing abnormal in the flow of Aether, and this far from the contaminated forest, it's unlikely that toxins are causing it. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're so short-handed here it seems unlikely our investigations will turn anything up--all our men are busy fighting the spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the situation doesn't improve, it may be best to blockade Miraju's Holy Ground and prohibit access.</p>
