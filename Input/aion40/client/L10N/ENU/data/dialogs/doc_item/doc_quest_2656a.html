          <p>Betoni,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had never thought to hear from you again, old friend. It stirs shadows in my mind I'd long since thought forgotten. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judging by the way you keep sending [%username] to seek me out, you must be worried. I would not trouble your mind, but I will not go back to Asmodae. The man you knew is gone. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot forget her. She was my life, and in dying she condemned me to the same fate. My body may yet live, but anything more is illusion.</p>

          <p>It's strange. You'll think me insane, no doubt, but in avenging her death as I do, I am happier than I have ever been. My task lies clearly before me. There is no doubt, no confusion about the future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I live remembering Myanee, and I will die with her name on my lips. I appreciate your concern, but it is unfounded. I will never forget her, and I will never return to Asmodae. Think ill of me if you must, but know that I am irrevocably set upon this path. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the name of all we shared, I beg you to accept my decision and move on. There is nothing more you can do, my friend. Aion watch over you and keep you in his blessed shadow.</p>
