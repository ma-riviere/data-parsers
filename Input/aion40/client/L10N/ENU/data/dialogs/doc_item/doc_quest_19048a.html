          <p>Aion may allow his Daevas to use the power of Aether, but a Daeva's true power comes from within their soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, within the soul lies the subconscious, the absolute being which guides us and defines who we are to ourselves and to others. We cannot see it, but we can see its effects through attitudes and responses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So always express yourself. Your movements, from the tiniest smile to the loudest scream, are from a subconscious at work. Embrace its power.</p>
