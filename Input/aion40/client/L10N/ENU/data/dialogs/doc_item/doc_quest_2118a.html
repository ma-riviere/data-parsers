          <p>- Eyvindr Log: Day 1 -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We set sail by order of the Captain to find a treasure called the Black Opal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said we had to voyage to Ishalgen, where none of us had been before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We took on water and food enough to sustain us for 40 days of sailing, and overhauled the ship.</p>

          <p>- Eyvindr Log: Day 10 -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Novan became distressed when he heard what we were hoping to find.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I asked why, he told me the legend of the Black Opal. He says it can change one's future, but there's also a curse associated with it--bad luck and weakness will plague a person from the very moment they decided to pursue the Black Opal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I insisted he was being superstitious, but he kept muttering that he felt something ominous hanging over the ship. His bad mood seemed to spread to everyone on board.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The rudder broke. Fortunately, we had enough spare lumber to fashion a replacement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Novan took the setback as the first sign of the curse, which made the entire crew nervous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must admit, I became nervous myself, simply because we haven't sailed as far as we had planned. As soon as we see land, we must go ashore to get more water and food.</p>

          <p>- Eyvindr Log: Day 25 -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been trapped in the throes of a storm for three days now. The ship has taken on a great deal of water, and all our food stores have been soaked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Captain's in a bad mood. I was afraid Novan's muttering would further anger the Captain, so I ordered Novan to stay in his cabin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>More and more crew have been seeking Novan out to discuss the legend. I wish I could throw him overboard.</p>

          <p>- Eyvindr Log: Day 45 -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dysentery has spread throughout the crew--I suspect caused by wet food. The younger crew members are holding up better than the older ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we could find land--food, fresh water, and especially medicine, our problems will be solved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Novan has been very quiet lately, perhaps because he's ill. I'm thankful for his silence.</p>

          <p>- Eyvindr Log: Day 60 -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still no sign of land.  We're running out of food, but crew members are dying faster than our food is dwindling. Strange that that's the best news of the day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Novan is delirious with fever, muttering constantly about the curse of the Black Opal. Curse or no curse, he will die very soon unless we can find medicine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I found the Black Opal, I would change the past, not the future. I would stop the Captain from ever starting on this voyage--even if it meant doing him harm.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Land! And Ishalgen, no less! We'd settle for anything, but it appears we've reached our destination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The captain has ordered us ashore to secure the small dock we found, then gather supplies and form into search parties--no doubt to find the Black Opal that lured us here in the first place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder where the Captain heard about the Black Opal, and what convinced him to set sail to find it. I wonder whether he knew of the curse before we embarked on this voyage of misery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My spirits are so low these days. For the first time in my life, I regret becoming a Lepharist.</p>
