          <p>Tekor, </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I apologize for my poor handwriting. Hunger won't kill me but it does make my hands shake. Guarding the Observatory requires a lot of energy, and there is little to spare for other pursuits. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I did need to lose some around my waist, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind. One good thing about this, perhaps the attractive Daeva at the Outer Docks will take me up on my offer of companionship now. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please send the grain as you promised. If you are too busy to deliver, I will send an Archon to pick it up. </p>
