          <p> - Report on Abnormal Air Currents in Inggison - </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1. Summary</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Air Line is a highly effective form of transportation but requires costly maintenance and consumes high levels of Aether. New forms of aerial transportation are being considered in this report.</p>

          <p>2. Abnormal Air Currents in Inggison</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Various sources have reported abnormal phenomena in Inggison, including alternate forms of air travel via air channels called Windstreams.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These Windstreams, which can be seen by the naked eye, allow travelers to glide through the air and land at will. This movement does not consume Aether or use body energy.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>- Weeping Valley</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A large Windstream was found in Weeping Valley, in northern Soteria Sanctuary. This air channel will take travelers as far as Angrief Ruins.</p>

          <p>- Undirborg</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An additional Windstream was also found in the skies above Undirborg. This air channel starts atop a hill north of the Fortress and continues above its skies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This Windstream is thought to be very useful for avoiding the Dragonbound in Undirborg. It is unknown whether the Dragonbound know of its existence.</p>

          <p>4. Proposal</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides the two verified locations, these Windstreams are said to exist all over Inggison and possibly Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This report strongly suggests that Kaisinel's Wings Research Center utilize Windstreams for military operations. The strongest supporting reason: conservation of Aether.</p>
