          <p>Location: Reshanta North No. 43-6 Floating Island</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: An explosion incident in the Gun Deck damaged three firearms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We anchored in the Floating Island and capture a useful living creature. We locked up the living creature that we can sell in the Menagerie, and used the rest for food.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Engineer Lahulahu and engineers committed sabotage, demanding a raise in a ration. They said they could not move the ship unless they got what they asked. It was the 129th sabotage, but the captain didn't even raise his eyebrows. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We received a message from Balaurea. It was that the Steel Beard Pirates scouting Abyss safely entered Balaurea, and is now checking its engine.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: OK</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note: The ship crashed into the Floating Island and its stern was damaged. We started to repair it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We plundered a cargo ship of the Black Cloud Traders and obtained jewelry including Malek, Platinum, Mithril, etc. We also took some liquor which became popular among sailors due to its good taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We received the report that the spies we dispatched to Elysea and Asmodae are safely conducting their missions.</p>

          <p>Location: Reshanta Northeast No. 12 Floating Island</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: The stern was completely repaired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We found Elyos and Asmodian Daevas fighting each other. We succeeded in capturing both of them and locked them up in the Prison Zone. It was for the Stigma research of our captain, but the result remains to be seen. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We found a merchant ship of the Black Cloud Traders, but could not plunder. These days it gets harder as Shugos have quick wit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Somlikin was so drunk that he couldn't even recognize the captain. He was warned but he's not likely to get better.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: OK</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Mantutu became wild and violent as we ran out of fresh fruits. Tamer Anikiki still has a hard time to calm him down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Bhagwaninerk fell from the cannon on his way to the steering house to report to the captain and got hurt in the back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We attacked the Black Cloud Traders merchant ship which was passing by. Though we couldn't obtain any good items, we could capture a cube craftsman. We got pleased to see the Shugos in the Black Cloud Traders get vexed.</p>

          <p>Location: Reshanta East, Coordinates 32, 55 </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: The engine malfunction lowered the speed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Engineer Lahulahu and the captain fought seriously. The chief engineer was so angry that he brought Drana to the upper deck and ran about wildly. Other sailors had to run away from him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Chief Mate Menekiki and some sailors argued over the route.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- The captain ordered us to clean the deck to remove the bugs on it, but everybody is just passing the buck to another.</p>

          <p>Location: Reshanta East (estimated)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: The navigator and engine got damaged.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- As the time and space distorted, the navigator went out of order. - Swirled by the distortion, the ship was pushed into the Aetheric Field of Aion. As a strong shock hit the ship at the moment, some of the steam boilers under repair were damaged again and a few apprentice engineers got injured.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- The captain declared a state of emergency. All sailors armed themselves just in case.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We cannot communicate with ships in other regions due to strong power of the Aetheric Field of Aion. That means we cannot request any support. We have to hold at all costs until we can fix the engine.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: We cannot continue our voyage due to a heavy damage on the engine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- We hid the ship in the biggest floating island inside the Aetheric Field and started to fix the engine. But the repair will be delayed because we cannot get necessary parts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- A ship of Humans, either Elyos or Asmodians, passed by the floating island but did not notice us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Some sailors complained that the ship took a wrong route, but Menekiki wielding his sword browbeat them into calming down.</p>

          <p>Ship Conditions: We cannot continue our voyage due to a heavy damage on the engine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Elyos and Asmodian prisoners made a noise. They settled down after the prison guard leader didn't give them two meals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- The captain was very angry at the slow progress of repairs and shut himself up in the steering house. - Bhagwaninerk, who was going to the steering house to calm down the captain, fell off from the cannon and got hurt in the back again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- The shock from the incident destroyed a part of an expensive item we are shipping. We'll have to make a huge compensation for our customer.</p>

          <p>Location: Unknown Floating Island in the center of the Aetheric Field</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ship Conditions: We cannot continue our voyage due to a heavy damage on the engine. About 10% of the repair was completed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- A scout ship of the Black Cloud Traders caught the ship. We attacked it but failed to capture it. All sailors are now on a full alert in case its reinforcement attacks us again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Three more Daevas who were fooled by Roikinerk and Uikinerk arrived at the ship. Someone proposed to stop kidnapping because of the food shortage, but it was rejected. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- There are conflicts between the hard-liners who want to infiltrate into Elysea or Asmodae and the moderates who want to hide until we fix the ship.</p>
