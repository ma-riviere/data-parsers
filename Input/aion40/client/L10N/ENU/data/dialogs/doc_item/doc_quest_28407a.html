          <p>Location: Capitol</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tis a strange strange manner of Drakan who sits upon the city gates. There waits a fine figure, ever patient for fracas and fury.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To mine eyes, this particular guard holds further purpose--for he and I share one countenance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His name is Murugan, and I shall take him wherever I go.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'faith! I vouchsafe me a new and glorious future that peaks over the Tower top, for Tiamat has pique on Drana production at current.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Lord sends me to the Esoterrace as Warden. Mine false face hath schemed its way to a true power, and the Drana floweth freely from my new lands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For certain, Murugan must attend us.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Before we goodbye the Capitol, Lord Tiamat bequeaths his creation to me. I speak now with his name and wield the sword "Tiamat's Power".</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For certes, he knows not my unfaithful heart and its plans of research and destruction. Only Hanumat, beloved rival, speaks hard to me. "Thou mad, wayward feckle!" cries he.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I smile upon his words. For what power hath any courtier over a Dragon Lord's favorite?</p>

          <p>Location: Esoterrace</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Near a cycle spent in the Esoterrace, and Drana shifts through mine plants into hungry purses and pockets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My subordinates plant sabotage, and my brave Murugan scatters potions over Dalia Charlands. The Reian Tribe shakes its wing, but smartly flees my might.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Murugan believes we needs must slaughter them in entirety. He sees not their future uses, which is well for nor doth he see his own future. Brave, innocent Murugan. To be cursed with my face!</p>

          <p>Location: Esoterrace</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the first phase of the Dragel experiment complete, Tiamat's Empyrean bounty needs no more time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Foolish Tiamat! Did he think to watch me, unknown, through his so-called "gift". His masquerade breaks in my hands--sword from hilt, blade from blade. All rent asunder and scattered to isolation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lonely D-----, dear Capt--------, and wayward ---kra. They hold my past, and I hold their lives.</p>

          <p>Location: Esoterrace</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An investigation officer arrives after Drana production figures reach Tiamaranta. How do we double production rates?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The inspector's eyes brim with greed for Dalia Charlands, but they fill also with suspicion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the daily cohort, my change has been slow, but for those we see only rarely... I'm sure Hanumat takes his report even now, and uses the information to scheme against me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My appearance is too, too changed. Next time, I will send Murugan to receive guests. My dear, faithful decoy proves his worth at last!</p>
