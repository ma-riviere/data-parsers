          <p>Continuous attacks from Balaur and undead have placed a great strain on our manpower in Heiron. I have tried to go through official channels in Sanctum, but the response is always the same: "all troops are already committed."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must drive the Balaur out of Elysea! They must not be allowed to have a foothold!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any reinforcements you could send would be invaluable. I await your reply.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the glory of Sanctum!</p>
