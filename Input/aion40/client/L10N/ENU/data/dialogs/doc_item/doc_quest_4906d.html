          <p>Theia's Story </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion was commanded by Brigade General Virkel in the name of Lady Triniel. Most of her generals were Assassins and Rangers, but Virkel was a Templar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Three arrogant brothers, Sirh, Barche, and Bert, served in the Red Sky. They often irritated the General with their bickering, as all three wanted to win the affections of the unit's Cleric, Angeiya.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the Legion showed excellent unity and organization. They drilled constantly, and in combat they moved in perfect unison, always with the fearless Virkel in the lead.</p>

          <p>Hisui's Story </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Virkel and I came up through the ranks together. At the time we met, he was greatly favored by Empyrean Lord Nezekan, who now favors Elysea. Of course this was before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day Virkel suddenly pledged his sword to the service of Lady Triniel. When I asked him why, he said it was his mission, but he wouldn't explain further. Virkel was a loyal man of few words, and he knew how to keep a secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some believe that Lord Nezekan and Lady Triniel were in love, and Nezekan charged Virkel to Triniel's service to protect her. If true, it's very tragic considering what happened later.</p>

          <p>Sigyn's Story </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Red Sky was Lady Triniel's favored Legion and she personally appointed General Virkel to lead them. It caused quite a controversy to have a Templar in her senior ranks, but Virkel soon proved himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When they were sent to defend Brusthonin, some believed the situation was hopeless, that we should withdraw and cede the territory to the Balaur. Everyone was shocked when Virkel and his people sent Beritra and Zunewgishe Legion running!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, though, Red Sky was defeated. Normally a lost Legion is reformed, but Lady Triniel decided against it. No other legion will ever be Red Sky.</p>
