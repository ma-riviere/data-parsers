          <p>I watched another friend fall today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What have they done to deserve this wrath? What could they have possibly done?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I despise the beauty that once danced upon my tongue, my eyes, my beliefs.</p>

          <p>Day 11, Season 01</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our great Lady Siel has forsaken her children. And for what cause, I ask? My people waited patiently for help, prayed for help...only to be replaced in her eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This cruel Balaurea screamed for sacrifice. But what is the point of sacrificing a child only to save a child? But it was all that we could do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My light has died. My gods are dead. The ground beneath my feet and the venom upon my tongue are all that I now adore.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We should not have tasted the bitter juice of Drana. Its vine was as succulent as a broken bone. It fed us for one day, then starved us for a lifetime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The cups of the Balaur and the Dragonbound were full of the sweet Aether we thirsted for. While our lips trembled for just a taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there was no taste...no mercy for us. Our throats drank the Drana that wasn't meant for animals to consume. But our throats drank until our stomachs were full.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We watched Aion's Tower fall from this cruel land of Balaurea. And we could do nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To watch one's own home be taken away, then destroyed...is like a father watching his own son perish slowly in flames. We lost our home, our honor, and our god.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Siel's Spear had broken into pieces. And we could do nothing but hide in caves and bushes. I now believe that the Reian Tribe was never meant to survive.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I watch my family and my friends die off--one by one. Some to the hands of our foes, some from losing the will to carry on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can no longer lift the spirits of my people. There is no longer anything I can do for them. They are dying every day. But I will not sleep their tiny deaths alongside them. I will rage against the dying of our light!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have decided to leave this cemetery of broken spirits. My peace has become fire...fire for everything that has harmed my precious tribe.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Since leaving my people, I have discovered the truth of the stars. My innocent faith had blinded me for a lifetime, but now the veil has been lifted. The truth is here below my feet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have discovered the mighty gods that once walked this land. The Jotun and their disciples, the Petraliths. They know no right and wrong, only creation and labor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a peace within them. They do not argue, they do not complain, they do not die. They are the one true sun that warms this land.</p>

          <p>I have done nothing for many days but watch these Jotun hammer away at creation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are the new gods for the Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may love us, or they may kill us...but either is their choice.</p>

          <p>Those who call themselves the children of light, how I loathe you. I curse the wound you made of my land. I curse you for killing all that I held holy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You disgusting Elyos, with your glowing wings and cherub faces, how I detest each and every mother that birthed you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have taken my land, and my people, and my god. And now you come here to this holy place of the Jotun, and you want to take this as well. But you cannot.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I have watched the Elyos consume this new land like a plague. Conceited animals, killing all who oppose you for the honor of your stolen gods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your wings should be severed from your backs, for you do not deserve the gift of flight. You do not protect the Aetheric Field...you suck its life like a parasite.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>You take and take and take in the name of your gods. Damn you! You will not take this from me!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Everything I have done, I have done for my people. Every step of my journey to this home of the Jotun, has been taken to save my Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I fail now, my people have lost forever. I must continue to rage on against this false light. But I can sense my demise coming soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To the soul who finds this journal, I say to you: the Jotun are the key to the Reian Tribe's survival. They are our journey, and they are our home.</p>
