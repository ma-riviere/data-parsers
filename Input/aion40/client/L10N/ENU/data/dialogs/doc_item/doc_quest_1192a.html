          <p> Reinforcement Request </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Krall are increasingly aggressive. They have wounded many of our best fighters and we scarcely have time between attacks to tend to our injuries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can barely hold the citadel, let alone go on the offensive against the Krall.</p>

          <p>Therefore, we have no choice but to request that Lavirintos dispatch more Guardians to the citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without reinforcements, we will surely fall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the glory of the Guardians!</p>
