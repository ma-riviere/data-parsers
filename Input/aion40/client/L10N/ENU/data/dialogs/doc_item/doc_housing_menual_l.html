          <p>- Entering Your Home -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get a Studio, you'll receive a tome that teaches the Homeward Bound skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This skill creates a portal through which you can enter your home no matter where you are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can also use the Studio Entrance in Arcada State to return to your Studio.</p>

          <p>- Building Maintenance Costs - </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Studios are completely free to live in, thanks to the generosity of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, if you decide to purchase your own detatched house, you will need to pay maintenance costs regularly.</p>

          <p>- Moving Out of a House - </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Purchasing your own home will, of course, cause you to lose ownership of your free Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, if you should then lose ownership of your detatched home, your Studio will become available once more. Speak to Parrine to reclaim it.</p>
