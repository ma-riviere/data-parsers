          <p>Entry 93 -- The Research Center Chairman said my research results were impressive, and that he would promote me to the Secret Laboratory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They finally approved my work! If things keep going this well, I might be able to advance my position in the Revolution more quickly than I anticipated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still , I can't stop wondering what are they studying in the Secret Laboratory? I must know!</p>

          <p>Entry 121 -- The Secret Laboratory was hidden behind the Rotron Experiment Lab in the northern part of the Research Center. Gatekeeper Kirrin was standing in front of the door looking fearsome.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It didn't take me long to realize that they won't let me in on everything, even though I work in the Secret Laboratory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems that there are many layers of secrecy here.</p>

          <p>Entry 140 -- They've given me access to the Bio Experiment Lab. It's behind a gate guarded by Karnifs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So far, they've performed experiments on Pretors and Mudthorns. They gave me a crystal with mysterious properties and ordered me to observe what effect it has on the Rotrons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My work here might take me some time. I'm not sure what the desired result is.</p>

          <p>Entry 146 -- According to rumor, there's only supposed to be one lab beyond this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is called Ormenon's Room, and two doors lead off it. Few people have access to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What kind of research warrants such high security? I worry that my curiosity may lead to trouble, but it's in my nature. It's the whole reason I became a researcher in the first place--to find things out!</p>

          <p>Entry 159 -- I made friends with a researcher named Nargis who used to work in the Mudthorn Laboratory and was recently posted here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hasn't had much difficulty adjusting, but I think he's as curious as I am about the secret research in Ormenon's Room. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least now I have someone I can talk to about it. Quietly.</p>

          <p>Entry 165 -- Something is going on with the senior researchers. I don't know exactly what the problem is, but they look concerned. They gather in twos and threes, and abruptly stop talking when we get close.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard more than one of them say "RM-78c," though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It sounds like one of the code-names we give to synthesized substances. I asked Nargis about it, and he's never heard of it before. I wonder what has them all so worried.</p>

          <p>Entry 168 -- Looking back over this journal it seems obvious that I should have been more worried. I feel like I've been misled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They said that Lord Lephar would become an Empyrean Lord, and put an end to all the chaos in Atreia. Only, I recently got some time off and managed to get outside for the first time in ages, and the world seemed more chaotic than ever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Rotrons are still terrorizing people. I believed that my research would help others, but I'm starting to think I was wrong.</p>

          <p>Entry 173 -- I contrived to overhear a conversation between the Research Center Chairman and the senior researchers. I told Nargis what they said, and he was as shocked as I.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to get away from the Lepharists as quickly as possible. RM-78c isn't a synthesized chemical at all--it's a monster!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Revolution I dreamed of is not what the Lepharists stand for. Everything I've done for the Revolution for the last ten years...it's all been in vain.</p>
