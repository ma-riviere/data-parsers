          <p>I recommend to you, Chatia, the aforementioned Daeva: a servant of the Empyrean Lord Nezekan, and a veteran of many battles even before ascension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With your wisdom, and with your tutelage, [%username] will undoubtedly grow into a most distinguished and powerful Daeva. I have failed to keep up with their pace, and kindly ask that you take the reigns, and help mold [%username] into a weapon for all Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Nezekan's justice be with you,</p>
          <p> </p>
