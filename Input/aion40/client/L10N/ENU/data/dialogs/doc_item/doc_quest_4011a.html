          <p>It's been a while, Kaindal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How have you been? Things have only gotten worse here since you left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We sowed new seeds, but fewer than half of them sprouted. Even those seedlings are withering now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what to do. We don't have any grain stored.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often think that I should have gone with you when you left. Well, it's too late for regrets now.</p>

          <p>They say you settled in a place called Ishalgen, is that right? I've never heard of such a place. I can't even guess where it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I am sure that it must be better than here, for a wanderer like you to settle down there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does it have much farmland? Are the locals kind? With it being so difficult to scratch out a living here, I often find myself contemplating Ishalgen.... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to know more about the place. At least I know it couldn't be worse than here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be waiting for your reply. </p>
