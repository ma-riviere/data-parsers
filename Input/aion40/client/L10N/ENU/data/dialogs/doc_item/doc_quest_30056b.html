          <p>Dear Telemachus,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure how to say these things, but I need to try.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whether it's from guilt, love, or obsession, I just can't rest easy until I apologize for the way things ended between us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was a coward. I'm sorry.</p>

          <p>I do not regret the decision I made--not any more--but I do regret the way I made it, my reasons for doing so, and.... Most of all, I regret the way I treated you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The honest truth is, I was afraid. You looked so much younger than I, and things would be that way forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I couldn't bear what people might think.</p>

          <p>Gellius has been good to me; I want you to know that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went to him because of cowardice, and he to me because of jealous rivalry, but we came to love each other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He seems arrogant and taciturn to others, but he treats me with all the tenderness and respect I could ever wish for. I hope it makes things easier for you, knowing that.</p>

          <p>I know I can never expect your forgiveness, so now I wish to forget everything that happened between us. I can't bear the thought of your anger and resentment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should do the same. I hope you haven't spent any time over the years pining for the cold-hearted, cowardly woman who ran from you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Ariel bless you, and bring you the happiness I could not.</p>
