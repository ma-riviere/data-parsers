          <p>No? You are fortunate in a way. I have a daughter, my only child. Her name is Orlan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I love her dearly. When I ascended I was happy that I would be able to protect her from harm, but I was wrong.</p>

          <p>Orlan has one wish--to bathe in a hot spring. Sadly, she is too weak to leave home, and of course the Lepharist Revolutionaries are all around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_D3].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could never fight my way through them and return. But you could. Would you please bring me water from the hot springs?</p>
