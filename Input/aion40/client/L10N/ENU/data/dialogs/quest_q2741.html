          <p>I was barely in Reshanta long enough to wave at my Uncle Jebal when I was dispatched to guard this crazy Priest Ganglot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, I am a little nervous. I mean, shards! Look at all those Undead. I can't let my guard down for a minute!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Priest seemed pretty confident at first, but now he's shaking like a leaf, and sometimes he talks to no one I can see....</p>

          <p>No. We're overwhelmed by the vast number of Undead wandering about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't think of any solution except to keep fighting, but how am I to kill the dead? The Priest says killing them is not a permanent solution--he ordered me to protect him from immediate harm and leave the rest alone so he can exorcise them, but I also have to guard him against the Elyos. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I'd listened to my mother and stayed close to Uncle Jebal!</p>

          <p>Well, the biggest headache is the Soul Reapers. Whenever the priest begins an exorcism, the Soul Reapers appear out of nowhere and attack, hindering his work. I defeated them when I could, but there are just so many!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot hunt them down because that leaves Priest Ganglot open to assault by the sun-poxed Ellies.</p>

          <p>I know you'll live up to your vow [%username], but I need the evidence to report to my superiors. Hopefully Uncle Jebal--I mean, the Brigade General--will send reinforcements when he knows what we're up against. I'm counting on you.</p>
