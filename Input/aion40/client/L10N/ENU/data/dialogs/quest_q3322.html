         <p>Oh, arieluma, [%userclass]. It gets so dull around here guarding the gate that I've taken up sculpting.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>I was just brainstorming ideas for my next piece. I'm going to call it 'glittering ennui'. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Since I've taken up sculpting, everything looks different. A flower, a rock, a Monitor dropping...I see them all, pulsing with life. I want to take that life essence and make it visible for all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you could help me out here. I can't leave the gate, but I'm running out of supplies for my art...and I simply must create! </p>

          <p>You're a gem!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sculpture I have in mind is simply screaming for [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3322a]. It's a tricky medium to work with, but it's incredibly strong and holds a wicked shine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go to the Ruberein Wastes or the Outpost Ruins you'll find plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Baku_25_An]s to hunt. Yes, some good solid Baku Horn with Lazuli insets...</p>

          <p>Sculpting has been such a boon for me. I even enjoy my work more now. The silence of guard duty gives me time to contemplate artistic ventures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And having something to think about keeps me from falling asleep at my post. Which is bound to help my career advancement prospects.</p>
