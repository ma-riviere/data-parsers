          <p>Here, [%username]. I need to talk to you about the Tursin tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're are a fairly minor tribe as far as the Krall go, but the Krall are never pushovers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur knew that, which is why they decided to use the Krall rather than exterminate them back before the Cataclysm. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if they're still serving the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Ah, right--your memory. I'll put it this way, [%username]. Some say the Asmodians are the greatest threat to our way of life. Others say those people just haven't met a Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't seen one myself, to be honest. But I know people with family members who've ascended and fought in the Abyss. Apparently, the Balaur don't leave many survivors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, let's focus on the immediate threat and put a stop to the Kobolds' attempts to extract [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA13].</p>

          <p>Our scouts tell us the Kobolds have been boiling something in a cauldron--probably experimenting with the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA19]. It's imperative we learn what they're planning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Infiltrate the Kobold compound, steal a sample from that cauldron, and take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12] out on [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA06]; he's the only one with the expertise to analyze the substance.</p>
