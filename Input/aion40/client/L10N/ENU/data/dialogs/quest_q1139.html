          <p>I remember when these hills were peaceful. I looked forward to a day of gathering and even brought the children sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These days we can't go far and we never go alone. Worgs only leave what they can't eat, and they can eat most things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole balance of the forest is off.</p>

          <p>The Frillnecks and Togs used to stay deep in the forest. The Worgs would skulk in the fringes. You'd see their eyes shining, but they rarely came up to the road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the Frillneck population exploded. They drove the Togs out, which then went swarming through the Worgs' territory, so the Worgs were forced out into the open. This is their territory now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not evil--they're just starving animals--but that doesn't make it any easier for me to safely gather herbs. I can't bear it, Daeva. Would you please do something about it?</p>
