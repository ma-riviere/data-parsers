          <p>(Folding the letter she was reading) Arieluma, Daeva. I just received an official letter from the Union Manager of the Manastone Removers Association.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems our attempt at unionizing some Shulack manastone locators ended terribly, so we're falling behind in our monthly quota.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any chance I could hire you to find me some old manastones that I need? I'll pay you with a bundle of glorious semi-new manastones in return.</p>

          <p>Let's see...the M.R.A. needs exactly 10 of each of these manastones: MP +60, Evasion +12, and Parry +20.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're pretty common, so it shouldn't be too hard. You might even have some in your cube or warehouse. Take a look and see...I'll wait.</p>

          <p>I know, I know...It doesn't seem like the Elyos thing to do to sell our old manastones to any buyer with the right amount of Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, trust me! They're not that good. Most are worthless. If they end up in the wrong hands it's not that terrible. Most of these old manastones get about two uses before they burn out.</p>

          <p>And that's just...between us two Daevas, all right?</p>
