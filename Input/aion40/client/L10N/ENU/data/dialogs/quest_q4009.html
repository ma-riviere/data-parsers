          <p>This is how we live around here. Barely any food, sleeping on dirt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Haven't lived this rough since I was a kid! I'm strong. I get by. The weak don't last long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, a good diet helps. Not that there's one to be had around here unfortunately. There is some good stuff, but you have to work to find it.</p>

          <p>Well, a balanced diet. With the filthy air here you need extra nourishment. Fortunately, I found Fine-haired Larvae around here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're a delicacy back home. No, really! Creepy looking, but so tasty! Tangy. And good for you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They live on Horto and Rabano leaves. Lucky those both grow here.</p>

          <p>Pandaemonium's inspectors were interested. Little guys don't even notice the pollution!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Course now they want [%dic:STR_DIC_DGmaterial_d_q_25a] samples for research and cultivation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Couldn't say no to high officials, but I should've. If I try getting the numbers they need, the Waste'll chew me up! Say...want some Kinah?</p>
