          <p>I can't believe it! We were so happy, jubilant even, after taking the Fortress from the Balaur! There was drinking and singing and music and dancing...and then...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then we found it, a portal to a hidden chamber. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up3_Crotan_SZ_All].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's brimming with Balaur right under our very feet!</p>

          <p>Yes, but we've blocked the portal off with our own magic. I just hope it'll last long enough.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're looking for strong Daevas who are willing to head into the chamber and fight the Balaur there. The work is incredibly risky, but there are also treasures down there to make even the wealthiest of Sanctum's nobles look like veritable paupers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you help, [%username]? We'd need all the Balaur killed, including their leader, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Crotan_DrakanNamed_45_Ah].</p>

          <p>I'm glad you've agreed to help. I should give you a quick tip if you're looking to bring back treasure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is...the Balaur will know as soon as you enter the chamber and will immediately start hiding the artifacts and trinkets they have. You'll have to dispatch them with great speed if you want to get rich.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now hurry--you can enter the chamber by walking through the door near me. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>Thank Ariel! Your destiny brought you to us, just as mine brought me here. Perhaps now I can be grateful for my role out here.</p>

          <p>Dirandera needed someone to enter the Krotan Chamber and rid the area of the remaining Balaur warriors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You completed the task, and your return you were rewarded for your troubles. Dirandera also mentioned that it was likely that more work would be needed to be carried out, and asked to you help out again if you were able.</p>
