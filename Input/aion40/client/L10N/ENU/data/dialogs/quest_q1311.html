          <p>Actually, I have a better idea. Phomona has always preferred practical results to theoretical solutions, and at the moment I have only the latter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have been working with these seeds, and with just a sprinkling of water from the mystic springs already I see promising results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I have not been able to plant the seeds properly.</p>

        	<p>On my last trip out here, I collected soil samples from the desert and watered them with spring water. They should now be ready for the seeds.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>But now when I enter the forest, I get attacked by Frillnecks. I'm no fighter, and it's only by Nezekan's grace I still have a life to call my own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The seeds must be planted soon. If they do not grow in the vanishing forest, they certainly will not grow in the barren desert.</p>

          <p>Yes, the Frillnecks should be much easier for you to handle. That is a much better idea than having me go out there again.</p>

          <p>A breakthrough! After so long...finally it has come! Thank the Five! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my work is not yet done! Improvements can still be made, the process refined, and of course the seeds must be tested in the actual desert!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is just the first step restoring the forests of Eltnen. The first step of many, but at last...it has been made. </p>
