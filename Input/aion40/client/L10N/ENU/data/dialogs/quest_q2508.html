          <p>I have a fair amount of expertise when it comes to minerals and jewelry, but I certainly don't have all the information. No one does, in fact, except the Shugos.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Anyhow, we need their help to get the information we need, but they aren't exactly known for volunteering their secret information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'll usually respond to large quantities of Kinah, but we don't have much to offer. But Priest Svera gave me an idea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, the only thing Shugos like more than Kinah is something called Shugo Grass.</p>

          <p>I know, it's hard to believe. Apparently it restores their health very quickly when they're worn out, and induces euphoria when they're already healthy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've never seen it, but Svera said she'd find some for me, and recently she sent me a message that she had some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The trouble is, I can't get it from Svera because I'm loaded down with missions. Do you think you could go for me, [%username]? I would appreciate it so much.</p>

          <p>Great. You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Svera] at the Black Plains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be extra helpful if you could deliver the Shugo Grass straight to the Shugos of the Kidorun Grave Robber Band.</p>

          <p>Horu couldn't go to Svera because he had too many missions, so you went to Svera for him.</p>
