          <p>Years ago when I ascended, my father gave me a fine sword as a present. However, it was far too fancy to be of any practical use. I entrusted the sword to Keruthis, the appearance modifier, to use as a model for reshaping.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I got stationed here, Arnkell, the weaponsmith made me this Flame Sword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To honor my father's gift, I'd like to reshape the Flame Sword into the pattern of my father's sword. But I'll need a your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>I'm glad to see you here. You must be here to modify its appearance. Performance isn't everything about a weapon, you know.</p>

          <p>The Sword of Silver Quartz Asgeirr entrusted to me is a beautiful item. I will probably never see its like again.</p>

          <p>Just to look at it...Asgeirr will now be able to honor his father's gift every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you should modify the appearance of your own weapon. There are many patterns that look better than the one you're using now.</p>

          <p>It may be too fancy for an Archon Sentinel, but this is what my father wanted.</p>
