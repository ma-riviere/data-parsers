          <p>Our paths have brought us both here, [%username]. You have risen through the ranks faster than most, with deadly strength and an unbending will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Morheim is your latest theater of war, and I now need your abilities. I have been sent here to investigate the missing Daevas, but my progress is being greatly hindered.</p>

          <p>By many things. The falling volcanic ash makes tracing tracks almost impossible, the extreme weather conditions cripple our endurance levels, and of course, the creatures!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can do nothing about either the weather or the volcanic ash, but I've had enough of the creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sanctioning a full cull of the most interfering species. Embla and I are both too busy, and Gangleri disappears whenever he pleases. I need more support.</p>

          <p>Yes. It will be a lot of work, so I'll need as many skilled fighters as I can find. You would do perfectly, if you would be willing to help, of course.</p>

          <p>They're all in the Mt. Musphel region, so should be easy enough to find. Come back only when all the quotas have been filled.</p>
