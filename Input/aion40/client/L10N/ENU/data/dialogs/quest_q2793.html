          <p>Have you ever seen a Dredgion, the Balaur Battleship? They're the most terrifying and devastating thing in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They come out of nowhere like something out of a nightmare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our usual defense strategies aren't working, and fighting them only increases our casualties.</p>

          <p>Abyss researcher Grunn says if we can acquire parts of a Dredgion for him, he'll analyze them for us, but that's much easier said than done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Dredgion did crash recently, though, and there's a lot of debris around the Crash Site.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This could be a perfect opportunity to look through the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_Module_Q1793]s for salvage. Do you think you could retrieve some?</p>

          <p>Excellent! I understand that Pandaemonium is following the situation closely, so this could be a career a boost, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Collect at least five pieces of Dredgion Salvage from the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_Module_Q1793]s, so Grunn has enough to analyze.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And of course the surrounding area is probably crawling with the Balaur who were inside the ship. Just so you know.</p>

          <p>Did you get Dredgion Salvage from the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_Module_Q1793]s? Grunn has been quite eager to see them.</p>

          <p>So this is salvage from the Dredgion Parts?</p>

          <p>They're not metal, nor wood, nor leather...and they feel so...unpleasant.</p>

          <p>I'll send them immediately. Grunn will be excited to see them.</p>
