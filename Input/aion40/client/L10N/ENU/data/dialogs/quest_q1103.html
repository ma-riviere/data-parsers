          <p>We've knocked the Kerubs down a few notches, but a lot of the grain that had already been harvested has gone missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kerubs are stealing it, [%username]. It seems they're not quite as stupid as they look.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The villagers need it back. They're facing a tough harvest as it is--they have to gather enough crops for their own stocks on top of the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA20] they need to send to [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07].</p>

	        <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Polinia, the one who hired us, is threatening to withhold payment until the sacks are returned to the villagers. I don't know where she learned smarts like that, but it certainly wasn't priest school.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you help? I know you just fought those Kerubs, but the faster we get those sacks back, the faster we get paid.</p>

          <p>Great. Gather up three [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA69]s from the Kerub dens around here. There's one up on that hill--might be a good place to start.</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>If you don't see any there, there are other dens nearby.</p>
