          <p>Arieluma, young Daeva. How does this old woman look? Like she's ready to meet her father for the first time?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so nervous.... I just want to look my best for him. I want him to be proud of me. Do you think he'll be proud of me?</p>

          <p>Oh dear, they say old women shouldn't use the teleporter... They say it's too dangerous. The old bones can't handle a jump like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I must get to Sanctum to see my father! I can't make a journey like that on my own two feet! I begged and begged the teleporter Daeva to let me go, but he wouldn't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you straighten this out for me? Maybe if you come with me to Sanctum, they'll let me take passage there. Tell them you're my grandchild....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Arrange for the both of us to go to Sanctum, and then when we're there you can help me find my father. You're such a nice young Daeva for helping an old woman like me.</p>
