          <p>Hail Daeva! A moment ago I received a message from Sinjah who is carrying out a scouting mission in the Krakon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She requests reinforcement as she has just three troops to scout and guard the bind point. She specifically asked for Mokkurkalfi, an ex-Legionary. Sinjah wants him to provide back up for her troops.</p>

          <p>Once, Mokkurkalfi was the best of the Legionaries. Single-handedly he could take out five or six Elyos and never leave a trace. Not only was he excellent in combat but he was also our top scout and assassin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, he was...ahem...difficult. He kept starting fights with other Legionaries--eventually he left the legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since he went rogue, he has been wandering alone in Reshanta, assassinating major Elyos. He's become their personal bogeyman. [%username], would you try to find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mokkurkalfi] and persuade him to help Sinjah out?</p>

          <p>Thank you. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mokkurkalfi] was last seen on Solitary Island to the southwest of the Primum Landing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please try to convince him to help us for old time's sake. Sinjah was one of the few who kept on good terms with him. Mention her, and Mokkurkalfi just may agree to help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Report back to Sinjah. If you fail to persuade Mokkurkalfi, she may need your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>Ahh, I expected as much.... Mokkurkalfi has never been suited to military life, but I hoped he'd reconsider if both the Brigade General and I asked him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least he's open to helping me. There's some hope in that. Thank you for trying.</p>

          <p>Hisui, the Red Hasia Brigade General said that Sinjah asked for reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Hisui had no reserves to send. So Hisui asked you to persuade Mokkurkalfi to return to the legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mokkurkalfi, who is an excellent fighter but also a misfit, flatly refused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sinjah was disappointed but heartened that Mokkurkalfi promised to help her personally.</p>
