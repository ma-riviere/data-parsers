          <p>Have you ever seen anything like this? It was found by a scout in Reshanta--he didn't know what it was either, but it looks important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It looks like a shard--transparent, thin, and smooth--like a piece of Aether or a crystal. But by Azphel, I have no idea what it is.</p>

          <p>That's what he said.... Just look at these elaborate carvings. I've never seen anything like it.</p>

          <p>I've heard that Abyss layer teleporters use Aether Gems in their teleportation.</p>

          <p>If you have time, [%username], would you visit the teleporters and see if this shardling belongs to one of them?</p>

          <p>Thank you Daeva. I think an object like this should be returned to its owner--I get the feeling it is missed.</p>

          <p>Try [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Feroniad] first--he's in the Western Shard of Latesran. If it doesn't belong to him, then he may know who lost it.</p>

          <p>In Atreia, Humans handle flight and teleportation, but in the Abyss, a Daeva must take the job. All this free-flowing Aether makes it a delicate operation--someone could end up inside a rock rather than on it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if a Human was able to control the Aether here, they'd not be up to moving so many Daeva around--the teleport traffic between the layers is unbelievable! I'm working faster than a Mau with a Karnif on his tail!</p>

          <p>Hmm, no, I've never seen anything like this. Some teleporters use Aether Gems to control the power flow, but my superior mental abilities make that unnecessary. As for this, it doesn't look like the sort of Aether Gems the others use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm...you know, just in case, show it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Liudona] in the upper layer. If she lost it, we'll all be in trouble. Riudona needs all the help she can get, if you know what I mean.</p>
