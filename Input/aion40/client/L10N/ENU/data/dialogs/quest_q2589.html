          <p>Ah, [%username]! I'm so glad to see you. I was just looking for a Daeva who could help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received a message that Pandaemonium will be dispatching inspectors to the Anair Harbor. They want to know if they can repair the facility for military purposes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe the senior officers realized the situation here is more serious than they thought? </p>

          <p>They might send a proper Legion here if the harbor facilities could be used, and it'd sure be nice to have the resources of a full legion here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, they want me to gather Daevas in the area and get some preparatory work done. It involves destroying the spirits wandering in the area so the inspection can proceed quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an official duty so I've been authorized to reward you with gold coins. Are you interested? </p>

          <p>Then please destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkFiD_41_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkWiD_41_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkRaD_40_An]s around Anair Harbor.</p>

          <p>Yes, if you already have something to do then you should finish that task first.</p>

          <p>I figure the contamination is the reason this area is crawling with so many ghosts. Even if they weren't exposed directly, they could have been affected through the air and soil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing else can explain why the harbor and even the forest would be filled with so many ghosts.</p>
          <p> </p>
