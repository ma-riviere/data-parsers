          <p>For some, the future's hearth is warm, surrounded by familiar faces. For you, though...I see hardship and danger. There is...some hope, but it's difficult to see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Intuition is a double-edged sword. Why see the future if you can't do anything about it? I'd far rather be out in the Abyss, tearing through Elyos feathers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're a Daeva now, and like the rest of us, you must walk your path, no matter how rocky it becomes.</p>

          <p>I can only tell you what I have seen. There is someone who may be able to help, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Destiny is a shrewd merchant, but like all merchants, its palm can be greased. You should seek out [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agamo], Daeva of Music. He's the source of most of the grease in this city, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But his talent is undeniable. With his songs, he might be able to call upon the divine power needed to sway your fortunes.</p>

          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agamo] by the pond in Pandaemonium Plaza. He likes to gaze into its waters, though what he sees beyond his own reflection I couldn't say!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ask him to sing the song of blessing for you. It shouldn't take too much persuading. If you do receive it, it may improve your luck.</p>

          <p>Ah, well met.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're hoping for one of my famous songs, I'm afraid you're out of luck. People have come to treat my talent as a hammer for all nails. It's unthinkable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My songs have been empowered by the Shedim Lords themselves. To use them wantonly would be...a crime against Asmodae!</p>
