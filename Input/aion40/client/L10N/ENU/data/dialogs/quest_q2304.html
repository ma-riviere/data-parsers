          <p>Tayga are especially fierce and growing bolder. One entered the Fortress just the other night and gave Hapenill the fright of her life...Blast, that girl can scream.</p>

          <p>The Worgs help keep them back from the Fortress, but I can't be everywhere at once. And it would be easier to winnow down the Tayga in the Snow Field and keep them from approaching the Fortress at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad we're all so overworked here. Maybe you could hunt some of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DireBeastD_21_An] for me, [%username]? If they appear near the fortress again we'll have a full blown panic on our hands!</p>
