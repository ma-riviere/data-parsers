          <p>I understand the importance of my job. Without supplies, our troops can't act against Tiamat and the rest of the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still.... I never feel like this is what I am meant to do. I miss flying. I miss the freedom of the skies, the feel of cloud wisps against my skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe I can return someday... But it seems that won't happen until this war is over.</p>
