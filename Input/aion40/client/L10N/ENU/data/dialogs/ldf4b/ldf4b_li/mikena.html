          <p>So this is one of Tiamat's Hearts. To be honest, I expected more. Grander, more threatening.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to think we're so close to fighting a Dragon Lord.... Tiamat must be furious that we have taken her fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even then, there are four more to fight. I don't know whether to be frightened or excited.</p>
