          <p>Watching the Heart of Fissure is a grim duty. But it does have one perk: it generally keeps me away from the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've met many Elyos in Kamar, and every one has been condescending, arrogant, and haughty, treating Reians like children or servants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll fight alongside them to see Tiamat fall, but I won't like it, not for a second.</p>
