          <p>Wondering what these things we're building are? They're Trebuchets, meant to, ah, "deliver" very explosive cargo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The craftsmen working on them are extremely talented. I'm always impressed at what they can do, and so quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat is going into a defensive stance here. We're hoping that the Trebuchets will allow us to counter her strategy.</p>
