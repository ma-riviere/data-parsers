          <p>Some see me as an oddball when I say I was overjoyed to come to Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's true. I'm in the home of the Dragon Lord, now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means that we're strong, and we're close to Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm naturally delighted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, when Tiamat is finally defeated, I'll probably burst into tears. </p>
