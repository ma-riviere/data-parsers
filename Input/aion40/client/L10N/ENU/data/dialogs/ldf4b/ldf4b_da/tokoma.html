          <p>I'm a veteran of several Gelkmaros campaigns. I've even been to Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've never felt as tense as I have here. Between Tiamat, the lack of Aether, and the Elyos, it's hard not to be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It makes me miss Asmodae, you know what I mean? Though that reminds me just why I'm here, and what I'm fighting for.</p>
