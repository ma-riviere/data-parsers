		<p>More Coin rewards to hand out? Lady Triniel's scythe is sharp today.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I have several rewards that you can choose from, [%username]. Each has its cost though, so you should make certain you have the right number of Platinum Coins before you try to claim your prize.</p>

		<p>Today you can choose from a fabled weapon, a heroic weapon, fabled armor, or heroic armor.</p>

		<p>It costs 1000 Platinum Coins, a figure most Daevas can only dream of.</p>

		<p>My word! You actually collected 2000 Coins?! I was so used to the rigmarole of naming the prices that I never expected someone to actually claim a Fabled Weapon.</p>

		<p>Well here it is. This blade can cut through metals and stone as though it was guided by Zikel's own hand. Treat it well, [%username], and it well never let you down.</p>
