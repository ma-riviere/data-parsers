          <p>Ascension deserves great praise but also demands caution, Daeva. The trials that await you will not be easy. Determination and ability must be combined in equal measure if you are to meet with success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can see that this does not surprise you. Your eyes show a resolve beyond your newly ascended status.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have met many new Daevas, each as inexperienced and uncertain as the next, yet you carry yourself differently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am seldom mistaken about these things.</p>

          <p>Though my knowledge of the Abyss is limited, even I have heard about the Balaur massing in Karamatis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But never of a battle against them there. To emerge from combat as fierce as that which you have described seems...incredible.</p>

          <p>A Daeva who has lost power and memory, re-rendered into Human form--it's unheard of. I must consult Jucleas to discern the truth of it before we can discuss this further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I said that grave danger lies ahead--this is the path of the Daeva. Whatever Pernos showed you, for now you must focus on the task at hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Verteron Citadel needs assistance, but before you, there was no one to send. Go quickly.</p>

          <p>Excellent! All our lives are entwined in fate. As Daevas, we play a crucial role in the coming struggles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Verteron is taking heavy losses against the Tursin Krall. We also hear a group resembling the Lepharist Revolutionaries is active in the area.</p>
