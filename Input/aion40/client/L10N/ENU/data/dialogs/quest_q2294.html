		<p>You got iron coins?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>There are two types of items: some sell for two coins and some for four coins.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>How many coins do you have for me? The more expensive rewards are, of course, the better ones.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>My wares are designed for swordsmen and bowmen. In other words, Gladiators, Templars, Rangers, and Assassins.</p>

		<p>Check your cube again, maybe they're hiding under something.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Otherwise, you can carry out missions to receive more coins.</p>
