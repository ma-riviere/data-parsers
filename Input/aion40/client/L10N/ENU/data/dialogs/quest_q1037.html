          <p>One of the Golden Bough Legion's main objectives here in Eltnen is to explore the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_C3].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is still a mystery how our ancestors managed to build such an enormous temple underground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And we're uncertain about its purpose: which Seraphim Lord--oh, Empyrean Lord, I mean--it was dedicated to.</p>

          <p>Because it's so old, much of the Eracus Temple Cavern has disintegrated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Axelion here is in charge of the restoration effort. If all goes well, we'll learn a lot about our ancient ancestors. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Eltnen is a dangerous place, and our ranks are already depleted. Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Axelion] if you want work--I'm sure he can use capable hands.  </p>

          <p>I told Brigade General Castor I needed quality help. And if you're here, [%username], then Castor delivered.</p>

          <p>I need your help uncovering a few secrets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are several walls in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_C3] that have various patterns on them. But they're so heavily damaged that I can't determine their original meaning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can somehow restore the walls, I would be able to examine the engravings and perhaps work out which Empyrean Lord the temple was constructed for.</p>

          <p>There are six spiral towers of different heights in the Eracus Temple Cavern. In the center is the highest and largest tower, and the remaining five towers are arranged in a circle around it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each of the five smaller towers are patterned with unique engravings. The walls are badly damaged, but the fragments that should be lying nearby are nowhere to be found.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My current theory is that the indigenous creatures nearby took away the pieces we need.</p>

          <p>I already found the piece that fits the Flower Wall--the first spiral tower.</p>

          <p>Yeah, you have to restore them in a specific order: First, restore the Flower Wall, then go to the other walls in this order: Lightning, Wave, Wind, and Fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The damaged sections are all on the upper sections of the towers. They're all slightly darker than the other panels, so should be easy enough to see.</p>
