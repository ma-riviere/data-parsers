          <p>Now that we have the key, we need someone to find the passage and infiltrate Adma Stronghold to see what it's like inside. Thanks to you we know it starts at Old Nahor Castle, but where in the castle is it, and is it still intact?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reconnaissance is not my unit's strong suit, but you seem to have a gift for it. Will you investigate this for us?</p>

          <p>Old Nahor Castle is in ruins now. It would have been difficult to find any secret passages even in Lord Lannok's time, but now it's going to be nearly impossible. Luckily, I may know someone who can help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Seiren by the name of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF2a_Seiren_Sahnu] has lived near Old Nahor Castle for years. If anyone knows where the passage is, she does. Of course, whether or not she'll tell you is another matter entirely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, do your best to find the passage and get into Adma Stronghold from there. Eliminate anything dangerous you find. When you're done, report your findings to elder Daeva Heintz.</p>

          <p>Lord Lannok took my home. He sang honeyed words to my sister, abused her, and then left her to die. I loathe him. If it will avenge her, I will help you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The passage still exists, but it is narrow, far too small for a creature of your size. I have an idea, however. Go to Alukina's Palace in Beluslan. There, hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater4D_45_Ae]s until you obtain a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2094a]. Bring it back to me, and I will tell you what you must do next.</p>

          <p>Sahnu used a Waterdrop of Spirit to create Ribbit Essence to help you get through the narrow passage.

You were forced to kill him, and when you did a strange seed-like object came out of his body.</p>
