          <p>It was Estino's fault! He just kept on and on at me until I couldn't take it anymore!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I couldn't just stand there and take it! So I...I...kind of let my mouth run away with me. Now I have to go to the Tursin Outpost or lose the stupid bet I made.</p>

          <p>Of course I can, but I can't leave my post! Especially for something so trivial as a personal score.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once, a sentry called Gaione fell asleep on his watch--the citadel was almost overrun. I won't have a story like that floating around about me.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>The best proof would be a pile of [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA82]s, so please gather some. The Krall keep them in supply crates all over their campsite. About eight of them should be enough to shut [%dic:STR_DIC_LA27] up. He's at the Ellun River Mouth. Tell him the Krall weapons are from me, and he's lost the bet. He'll give you the money he owes me and you can just keep it.</p>
