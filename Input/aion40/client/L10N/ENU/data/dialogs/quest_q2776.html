          <p>I hate writing these detailed reports even more than doing the research itself. Luckily Midori is responsible for providing the full report to Grunn. But she is rechecking every detail and recalculating every result. This could take days!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since I know Grunn is eagerly awaiting any information on the research we've done here, I'd like you to take him a preliminary summary.</p>

          <p>I am not sure that this is good news or bad news, but a Wardstone Crystal has no connection with a fragment of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it were a fragment of Aion, it would not be contaminated so easily. But there is good news--these crystals can be used in crafting weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is all I can report for sure now. I would appreciate it if you could deliver that message to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grunn].</p>

          <p>Thank you. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grunn] is on the 2nd floor of the Primum Fortress.</p>

          <p>Tell him that we will send a detailed report soon.</p>

          <p>That's interesting information. I am a little disappointed to hear that my hypothesis is wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is good to know that the crystal can be used in developing new weapons, though. I hope it will help us in the war.</p>
