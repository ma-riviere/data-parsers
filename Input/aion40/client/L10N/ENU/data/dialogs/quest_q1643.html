          <p>I've studied the Hazy Disks you brought from the Anubite Fighters. I just can't figure out what they are--but the shape engraved on them looks familiar. Where have I seen it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah--that's it! The Star of Heiron! It's the Ancient symbol of Jeiaparan Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's very old, though--the town hasn't used it in years.</p>

          <p>The star? I don't know--except that the fighter who kept this must have been tied to Jeiaparan Village somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The village priest could probably tell us more. Would you take this and show it to her?</p>

          <p>Okay, you know where Jeiaparan Village is, right? Look for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erato] and see what she can tell you about the symbol. It's my only lead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the more you can learn about the fighter who carried it--if you can learn anything at all--the better.</p>

          <p>Ah, this disk is the trace of binding. The Star of Heiron means this belonged to someone who had bound his soul to the Obelisk of this village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bind your soul to an Obelisk, the Aetheric energy inside you turns into a crystal that leaves this kind of trace.</p>

          <p>Did you say this was from an Anubite? Then I'll be able to call the spirit. The Obelisk knows every soul bound here. Follow me.</p>

          <p>Aion's light! Anubites were the Daevas Bollvig killed...and they resurrected at the Cursed Obelisk....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means the spirits and undead in The Storm Circle and at Nolantis were killed by Bollvig, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And somehow he bound them to his own obelisk. Hm...perhaps Liske can solve that mystery. Be blessed in the light, [%username].</p>

          <p>The Anubites are Daevas who were killed by Bollvig? Bollvig made the Cursed Obelisk...where he resurrected undead fighters that he could control?</p>
