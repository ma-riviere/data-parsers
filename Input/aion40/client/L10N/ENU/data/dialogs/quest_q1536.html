          <p>This observation post is dangerously isolated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure, it's close to Kishar Village and the IndratuÂ Barracks, but our supplies and reinforcements all come from Jeiaparan Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And when our Guardians take leave, Jeiaparan Village is the only place they can go...if they want to be back in time for their next shift.</p>

          <p>Sure, it's a quick trip if you cross the Black Tears Swamp and take the southern road of the Decayed Grove.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you've come that way recently, you know the problem: the southern road stinks--literally. It stinks worse than the swamp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've actually had patrols collapse on the road, overcome by the fumes. So far we've been lucky, but it's just a matter of time before the beasts in the grove--or the Krall--drag off our unconscious soldiers.</p>

          <p>Not always. It depends on the wind--and on how many Contaminated Spirits are wandering around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The swamp muck smells bad, but it's nothing compared to the toxic stench of the Spirits. I think it's because the Spirits are a condensed version of the contaminated soil that we find across all of Heiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
    			<p>If you eliminate those troublesome Spirits, [%username], I'll reward you handsomely. And you'll make the road safe for supplies and reinforcements.</p>

          <p>Thank the light! I was afraid that you might turn me down because the task is so...unsavory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So go wipe out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_34_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_35_An]s along the southern road of the Decayed Grove.</p>

          <p>We can get supplies down that road safely now, and without the fumes making us collapse.</p>

          <p>Brosia said that the Spirits on the road to Jeiaparan Village stink so much that travelers are collapsing on the road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you eliminated the Ruined Soil Spirits and Contaminated Terra Spirits, it pleased Brosia and improved morale at the observation post.</p>
