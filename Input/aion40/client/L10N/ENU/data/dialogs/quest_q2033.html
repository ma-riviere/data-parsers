          <p>Have you heard the tale of the Cursed Necklace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This necklace attracts amazing wealth, but as you get richer, you begin to lose family and friends until you're alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually, you lose your mind and meet quite a grisly end.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I trust you with this information, [%username], because I need your assistance. Someone must destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_2033b]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be easy--that's why I haven't done it myself, frankly. If I were to fail, the necklace would fall into the wrong hands. You are the first Daeva I've believed capable of doing it.</p>
