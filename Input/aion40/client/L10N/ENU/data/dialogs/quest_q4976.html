          <p>Did you see the public notice the other day? "Brusthonin welcomes new settlers as part of the Third Reconstruction Project," is what it said. As soon as I saw it, I knew it was for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure if you know this, but I'm the only one in my family who hasn't ascended as a Daeva. My parents raised me in Pandaemonium so that I wouldn't get hurt, not because I earned it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lately I feel I'm stuck somewhere I don't belong. It's like being in one of those crystal prisons. Safe, but trapped. If I never ascend, I'll die here without ever...feeling normal.</p>

          <p>I want to challenge myself, really. If I die I'll miss my chance, and if I ascend it won't be a challenge any more. So I'm thinking of starting a new life as a settler.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The notice said a settler has to be qualified, but it didn't say what the requirements are. I sent more than a few letters to the people in charge, but I haven't heard back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're on your way to Brusthonin, can you ask them if I qualify? It would mean a lot.</p>

          <p>Thank you! The notice said [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sridi], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Heintz], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phyper] are the people in charge. I guess you could ask any or all of them if I qualify.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they ask, I'm really quite good at tailoring, cooking, and playing music...and I can use a dagger! I'm no warrior, but I think I can handle myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, have a safe trip. Hurry back!</p>

          <p>Heltinjola? Of course, I remember her ridiculous letters. I threw them out.</p>

          <p>A settler needs farming skills, fighting skills, things like that. I think she said she could use a dagger? Who can't? Every Asmodian child learns to use a dagger. It's worthless in a place like this.</p>

          <p>Here's what you need to tell her--she needs to wake up and start thinking about marriage, not Brusthonin.</p>

          <p>You, on the other hand.... Are you sure you don't want to settle here? A Daeva would earn privileges the others don't get. Think about it?</p>

          <p>Heltinjola? Ah, the persistent one from Pandaemonium. I thought it was a prank, since she sent a letter every day. She was real?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm.... It's a pity. Persistence is a virtue, but aside from that she doesn't have any useful skills. A settler must be able to farm but she's never even seen a seed, much less sown one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please tell her to stop wasting paper on letters. The Elim will be cross with her.</p>
