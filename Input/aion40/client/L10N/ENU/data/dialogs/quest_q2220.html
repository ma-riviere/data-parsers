          <p>The seeds we have are good, but having just a few more would be best.</p>

          <p>It's only this farm that seems affected. But these MuMu, they're not from around here, are they?</p>

          <p>Frightcorn grows just about anywhere, but not like this. I think the seeds are being altered elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe if we get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_11_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_13_An]s you saw guarding the Frightcorn Fields, I could examine their stores more closely!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm ready to try if you are.</p>

          <p>Okay, here's the plan. You go up ahead and take out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_11_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_13_An]s, and I'll slip in behind you and gather the seeds.</p>

          <p>That way, we'll finally know what's going on.</p>

          <p>Of course, it would be better if we could get rid of all of them, but 5 should be a sufficient distraction to get the job done.</p>
