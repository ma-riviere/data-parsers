          <p>I'll never forget the day we fled our home. It was particularly foggy, and I'd had weird dreams the night before, so I told my family not to leave the house if they could help it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there was nothing to eat, so my darling husband went out to catch some Almehas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would have told him not to go, but there was little Rotenan to think of.</p>

          <p>It was getting dark, and my husband still wasn't home. Rotenan was sitting at the window, and my spirits soared when he said "Father is here! I see him!" and ran out the door.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hurriedly put some water to boil, but I heard a scream from outside. I ran out and saw an undead attacking Rotenan. I used my broom to separate them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank the Shedim Lords that the Watch heard our screams.</p>

          <p>When he came to his senses, Rotenan confirmed my fear that the undead who attacked him was his father. I guessed as much when he didn't return, but....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry...that was unbecoming of me. I didn't mean to speak of something so depressing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We owe so much to the Watch members, not just that incident, but for their continuing protection. I want to express my thanks to them.</p>

          <p>Well, do you see those Worn Kalgolems down there? It turns out that a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2572a] makes a very effective flint. It's so cold here, people need to start fires often. It isn't much, but I think it would be quite useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I'm asking your help. Could you hunt those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SouledStoneDreD_36_An]s for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would mean a lot to me to be able to do something for the Watch.</p>

          <p>I'll decorate them, of course, and put each one on a cord.</p>

          <p>You obtained the Fragments of Worn Kalgolems for her, so she could make them into gifts for the Watch.</p>
