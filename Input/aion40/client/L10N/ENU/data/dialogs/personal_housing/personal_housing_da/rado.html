          <p>What? I know where my Porguses are. They're not lost. They're just... sleeping. Somewhere else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'll be back any minute. Ha ha. Ha. It's totally fine. We do this all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I definitely did not lose them. What kind of shepherd would lose his Porguses? Ha ha.</p>
