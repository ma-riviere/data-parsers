          <p>We had one around here who insisted he was Zikel, Lord of Destruction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was harmless enough. He wasn't violent or obscene or anything, just weird.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll never guess what happened to him. He ascended. Ascended!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine what he's doing now as a Daeva, but it doesn't bode well for us if he's on the front lines against the Elyos, does it!</p>
