          <p>I used to live in the Vanahal District, but then, I fell in love with a Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my family is really conservative, and there were... other things... about the relationship they didn't approve of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It doesn't matter. I kept thinking things would work themselves out, but they never did. At least, not before my love died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the worst part of loving Humans is not that they die. It's that you're left with so many opportunities for regret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ever love a Human, don't hold yourself back.</p>
