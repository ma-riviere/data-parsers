          <p>Say, what comes to your mind when you watch the sunset? I see that golden hue and think of coins...loads and loads of glittering coins...flooding my sink, my countertop, my toilet... akakak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you can see how realistic that dream is. I'm a gardener. Nyerk, if I started growing flowers made of gold, I still won't make a single Kinah more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that golden hue sure is pretty...</p>
