          <p>Where do you live?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I work in the Vanahal District, but I live here. I own that big house up the hill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's preferable to living in Pandaemonium, I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much easier to get away from the rabble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have anything against the working class. I'm sure they're perfectly nice if you get to know them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just don't like listening to them screeching at each other all the drunken night.</p>
