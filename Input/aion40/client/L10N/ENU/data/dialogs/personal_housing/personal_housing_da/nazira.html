          <p>I've thought about studying Alchemy under the master here, like most people do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I just don't like Juliene.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm just teaching myself instead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I figure I'll keep going until I can't figure things out on my own anymore, and then, I'll go to her for help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll have to talk to her eventually, but I can delay it as long as possible.</p>
