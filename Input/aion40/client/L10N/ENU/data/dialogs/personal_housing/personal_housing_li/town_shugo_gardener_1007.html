        	<p>Welcome to Seapath Village, Daeva. This village has bigger gardens than most, so I have to work that much harder.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Doesn't bother me much though. Gardening reminds me of mother. She was a gardener too, and I took over job when she passed away.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Feel like I have connection to her still through these flowers, and maybe her spirit visits here sometimes.</p>
