          <p>The Village Improvement Society sent me to this town. They say that you can see fireflies all over the night sky here at Glimmertree Village, but I have yet to see a single one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I have to go into the forest to see them. If only there was time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No no. Too busy. Plant seeds, water seeds, fertilize plants. They they grow, die, and I have to do it all again. Nyerk!</p>
