          <p>When I grow up, I'm going to marry a shepherd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That way he'll be gone all day and I won't have to see him at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're going to live in a treehouse. Or a cave. I can't decide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Caves are super cool and have underground rivers and secrets and stuff, but if I live in a treehouse when my mom comes over I can pull up the ladder and she won't be able to get in!</p>
