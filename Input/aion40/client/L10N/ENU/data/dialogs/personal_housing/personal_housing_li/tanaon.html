          <p>This story will never get old.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, Fluria's spending time in Prosperity's Light Village, right? And she's leaning on a balcony, probably showing off her arm strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then she loses her balance and falls off! A Home Security specialist falling off a balcony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How does that even happen?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Awww, don't leave me behind, Fluria. You know I only tease because I care.</p>
