          <p>I can't stand it any more! "Go here, do that, kill those," AND babysit these villagers? Can't they help themselves? I was holding out for reassignment, but no matter what I do I'm stuck in this light-forgotten wasteland.</p>

          <p>Why is there never any less work? I never finish anything. If this keeps up, I'll be stuck here until I'm as bent and wrinkled as Hannet.</p>

          <p>I suppose, but now Administration Officer Agrips has given me new orders on top of the duties that Centurion Asclepius assigned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He wants me to hunt the Kerubians blocking the path to the Geroch Caldera so that the villagers can pass. Why me? Why not assign that to Arkel? It's because of that incident with the Gryphus, I just know it!</p>

          <p>Hmm.... Would you give me a hand? Catching just seven [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Cherubim2_35_n]s should satisfy the Administration Officer. Can you do that for me?</p>

          <p>My thanks. Now there will be less trouble on the way to the volcanic region.</p>
