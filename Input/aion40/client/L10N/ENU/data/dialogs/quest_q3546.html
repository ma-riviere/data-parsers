          <p>Greetings, [%username]. It seems the Manastone Removers Association has some competition out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A traveling caravan of Shugos have been selling used manastones just outside of the city limits...for cheap, too. So, the union is going to pay them a little visit one of these nights.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugos took a lot of my business, so my quota is way down. Any chance you could find me bundles of MP +50, Evasion +10, and Parry +18 manastones? 10 of each? There's a reward in it!</p>

          <p>Great to hear, [%username]! The union Regional Manager will bring holy Nezekan down on my hide if I don't reach my monthly quota.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't happen to have the manastones on you, do you? Maybe in your cube or warehouse?</p>

          <p>Why? I'll treat you well. I'll give you some of my best manastones as payment for your services.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I guess my luck had to run out some time. I'll be getting an ear-full from the manager this week.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>There's like...half the manastones we agreed upon here! I need 30 of them total, 10 of each kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're almost there. Union rules say I can't accept partial orders on this, so if you want this reward, I suggest you get back out there and finish this order!</p>

          <p>You've kept your promise, Daeva. And now I shall keep mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These manastones I'm giving you are some of the rarest you will find in all Heiron...at least legally. That's not to say those Shugos won't be bringing in a wagon-load of these soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But for now, they're as rare as you are going to find. Thank you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Atera said she needed more manastones to reach the Manastone Removers Association's quota. She offered to reward you with some powerful new manastones if you brought her the old ones she needed.</p>
