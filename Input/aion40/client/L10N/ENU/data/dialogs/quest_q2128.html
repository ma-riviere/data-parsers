          <p>You know, people would have you believe the Dundun were mindless dunces destined to do nothing more than farm their crops, breed, then croak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know better, though. There's more to them than meets the eye.</p>

          <p>You bet. See, as farmers they're top notch. I was a farmhand back in my youth, and let me tell you, Ginseng is not easy to grow. It requires constant monitoring and perfect conditions. And even then, the crops can fail for absolutely no reason.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, one day I find a dead Dundun out on the trail toward the Odella Plantation. Among his things, I found a pouch bustin' full with dried Ginseng! Literally spillin' out of his pockets! I've checked, and it looks as if all the Dundun carry [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2128a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm looking for someone to head up to the plantation and get some more for me. 'Course, those Dundun aren't likely to just hand it over, so you might have to crack a few skulls to get it. How about it?</p>
