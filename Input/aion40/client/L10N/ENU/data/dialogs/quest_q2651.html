          <p>Daeva....Can you spare a moment to listen to me? My fate seems intertwined with yours and I am anxious for your aid. If there had been no Observatory, I would have returned to the flow of Aether after I vanished, appreciating the grace of the Shedim Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I lived a long life, [%userclass]. There were many who were dear to me, almost all of whom have passed into the flow of Aether. I do not mourn them for I hope to join them one day. They were fine and brave, and it was my honor to have known them. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one, however, whom I cannot find. His spirit haunts my dreams and keeps me from my rest. I must know his fate.</p>

          <p>His name was Bollvig and we ascended at the same time. His fighting prowess was unequalled--I learned a lot from him--and yet the shade of his soul was such that everyone wished to shelter in it. He had a bright future ahead and I was very fond of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His nature was not that of leader or follower, though. He was called to a different, lonelier path. He was always wandering, unable to stay long in one place. </p>

          <p>I don't know. I heard that he went to Elysea to prove his mettle in the bosom of our enemies, but I was never able to discover if he returned. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I am called to the flow of Aether, but without knowing his fate, I am doomed to remain here. Please, [%username], will you not help set me free? </p>

          <p>Bollvig? I don't...ah, yes. I remember now. I believe he's still in Elysea, come to that. At least, if he ever came back I've heard nothing about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He and a few others set off to Elysea once to make a name for himself, but most of them came back. There's been a rumor that he fell in love with some Elyos peasant and lost his mind, but who can say? Last I heard, he was occupying one side of Heiron in Elysea and leading a force of Undead. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've dubbed his territory "The Storm Circle" or something suitably terrible like that. Elyos are so melodramatic. If you want to see for yourself, go to the Beluslan's Roof. There's a rift near the waterfall there that'll take you to The Storm Circle. Find an undead you can talk to and they should direct you to him. </p>
