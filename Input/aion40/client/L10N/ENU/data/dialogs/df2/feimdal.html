          <p>What does an Information Officer do, you ask? Well, I'm glad to tell you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We announce policies and news from Pandaemonium to the citizens. I take it quite seriously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course we also deliver the opinions of the citizens to the priest or the fortress commander. It's important for those in charge to understand how the citizens feel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most Information Officers move on to different jobs, though, because of the low pay.</p>

          <p>It is, but for me it's not a problem. I already own a Tripeed farm near Alsig village, which supports me fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I took this job to meet powerful people, and to understand the politics of government better. I may want to become a higher official someday....</p>
