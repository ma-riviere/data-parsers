          <p>The Wonderful World of Tripeeds</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tripeeds! These strange and wonderful vegetables have brought so much joy and nutrition to boys and girls the world over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their delightful dance captivates the hearts and imaginations of young and old alike.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet they aren't quite vegetables, are they? No siree! Tripeeds are something special all right!</p>

          <p>In fact, nobody really knows what to call Tripeeds! Some folks call them a plant, some folks call them an animal. Even the Daevas of Classification don’t know for sure! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your grandparents will probably argue with each other for days if you bring this up around them, so you'd better not mention it at all. Old people sure do like to argue sometimes!</p>

          <p>You may be shocked to hear this, but Tripeeds didn't always look like they do now! Thousands of years ago, their ancestors wandered around Morheim. Today, we call them Compound Tripeeds. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They weren't so popular back then, mainly because they liked to walk into folks' gardens and push the other vegetables right out! But a Daeva named Jamhandi decided to fix all that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before he was a Daeva, he was a gardener, and after centuries of watching those Compound Tripeeds have their way with his crops, he decided to breed them into something that'd stay in place most of the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that's why we call him the Daeva of Tripeeds!</p>

          <p>But Jamhandi didn't just breed Tripeeds to turn them into a crop. Oh no! He bred them as weapons to fight the Balaur in the Millennium War! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, Tripeed seeds are so full of life that if you heat them up just right, they'll get real excited and--POW!--explode! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So Jamhandi grew whole farms of Tripeeds to help build explosive traps that'd blow those Balaur into pulpy red chunks. Even today, folks still use Tripeed seeds to make deadly traps!</p>

          <p>If you want to grow your own Tripeeds--and who wouldn't--you have to go about it in just the right way! Tripeeds are finicky, and if they don't have things exactly the way they like it, they just won't grow. So here’s what Tripeeds like:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Temperature: Just hot enough that an honest hour's work gives you a nice, light sweat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Precipitation: Just enough rainfall to keep that fresh, clean smell of earth in the air, but not enough to make the ground muddy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soil: Just cold enough to make you shiver a little when you lie down on it without a blanket.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And there's only one place that has all those things: Alsig Village! Home of the world-famous Tripeeds! Yes, Tripeeds truly are Aion’s greatest blessing to Humanity.</p>
