          <p>Take a look at this Mist item, Daeva! Feel how light it is? That is because it is made with actual mist, made solid by secret magic, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is much stronger than almost any metal, and since we do not have to pay smith to work, we can sell for cheap!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since it is mist, it will dissolve after a certain time. Still, if you need power, Mist equipment is for you! Buy as much as you need!</p>
