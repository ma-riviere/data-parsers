          <p>We've been developing stronger wings for Daevas. A skillful Daeva can use them to fly rings around the Asmodians and the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But stronger wings aren't for everyone. Only those with superb concentration and total mastery of Aether can use them.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, [%username]. Lord Kaisinel seeks Daevas who meet the highest standards. I sent you a letter because you may be one of those Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the best wings in Atreia don't come cheap. The materials alone are staggeringly expensive. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you've got the skill to use the wings. When you've got the Kinah, come back to me and we'll get you fitted. </p>
