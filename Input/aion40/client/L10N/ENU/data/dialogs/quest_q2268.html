          <p>The supplies in those wagons are of vital importance. It's our duty to stop the attacks, but we also need to guard the Observatory. </p>

          <p>Neifenmer thinks it's the work of the Lepharists, but I've seen signs of Pecku.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lepharists are filthy robbers--they steal, but they don't tear things to pieces. The Pecku, however, are deadly birds with sharp talons. They tear everything to shreds!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When they attack, there's nothing left to salvage, not even the wagoneers.</p>

          <p>Whatever attacked those wagons was big. Really big...</p>

          <p>Neifenmer calls me crazy, but all things considered, I'm sure that those birds are the culprits. </p>

          <p>Please go down to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_27] and hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CockatriceD_17_An]. If the attacks stop after you've killed those blasted birds, then I'll be proved right!</p>
