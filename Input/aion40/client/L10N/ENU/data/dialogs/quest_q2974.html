          <p>Right. Make me Kinterun's Noble Breastplate. Oh, it takes more than blasted talent to be the best! You need grit and passion as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But unless the fumes have finally rotted my brain, you have 'em.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One warning, though. If you're studying to be a bloody Armorsmithing Expert, you work at it till you're done. All the other crafts can wait. And then, you get one more. One. Clear?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a right slog, but afterward? It'll be useful, beautiful, and fit to last the bloody ages!</p>
