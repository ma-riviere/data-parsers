          <p>The villagers spend less time bothering me now, but things are still far from good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's those sun-blighted undead. They're everywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I spoke to a priest who's a bit of an expert, and he told me why there are more undead rather than fewer, in spite of our efforts.</p>

          <p>According to him, an undead creature's energies seep into its possessions and binds part of its spirit to the objects, allowing it to resurrect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we kill them and kill them, and they're using their own blasted possessions as obelisks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So this time [%username], when we destroy the undead in Besfer Ghost Village, we're going to finish the job. Can I count on you?</p>
