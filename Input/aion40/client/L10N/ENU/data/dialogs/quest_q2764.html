          <p>They say I became a Daeva through sheer willpower. Now I've finally reached Reshanta and it's swarming with Balaur, but I still haven't had my chance for revenge!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Grabakr's escort, I'm almost in sight of their camps on Sword's Edge, but can I go there? No! I've got to guard a scholar! In the middle of nowhere. See any Elyos? I don't think so. But you want to bet what'd happen if I stepped out?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, this is killing me. I'm begging you...put those scalies out of my misery?</p>

          <p>Aion, what a relief! Okay, Dakaer Balaur Legion are stationed on the Sword's Edge in the south. Squads are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_LizardmanFi_33_An]s,  [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_LizardmanAs_33_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_LizardmanRa_33_An]s, and a few from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_LizardmanPr_33_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill them. All of them. Before I screw up my first job as a Daeva!</p>
