          <p>That shade-cursed thief!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said he had no place to go, so I gave him food and shelter and treated him better than he deserved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And how does he return the favor? By stealing from me! </p>

          <p>I'm talking about Phelos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He followed me around, calling me boss and bowing deeply. It's shameful, but I fell for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's bad enough to think of everything Phelos took with him when he disappeared. But what makes me really upset is that he had me so completely fooled.</p>

          <p>I know Phelos fled to Poeta, and...hey! You lived in Poeta before you became a Daeva, right? Can you chase him down?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I even have a lead for you--a weapons merchant named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amus] who'll be eager to buy what Phelos stole. How about it?</p>

          <p>I have the feeling that Phelos is a real con artist. For that matter, I'm not even sure that "Phelos" is his real name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His appearance is more distinctive than his name, anyway. He's tall and has this really peculiar nose.</p>

          <p>Oh, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amus] the weapon dealer? If he gives you any trouble, just hint that you know all about his embezzling.</p>

          <p>Well, a lot of Daevas in Sanctum don't mind a little action in exchange for a tall stack of Kinah. More than you'd think...</p>

          <p>Phelos really did that? I heard that he had a small business in Sanctum, but I had no idea it was that sort of "business," if you know what I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Phelos said he was going to try his luck in Theobomos next. And he was worried about a Daeva named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Crios] following him.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Yeah, I'm talkin' about you. Some friendly advice: keep clear of Lityerses and his crew, or you might find you're in over your head.</p>

          <p>Hah! I don't know who Phelos is, but I'd like to shake his hand for pulling one over on Lityerses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ask me, Phelos did a public service. Lityerses is a real thug--those extortion rackets of his make ordinary people live in fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Theobomos is so un-policed and out of the way, I bet it's swarming with fugitives. But I'm here on other business--nothing to do with your Phelos.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>At Lityerses's request, you tracked Phelos. You talked with Amus, a weapons merchant in Poeta, and Jenel, Phelos's friend in Verteron. But you didn't catch up to Phelos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Following Phelos' trail, you went to Theobomos and met Crios, who said he never heard of Phelos but advised you to keep clear of Lityerses.</p>
