          <p>Intolerable. How long will we be kept here, tiptoeing politely around our enemies? It grieves me that I can't give our soldiers the all-out assault I know they want.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With our Legion divided up to cover the area's vital points, we don't have the main strength for a proper hammer-blow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And my Legionaries grow demoralized...</p>

          <p>Well, a good soldier learns quickly how to wait. It's more that the Asmodians in the fortress have taken to shouting profanities against our Seraphim Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>It would hearten my troops greatly if we showed them the cost of their bad grace. If you were to slay a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1811_all] and bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1811a]s for me to hang from our banners, I think that the waiting would be...more tolerable.</P>

          <p>Be careful. The Asmodians are veterans of the Abyss, just as we are, and quite capable. I would wait until we're undertaking our next battle for the fortress and enter the place by stealth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, observe the situation closely and move when the time's right. Then kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1811_all] and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1811a]s.</p>

          <p>Centurion Menelaus' Guardians become impatient when Asmodians occupying the Krotan Refuge constantly shout profanities about the Five Seraphim Lords, and he wants to lift their spirits.</p>

          <p>You murdered Asmodian garrison troops occupying the Refuge and returned with their Archon Cloaks as the Centurion asked, which greatly lifted Legion morale.</p>
