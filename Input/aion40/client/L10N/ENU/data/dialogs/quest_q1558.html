          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. How have you been?</p>

          <p>I've been telling everyone how you dealt with the Frillnecks. I can't believe how fast you did it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you again for getting me those samples.</p>

          <p>Well, I haven't figured out why Frillnecks sometimes get so big.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ran some tests on the sample you brought, but I couldn't identify the cause. Unfortunately Senea can't take the time away from her Klaw research to help me.</p>

          <p>No! I mean...yes. I mean...what am I supposed to do, go out there and start killing them myself?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ideally I'd have a lot of them killed, but I'm no fighter and even for our garrison patrollers it'd be a dangerous slog.</p>

          <p>With your experience I should think you'd be the last Daeva to deny the danger Frillnecks pose to us all. I think Frillnecks will survive even if Atreia is destroyed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we don't do anything, the whole jungle will be overrun by Frillnecks. They'll kill and eat every other creature they can find. Are you going to do nothing and watch that happen?</p>
