          <p>We've lost the Sulfur Fortress. I blame myself, though we struggled hard to defend the walls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must do whatever I can to reclaim it. But each time I send men against the Elyos garrison, the Balaur attack us.</p>

          <p>You don't think the Elyos and the Balaur have joined forces, do you?</p>

		      <p>Right, well, a fortress in Vulnerable State is vulnerable to attacks, so the Elyos are moving in elite troops while they can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2806_all] worries me. I need them beaten, but I can't risk another battle on two fronts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, [%username]? You strike the garrison, my men fend off the Balaur?</p>

          <p>Perfect! Start mapping troop movement at Sulfur Fortress. When the fortress is vulnerable, attack.</p>
		      <p> </p>
		      <p>You must cripple the elite fighters, elite archers, elite mages, and elite priests of the Elyos, even the novice warriors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To prove the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2806_all]'s defeat, bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2806a]s back with you. </p>

          <p>Sinjah said simultaneous battles with the Elyos and the Balaur are hampering attempts to reclaim the Sulfur Fortress, and asked you to take the Elyos while he fights the Balaur.</p>
