          <p>Destiny's one of those things, you know. Always looking forward, always bracing for what's to come, but you know what's at the other end of Destiny? History. Context.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without a past, what are we? We're a blank slate. We're nothing.</p>

          <p>Yes. Ishalgen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ask me, it's time you went back and remembered what you're made of. This is what one of our travel writers has written about some of Ishalgen's more attractive spots--perhaps you should go there and collect proof of your journey.</p>

          <p>You'll need to find the spots I've written about, and meet with individuals at each location. They'll stamp your guidebook and hand you a souvenir.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come back when you've been to all three places. I hope traveling to Ishalgen is useful to you.</p>

          <p>The guidebook hinted at specific locations within the region. You visited the place that serves the most delicious food, the place that has the most beautiful sunset, and the place where the cutest ribbits are found. At each place you got a stamp in your guidebook and a souvenir.</p>

          <p>You returned to Pritta and showed her your souvenirs. She suggested you take a break from time to time, and remember your roots.</p>
