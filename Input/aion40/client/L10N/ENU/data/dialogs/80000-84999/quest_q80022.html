          <p>So many people spend all year rushing around, and then when it comes to the New Year, they move straight onto the celebrations without taking the time to look after themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell me, are you getting enough to eat?</p>

          <p>Good to hear. Fighting and flying and running about can really take it out of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, since that's the case, maybe you can help me? I'm trying to spread the New Year cheer, but my shipment of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_NEWYEAR_01A]es was waylaid and all the food has disappeared!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it was monsters, rather than people, who took it, so it's probably scattered about.</p>

          <p>You've got a good heart, [%username]. Right now I need you to find things to make the kids' lunch boxes, since they're most in need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_FOOD_NEWYEAR_3STATS]s, 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_POTION_HP_MP_40A] and 5 bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A] for one lunch, but I don't have any right now.</p>
