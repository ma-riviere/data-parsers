          <p>A Daeva! Great! Maybe just the Daeva I was looking for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was waiting for you. For a Daeva to protect the ancient Shugo empire, I mean! Yes yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much protectoring to be done here, Daeva. Much Kinah to be earned to, if you're interested?</p>

          <p>I am Indiarunark, lover of adventure and justice!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most Daevas--most Shugos as well--don't know that there used to be a proud ancient empire of the Shugos. Stretched as far as eye could see, and made all kinds of wondrous machines and inventions!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Somehow the stupid Krall and Kobolds found out about ancient empire, and have started trying to dig up our relics. Must come to you and I to stop them! Daeva will help, yes yes?</p>

          <p>Yes yes! Very good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last time I looked, Krall and Kobolds were near the graves of three greatest Shugo leaders: Trillirunerk von Richirunerk, his wife Villireshunerk von Richirunerk, and their heir Millinerunerk von Richirunerk, who died very young.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you enter the ancient tombs, you will be blessed with appearance of ancient Shugo warrior! Use that strength to punish the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDEVENT01]s!</p>
