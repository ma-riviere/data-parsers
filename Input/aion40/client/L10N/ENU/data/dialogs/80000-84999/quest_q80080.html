          <p>Welcome to Daru Days! Just because Asmodians are our enemies doesn't mean we should make enemies of their useful animals!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once Elysea is victorious, we'll still want Darus for their juicy meat and snuggly warm fur!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no one's interested in them yet. You can't imagine what I had to do to get some here from Asmodae.</p>

          <p>In a bit. But first, let me educate you on the care and feeding of Darus. You can't just give them slop like Porguses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They love to eat [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_HP_MP_40A]s and drink [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get those right here in Elysea, from the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_01A]s that monsters carry! Getting some would be a good Daru education for you!</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>
