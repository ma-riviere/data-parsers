          <p>The Millenium Festival is finally upon us! It's time to kick back, relax, and have fun!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, you know what I miss? My school days.</p>

          <p>I do! It was some of the best years of my life! The activities, the friends... I had a lot of fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But thanks to the Millenium Festival and its prizes, I get to recapture a little bit of that old magic!</p>
          <p> </p>
 	        <p>Oh, that's right; I didn't explain! I'm offering prizes to interested Daevas in honor of the Festival, if you're interested.</p>

          <p>Then you need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_06]--we've fed it to creatures across Atreia. Just kill them to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring enough of it to me, and you can trade it in for a variety of special prizes--including the nostalgic items I mentioned.</p>

          <p>You might even have what you need right now. You should check before you do anything else.</p>

          <p>That's why education is so important. Sure, it's possible to learn on one's own, but when you're with other students...</p>

          <p>Let me sum up: good job! Please go ahead and pick out your prize, courtesy of the Millenium Festival!</p>
