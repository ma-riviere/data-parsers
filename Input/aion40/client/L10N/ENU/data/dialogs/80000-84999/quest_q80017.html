          <p>Oh! Hahaha! Not just any old socks, no offense. I know I asked you to do this before, but apparently nothing I can do is enough to deter those shugos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Y'see, I hung up the socks, like you're supposed to, and instead of being filled with presents, they disappeared again! I'm sure they've been dragged around half of Elysea by now, so they're bound to be covered in muck. But I'd still like to get them back.</p>
