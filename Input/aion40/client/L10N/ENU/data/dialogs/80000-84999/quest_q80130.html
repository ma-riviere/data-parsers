          <p>I'm a member of a...covert organization that answers only to Lady Lumiel herself. We run operations all across Atreia.</p>

          <p>My partner Heloise and I have been on a particularly important one recently, but I've run into...unforseen roadblocks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Time is precious, and short. So I need someone who can take care of these roadblocks while I work. Can you be that one?</p>

          <p>They stole some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80130A]s that I need back. They may seem ordinary, but I assure you they're not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How and why is on a need-to-know basis. And you don't need to know. Just that this is very important to the future of Asmodae.</p>
