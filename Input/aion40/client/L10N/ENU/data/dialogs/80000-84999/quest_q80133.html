          <p>That letter of mine contains important information that should get to my partner Craig.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's imperative, above all else, that I get some intelligence that I'm expecting from him. I can't emphasize this enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet, it's too risky for us to meet in person.</p>

          <p>Absolutely not! That would put all of us at risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, we have a professional contact in place at the Altgard Trade Brokerage.</p>

          <p>Perfect. This operation may turn out well yet. As soon as I can get my hands on [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_TANABATA_02B], things will move quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've ever been to the Altgard Trade Brokerage before, you'll be able to spot the contact. He's new there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, with your reputation, you might have come across the letter already without knowing it. Can you check?</p>

          <p>If you can't do it, I can't get anyone else who can on such short notice. Your refusal will cost lives. Many lives.</p>
