          <p>Meitri was supposed to watch out for the Sailing Ribbons that carry lights out on the water. And he watched, all right. Watched them get stolen by Gumigumis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You stole the Ribbons back, and a relieved Meitri rewarded you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the Festival of Light is safe. Lady Lumiel can find Asmodae and channel Aether where its most needed. If you believe in that sort of thing.</p>
