          <p>I don't mean to impose or anything, but... well, it's a matter of the heart. That's got you interested, right?</p>

          <p>Oh, no, nothing like that! Well, not yet, anyway. You see... there's a girl I like, and I want to tell her how I feel. I know she might reject me, but I just can't bottle it up any longer!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am known for my fine hand-tooled leatherworking, and I want to give her a gift to go along with my message. Just the other day, it came to me: a bag! Made from only the finest leather, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do have one thing I need help with, though. Are you game?</p>

          <p>Oh, that's a relief! I'm sure you won't have much trouble with this, but really, the finest leather comes from Red Basilisks. And I'll need a fair number--you can only use a small amount of hide from each animal, so I'll need 12 or thereabouts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll craft that into something fit for an Empyrean Lord!</p>

          <p>...There, done! See, look at that! With workmanship like that, how can she refust? Now, ah, I hope it's not too much of an imposition to ask you to deliver it to her? See, I'll tuck a letter into the pocket.</p>
