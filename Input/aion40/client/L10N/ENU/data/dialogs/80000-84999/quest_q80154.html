          <p>Okay, then, I can see you like to cut right to the chase. Most folks go for that whole mystical thing, but you're not most folks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I really do have a bit of a... well, let's just call it a gift. I've got a pretty good offer for you if you're interested. No real effort required on your part--well, not beyond what you were going to do anyway.</p>

          <p>All it is is, you have to succeed at the 3rd stage of the Empyrean Crucible. I need you to get me a Crucible Mark from the end of that stage, and I can use it to put in a good word for you with the Powers That Be. I've got an in with a Shedim Lord. Not saying which one, mind. For the charm to work, I just need a token of some particular trial that you've undertaken.</p>

          <p>Well, limited time offer, is all I'm saying. Don't let my mumbo-jumbo put you off. The gift's real, it's just that most people don't buy it unless you spruce it up with some playacting.</p>
