          <p>Ah, yes, well. But do they know... ah... that you are headed to the Crucibles? Something in your confident stride, your determined countenance. Most would miss it; I can read it like a scroll.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have an offer that you will want to hear. Bring me a token of your trials, a trifle, a trinket. With that, the good fortune I can bring you is endless.</p>

          <p>The token is onerous for most to obtain, but worthless in its own right. I'm sure a hero like you will have hundreds by nightfall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must simply pass through the 3rd stage of the Empyrean Crucible. At the end of that stage, you will find a Crucible Mark.</p>

          <p>I should have specified. It is a Crucible Mark I need. I'm sorry; I should have remembered that not everyone has my mental gifts.</p>

          <p>Don't be discouraged. This is not your only chance. Simply bring me a mark, and I will work my charms. Hurry, though, for I must soon move on!</p>
