          <p>That's all right. I'll find some other way to get the medicine to her. Maybe a Shugo will help me.</p>

          <p>Oh! This is some Ancient Ginseng! I've heard that its effects are practically miraculous.</p>

          <p>It's also very expensive. Netalion must be doing well as a Daeva in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>It's a shame we can't see him, but this will help my wife immensely. Thank you for delivering it, Daeva.</p>
