          <p>Welcome to Daru Days! Asmodae may be our enemy, but it certainly breeds a good animal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guardians who enter rifts return with all kinds of stories about useful Darus!</p>

          <p>Maybe in a bit. But first, let me educate you on the care and feeding of Darus. You can't just give them slop like Porguses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They love to eat [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_HP_MP_40A]s and drink [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, you can get those right here in Elysea, from the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_01A]s that monsters carry! Getting some would be a good Daru education for you!</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>

          <p>It's fortunate for us that we can make Hay Crackers and Carrot Juice.</p>
