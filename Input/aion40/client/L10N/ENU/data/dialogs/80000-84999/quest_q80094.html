          <p>Hello [%username], I didn't see you there. Yes, thanks to you, I think I am beginning to figure out what I did wrong in my incantation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, so very close to figuring out what the Pumpkin King did to me...</p>

          <p>Um, yes...didn't I tell you? The Pumpkin King Minis. He's...evil. He must be stopped! That's what I was trying to do when my incantation failed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I play my cards right this time, no one will escape! No one will escape...my thanks! For all the help the Daevas of Sanctum have given me. You are all so kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just need one more thing. The Pumpkin King had Witch Hunters steal Soul's Lights from me. I need them back. Then perhaps this nightmare will end! Will you help?</p>
