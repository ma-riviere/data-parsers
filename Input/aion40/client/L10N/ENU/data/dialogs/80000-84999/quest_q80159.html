          <p>Is there a draft? You'd think this was Asmodae, with how cold it's been lately. The cold really gets into your bones. Not that you'd know about that, Daeva!</p>

          <p>I have this cane, but it's not much help if my hands freeze so much I can't keep hold of it.</p>

          <p>I'd love a pair of gloves. Maybe something lined with nice, warm, brax fur. That's what we used to wear when I was a young lady, but you don't see them so much nowadays.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard they were giving some away in the [%shoplink]. Giving them away! Can you imagine? They used to cost 3,000 kinah. It doesn't sound like much now, but back in those days... Well. It's no use dreaming of brax fur when I can't leave this spot even to pick up a free pair. Unless you were willing to get them for me?</p>

          <p>Well, ah. Yes, these are gloves, but I'm only standing in the street, not taking on a Balaur single-handedly. I could never get my poor, twisted fingers into armor like this.</p>

          <p>No, I just want the Brax Gloves. I don't care that they're free. Just visit the [%shoplink], and then don't forget to check your Express Mail.</p>

          <p>Thank you, young [%username]. It's not every Daeva who will stop and do an old lady a good turn. Now, please take this egg. I was hoping to keep it, but I have to be honest with myself. I can't keep up with a pet these days, and my son is too absent-minded to look after it.</p>
