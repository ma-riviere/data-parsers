          <p>Finally! It's finally warming up! Maybe one of these years, Anair might melt enough for a sailing trip? No? Too much to hope for?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, even if Anair stays frozen over, I want to really DO summer properly this year. Sailor costumes? Check. Bucket and spade? Check. Sailboat? Ah... there's the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the boat I bought has a few... hitches.</p>

          <p>Haha, maybe it is! I'm not really up on them. No, what I meant is, it's in need of some repair, and the materials I ordered to do it seem to have gone missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The delivery was on its way through Besfer Ghost Village--Aion knows why!--and it was ambushed by monsters, who made off with the boards I had specially cut.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, here's a thought. You remember the dare games everyone played as kids? Well, I dare you to go find my boards for me!</p>

          <p>Great! It's like a game! I remember going to Besfer Ghost Village myself, when my pal Azuela dared me to, running up to a creepy house, and touching it. Of course, that was before those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerD_33_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerMinerD_33_n]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerD_35_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3SnowD_34_An]s took over the place completely. No way my parents would have let me near it otherwise!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come to think of it, those are probably the same creatures who grabbed my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80048A]s! Try killing some and seeing if you can find my missing materials on them.</p>

          <p>Oooh, goodie! Heh, I become more and more of a kid the more I think about my sailing trip. Hey, I even have a name picked out for the ship. What do you think of the 'Ampreh Blossom'?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, anyway, I suppose I'm not going to get her ready before we have another lords-forsaken winter, so you might as well take this costume I was going to wear on my boat. I'll have another made up for myself by next summer.</p>
