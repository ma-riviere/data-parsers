          <p>Whew! I'm glad that's over with! Those passphrases are getting more and more ridiculous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I've heard your name before.... So now you're involved in all this, eh? I guess things are getting serious. At any rate, you want a letter, yes? Unfortunately for you, you have to suffer for the cheapness of your bosses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, I'm not a paid operative--just a freelancer. And they've been...slow to pay me lately. So if you want the letter, you'll have to do me a favor first.</p>

          <p>Very smart. Don't worry, though--helping me out will also make your bosses' future assignments that much easier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80068A]. It has special properties that allow me to...well, I'd probably bore you going on about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get some from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerMinerD_33_n]s and I'll trade for the letter. I think that's more than fair with what's at stake here.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't look at me like that. It's not like I'm demanding a million Kinah or a hundred Elroco pelts! Just a little something to make life easier! Is that so wrong?</p>
