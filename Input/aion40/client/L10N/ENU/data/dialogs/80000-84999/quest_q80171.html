          <p>Step right up, Daevas who dare to take on an extra special Millenium Festival challenge!</p>

          <p>You there! [%userclass]! Are you strong enough, determined enough, ASMODIAN enough, to take on this challenge?</p>

          <p>Ah, there's Asmodian confidence! I love it! Both the Millenium Festival and Asmodae could use even more Daevas like you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will have to work and fight hard, very hard, to gather the items you need to complete this task.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Like the other challenges, these are in the possession of monsters all across Atreia. Perhaps you've come across some in battle?</p>

          <p>If so, have you completed the special challenge without even knowing it? That would be a mark of a truly dedicated Daeva!</p>
