          <p>Did anyone ever tell you as a kid that those were the best days of your life? Well, I think I get it now. Not a care in the world, and those long summers... ahh, to have those days back again. I had a plan. I even had sailboat to take us to a tropical island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only, our sailboats need repairing from last year, and monsters have made off with all the materials.</p>

          <p>These ones were already cut to size. It'd be much quicker just to get them back than start again. Well, quicker for someone like you, that is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know! Why don't we turn this into a game? You remember when you were a kid, and you dared your friends to go and touch the creepy house... Well, how's about I dare you to head to the Outpost Ruins and sort out those monsters?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've taken the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80043A]s--and I just know you can get them back.</p>

          <p>Oh, thanks, Daeva. If you could just bring us back those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80043A]s from the Outpost Ruins, we'd all appreciate it. With any luck, we'll go sailing before the summer is over. And if not, at least we'll be ready for next year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lobster_25_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Maidengolem_26_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Displacerbeast_27_An]s in the Outpost Ruins are the ones who made off with the planks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]! Here are the gifts I promised you. Perhaps they'll help you keep the spirit of childhood, sailing or no.</p>

          <p>I mean, summer will be over before we get them, at this rate. Oh well, maybe we'll have a late heat wave, like last year.</p>

          <p>You recovered the planks, but it seems unlikely that the boat will be ready in time.</p>
