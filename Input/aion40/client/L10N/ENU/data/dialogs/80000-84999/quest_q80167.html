          <p>I can't believe that I was pulled from my regular duties to work the Millenium Festival!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that my regular duties were vital to the war effort or anything, but can we really afford to yank talented Daevas like me to work parties?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I assure you, not being able to enjoy the Festival myself has NOTHING to do with my complaints.</p>

          <p>Ah, well, I suppose I get a little enjoyment from helping other Daevas have fun. A little.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For instance, my duties here involve a little scavenger hunt, of sorts. There are prizes involved!</p>

          <p>Then here's what you need to do: find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_05]s scattered across Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They shouldn't be hard to find; they've been seeded with all sorts of monsters and foes just for this event.</p>

          <p>You might've come across some already. If you happen to have enough right now, it'll save us both a lot of time.</p>
