          <p>Do you think it's warmer this year than last year? Maybe it's just wishful thinking, but perhaps one day we'll see a summer like they say we used to have before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I still think childhood summers were the best, though! Such a change after the long winter... and none of the responsibilities I have these days. I thought my parents were being stupid when they went on about it being the 'best days of my life', but now I totally get them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even the plans I make as an adult never quite seem to work out!</p>

          <p>Oh, it's just this sailboat. I bought her cheap, had a plan to fix her up. I've never done anything like this before, so maybe I made a mistake letting them ship the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80049A]s through the Frost Spirit Valley.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems like the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Elementalair3D_43_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Elementalair4D_43_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CyclopsReD_43_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CyclopsReD_45_An]s intercepted the shipment and ate all the boards! I don't dare try and get them back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oooh, 'dare'! That gives me an idea. I dare you, [%username], to go and find my boards!</p>
