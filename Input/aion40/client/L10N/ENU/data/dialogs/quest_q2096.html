          <p>Listen carefully--we can't risk being overheard. Kasir smuggled me a message--something about a new star appearing over Atreia. I couldn't really understand the reference, but he asked me to send you to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's still in the Hidden Library. Try to meet inconspicuously--they're always watching him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure what any of it means, but Kasir seems to think it's important.</p>

          <p>...Don't look so shocked. I thought it might be you when we first met, but now I'm certain. But tell Munin this--two stars have appeared, and one is blood red. Make sure you're not followed....</p>
