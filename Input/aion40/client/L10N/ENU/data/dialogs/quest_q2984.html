          <p>I'm so sick and tired of this! Purple last time, and brown this time...forget it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kinot]'s store to buy dyes, and he offered to give me the dyes for free if I got the dye materials for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought it was a good deal, at first....</p>

          <p>It's just that getting those dye materials is tricky. I thought I could just get some plants from somewhere nearby, but boy was I wrong.</p>

          <p>He's so fastidious! He has to have this from that region for every color, and nagging about how even one color requires mixing a number of different pigments....</p>

          <p>Now I'm on my way back from Altgard and then Morheim, because he said there's not enough Brown Dye.</p>

          <p>Some people grumble about how much dyes cost, but to get true colors you need particular pigments from particular sources. Just obtaining those costs me a lot of money.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been asking patrons to gather the ingredients, but not too many take me up on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come to think of it, Lusena's due to bring me some pigments, and she's a little late.</p>
