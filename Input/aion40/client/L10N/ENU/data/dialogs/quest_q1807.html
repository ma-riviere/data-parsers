          <p>You must have heard that we lost the Asteria Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a blow, but we must pull out of our dive and retake it, as we have before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The main hurdle is our lack of troops, so we need to develop a strategy to overcome that.</p>

          <p>It involves surprise attacks. We believe it will be more effective than a mass assault.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Asmodians have Dredgion support, so we don't want to give them a troop concentration to focus their firepower on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll launch several raids at once, with small nimble squads. The goal is to throw the Asmodians into total confusion. I think you could play a key role in this plan.</p>

          <p>Good. We've got a good plan, but with your help, I'm even more confident of success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While we'll certainly kill some Asmodians, the primary goal is to demoralize them. If we can reduce their will to fight, our smaller numbers can still win the day.</p>
