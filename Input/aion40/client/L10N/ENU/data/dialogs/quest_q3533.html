          <p>The Lepharists seem to think they're doing what's best for the common Atreian. If I squinted and stared hard at some of their acts, I'd almost believe them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But some of the things they're responsible for...I just don't see how they could possibly delude themselves into thinking WE'RE the evil ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their experiments...what they do to living beings.... It turns my stomach, and I have a strong stomach, [%username].</p>

          <p>You can say that again. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RM78] is one of the worst of their "test subjects." It's hideous, powerful, and possesses animal cunning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we could show Elysea what the Lepharists are really doing behind closed doors, maybe we could blunt their recruitment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to hunt down and destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RM78]. Then I can spread your story throughout the world, show the Lepharists' true colors.</p>

          <p>Maybe those who're vulnerable to the Lepharists' lies will just dismiss this as deception on our part. But I think we need to give this a try.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If nothing else, we'll show our strength by taking down one of their greatest "creations."</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF3LP_SZ_1] is where you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RM78]. Good luck. I think you'll need it.</p>

          <p>You don't seem to grasp what kind of threat the Lepharists are. They may not be as strong militarily as the Asmodians or Balaur, but who knows how long that'll last?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they continue to recruit and build more like this RM-78c, they could turn a two front war into a three front one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely you can't want that. You must realize that we would inevitably lose such a confrontation.</p>

          <p>Hmph, I thought so. That's what Lepharists are really like, [%username]. That's what they want for Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their goals would be laudible, if they weren't so obvious smoke screens. I wonder what they really truly want?</p>

          <p>Nerison was repulsed by the Lepharists' experiments, especially RM-78c. He asked you to destroy it as a propaganda coup.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You fought your way through the Aetherogenetics Lab and defeated the monstrosity. Nerison was pleased, hoping this would slow down Lepharist recruitment.</p>
