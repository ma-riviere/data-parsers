          <p>Fortunately, Dukar ate every piece of the Lean Ribs, [%username].</p>

          <p>But now it's refusing to eat again! It keeps saying that it wants Kselopen Sausage.</p>

          <p>I don't even know what that is! I asked around and no one else seems to know either.</p>

          <p>I kept asking and finally Muorinerk said he'd heard that it can't be found in Asmodae at all. The sausage is only made in Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder how Dukar heard of it?</p>

          <p>Muorinerk told me that if I gather the ingredients, he could find a Shugo to make the sausage. According to him, a Shugo named Orashunerk in the Desert Garrison cooks all kinds of exotic dishes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But where am I supposed to get the ingredients? I can't go to Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username]... Would you go to Elysea through the Rift and bring the ingredients? I know it's dangerous. But if you get it for me, I will reward you handsomely. </p>
