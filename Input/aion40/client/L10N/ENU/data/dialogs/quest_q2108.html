          <p>Come closer, [%userclass]. Bacorerk has a job for you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am a cube maker. Finest magical cubes, bigger on the inside than on the outside! Very important! Akakak! However, old cubes need tending, also. Bacorerk can restore their luster and beauty! Even the boss has given me his cube to repair! Very important job!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To make best job of it, highest quality oils required. If you don't help get them, Bacorerk will make sure Wise Ulgorn knows why his cube looks drab. Akakak!</p>
