          <p>Hey, [%username]. Are you headed to the Latheron Coast? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It used to be called the Latheron Straits, though there's nothing there now but sand and the ghost of a long-dead sea.</p>

          <p>Yes, once. It was beautiful then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, the only reason anyone ever goes there now is to get to Bab-el-Madeb. There's still some water there thanks to the geysers, though it's nothing like it once was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Coast has become a dangerous place, full of ravening beasts who prey on any travelers they find. Even Daevas are not immune to the danger they represent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now and then some worthy souls venture in to kill some of the predators and make the journey safer, but it's a thankless task. Only the truly blessed are chosen to try. </p>

          <p>Do you have the spirit of a true Guardian? I can't abandon my post, but our numbers are few and the need is great. Would you be willing to help clear the way? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While most creatures on the coast are treacherous, the real dangers are Karnifs and Scolopens. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_Kalnif_45_An]s slash with their sharp claws causing heavy wounds, while [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_ScorpionRough_45_An]s have a virulent poison that weakens even the strongest Daevas, leaving them helpless. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is little I can offer you but our thanks and the mention of your name in our blessings. You would be doing us a great service, though. Will you?</p>
