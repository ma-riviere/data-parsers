          <p>I am a vegetarian. I rarely eat meat as I find it muddles my thoughts. Except for the delicious fish that Lif prepares for me--Oh so delicious!</p>

          <p>Generally I can eat things found in the Patamor Thicket though... Do you want to help me?</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's very kind of you to do this for me.</p>

          <p>I think [%dic:STR_DIC_E_vegetable_d_n_c_20a]s should be good. It's easy to digest, rich in fiber and quite tasty.</p>

          <p>Ooooh... tasty tasty Rabano! Mmmm!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some people say that Rabano has neither taste nor smell. But I think that's just because the taste is subtle and they somehow miss it completely. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My sense of taste is quite delicate. There are so many nuances within food!</p>

          <p>Anyway, thanks to you, I can appease my hunger!</p>
