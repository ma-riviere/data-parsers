          <p>Young Daeva, will you listen to what I have to say?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see...phantasms! I see numerous phantasms around you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An overwhelming presence...a burden you must bear as part of your fate.</p>

          <p>This charm.... It transfers your experience to those in your care.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your bond to them will thus become stronger, and preserve you from future harm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is good for those who are enlightened to lead those who are left behind. And these forms.... They are already bound to you by fate. Would this not be fitting?</p>

          <p>Ahhh, you are wise. But this will not be without cost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Melicar and buy some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_CHARM_LIGHT_50]. Oh, and also prepare about 90,000 Kinah for the charm. This price will not be matched.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Should I just quit now, rather than pouring more time into something I'll never achieve?</p>

          <p>Anyway, Flora has just one piece of advice for me. I must continue with my training, and avoid other distractions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, that's a weight off my mind! You should have her read your fortune as well, Daeva. You look as if something's weighing on you as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know some are suspicious of Flora, but just look at what she's done for me! Get her some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_CHARM_LIGHT_50] so she can make you a charm. You won't regret it!</p>
