          <p>I just got done with a short survey of this area. While I was in the Frillneck habitat I saw a huge egg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm telling you [%username], this egg was so big my jaw dropped. And when I tried to get a better look at it...it moved!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I figured anything that'd come out of an egg that size would be pretty dangerous, so I ran. But now I'm a bit worried.</p>

          <p>Well, the egg was in the Frillneck habitat, so I think it must be a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_FrillfaimamEgg_Q1556].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it is, it could be trouble for all of Heiron if we don't do anything.</p>

          <p>The Gojira is an enormous Frillneck--as big as a tower. Anything coming out of that egg is likely to be huge, mean, and hungry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We certainly can't afford to have two Gojiras running around. You need to destroy that egg, and while you're at it, bring back a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1556a] for study. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And keep your eyes open for that Gojira!</p>

          <p>Frillnecks grow really fast.</p>

          <p>If we let that thing hatch it could be huge by the time we muster a response.</p>

          <p>This is the sample from the little Gojira in the egg?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you very much. I'll study this and see if I can determine why Gojiras get so big. We don't want all the Frillnecks to get that large, do we!</p>
