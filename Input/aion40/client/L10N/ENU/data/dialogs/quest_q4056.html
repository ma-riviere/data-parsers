          <p>They follow orders. Simple and true! They'd follow orders o' anyone wearing a cap'n's hat. So when [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_TesinonSeamanNMDQ_50_An] stole me hat and gave 'em the order to jettison ol' Jackdaw, they just did what they were told.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That scurvy cur is still swaggering aboard me ship. Wearing me hat! If'n I could exact revenge on any o' em, it'd be Barousan who gets it all. But alas, I can't even reach him.</p>

          <p>Thar's a strong wind blowin' on the Carobian Coast. If ye jump from a high enough cliff, ye can ride the wind and the geysers to me ship.
