          <p>If we're to keep up our strength, then we have to eat, right? But neither of my companions here care much about food, so the task falls to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would prefer hot meals, but it can get difficult with three of us. Finding enough of the ingredients takes so long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I finally started making jerky. Drying out the meat makes it last longer and I can do it in bulk, so I don't have to do it for every meal.</p>

          <p>So far, very well. I've discovered that the lean rib meat and sirloin of Ettins are the best for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received a few coins to use while assisting out here. If you gather some of the meat for me, I'll be glad to give you one of them.</p>

          <p>Excellent. You can find what I need near the fortress and on Vaizel's Peak--[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1506a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1506b] from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ettin_32_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_EttinBig_32_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
