          <p>Azphelumbra. Nice to meet you. You look like you've seen your share of trouble. But then, which of us hasn't, lately?</p>

          <p>The Shedim Lords always watch over us. Keep your faith out there, even when you're in trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, people here seem so agitated. I don't know what's gone on with the alliance and the Reian tribe, but we must remember it's all because of our Lords' doing.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're directed by their will. We just need to do our best to follow it.</p>
