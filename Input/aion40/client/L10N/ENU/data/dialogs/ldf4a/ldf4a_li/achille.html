          <p>I've seen Legions come and go, but only a few ever really achieve greatness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's natural, I guess. If they could all be great, we'd have won the war by now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope that your Legion is one of those that will do great things and that my service is part of what helps you to that glorious day.</p>
