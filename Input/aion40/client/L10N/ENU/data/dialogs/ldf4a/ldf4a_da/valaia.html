          <p>Why don't you think it over before socketing Manastones?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can spend all day counting Daevas asking me to remove the Manastones in their Cubes that they randomly socketed every time they got new battle gear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait. I remain a service provider because of them. I should be appreciative, right? Ha ha.</p>
