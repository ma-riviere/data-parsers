          <p>At first I pitied the poor souls of our kin, wandering eternally, twisted by their deaths. We all did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now, after months of trying to keep them in check, I'm starting to see them as nuisances. I still want them to rest, but for different reasons!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does that make me selfish? I admit I have no concept of their suffering, but they're certainly making ME suffer.</p>
