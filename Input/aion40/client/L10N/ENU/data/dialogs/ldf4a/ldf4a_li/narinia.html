          <p>Clerics, Chanters, Sorcerers, and Spiritmasters play vital roles in war. Thus, I reward their efforts with Stigmas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They lend power that leads to further victories. Success breeds success, you see?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What kind of Stigma may I show you today, so you may use it for Elysea's glory?</p>

          <p>You appear to be confused. Are you sure you can use Stigmas? And have you earned Abyss Points?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to have both covered if you want my Stigmas. These rewards must be earned by service to Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you take care of what needs to be taken care of. Then, you may be deserving of what I have.</p>
