          <p>Relics from the before the Cataclysm are  important reminders of where we came from.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meeting the Reians has made us reconsider our history, and made items like Ancient Seals even more important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any you bring me will help cement our alliance with the Reians, and I'll reward you appropriately.</p>

          <p>Do you know what Ancient Seals look like? Because I do, and you don't have any.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You seem to be an intelligent Daeva. I'll assume this to be a mistake, and not just stupidity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you have Ancient Seals on hand the next time you speak with me.</p>
