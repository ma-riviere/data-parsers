          <p>This is a pretty gruesome place to keep watch, isn't it? This used to be the camp of a group of Humnaz who had the gall to challenge [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_Calydonchief_Nmd_57_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Haridoo wiped them out personally, I've heard. The Humnaz are always on guard for signs of weakness in their leaders, so this was probably an ideal opportunity for the Chieftain to prove his strength and eliminate troublemakers at the same time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The bodies are disgusting, but the stench covers our smell and keeps the rest of the Humnaz at a distance.</p>
