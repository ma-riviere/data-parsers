          <p>What do you think is the best defense, [%username]? Our standard answer is "The kin to my left, and the kin to my right," correct?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The truth is this: the best defense is a collected mind. You cannot forever rely on others for your life, because you will not always fight alongside others.</p>

          <p>That's not to say that our mantra does not hold value. It clearly does. We all know that our spirit and collective work has dragged our people through the darkest and coldest of nights. But we must adapt, and realize that there is no universal gain in relying on others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Work well alone, and you will work well with others. Blood for blood.</p>
