          <p>Even the most unforgiving terrain is no problem for an experienced hunter. Good hunters don't mind dense forests or rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>Of course, only a few have such talent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Naturally, I am one of them. I can run as fast as lightning and my body is honed to perfection. It seems I have the body of a Shedim Lord!</p>

          <p>I simply speak the truth. Surely one should not lie about one's capabilities? Of course strength is not all-important. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speed of movement is essential as well. If you want to become faster, you have to challenge yourself by hunting the fastest animals. A Nimble Maeki, for example.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're swift as an arrow! I've hunted many Nimble Maekis to hone my skills.</p>
