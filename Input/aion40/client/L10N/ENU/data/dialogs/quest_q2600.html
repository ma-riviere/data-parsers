          <p>Of all the timing! Azphel laughs at me, I'm sure of it. What else can explain it?! Listen, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was out surveying earlier, when I stumbled across the largest sample of Malek Ore I've ever seen. Larger than your wingspan, I'd wager.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, that's not something I can just ignore, so I come back here for my tools, only to find fresh orders from General Nerita waiting for me. Beluslan's blacksmiths need iron ore, of all things, and I'm the one they want to gather it.</p>

          <p>Not with the deadline Nerita gave me. And, sure as thunder follows lightning, the Shugo will have that Malek in their sights.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't stand by and watch those profiteering furballs hack away at that Malek Ore, not when there's genuine research to be done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you bring me samples of the ore, [%username]? </p>

          <p>Now I hope you've got strong shoulders. That ore isn't likely to yield anything from tapping--you'll need one lengthy swing to get that thing broken up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, your average pick probably won't do anything even with a twenty yard run-up. You'll need something specialized for the job. Maybe one of the tools I've seen those Kidorun Grave Robber Band wandering about with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ask Huarinrinerk if you can use one of their picks. Just don't tell her why you need it, understand?</p>

As per Horu's instructions, you were given the Kidorun Thieves Pick by Huarinrinerk and went to mine the gigantic Malek ore.

          <p>You mentioned the Drake on your return to Horu, who suspected that it might well have been the protector of the ore.</p>
