          <p>Prepare yourself: we're sending you beyond the fortress walls on a mission.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_12] are camped around the Fortress--have been for several days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't know much about them. They seem to be violent insurgents who are trying to incite a general revolt against the Shedim Lords and seize Pandaemonium. Yeah, I know how ridiculous that sounds.</p>

          <p>They're probably watching who's coming and going. And you're going to teach them the perils of curiosity.</p>

          <p>Good. Let's show these scoundrels that the unified strength of Asmodae has no room for their "revolution." Head north from here and attack their camps on the shores of Altgard Ice Lake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you kill four or more [%dic:STR_DIC_E_12], that'll probably teach the others a lesson. And it's all right if some survive to tell their "rebel leaders" that Altgard Fortress stands loyal to the Shedim Lords!</p>

          <p>Azphel and the Shedim Lords guided us safely through the chaos of the Cataclysm, and those Lepharist idiots want someone else to lead Asmodae? They've been out in the sun too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't want them spying on us, and I don't want their propaganda poisoning the troops here.</p>
