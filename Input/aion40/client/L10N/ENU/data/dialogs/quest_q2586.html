          <p>When my research becomes public, it will dazzle the archaeology world. It will reveal to the world the legendary Alukina's Palace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Seirens? Can you just picture these academics stumbling over themselves to be "experts" on beautiful singers who can kill with a word?</p>

          <p>My investigations are going to be incredibly detailed, thorough, and systematic. It's the only way to silence my critics, except for the postprocessualists--but who listens to them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am having a few issues. The one that is giving me the most headaches are the grave robbers, of course.</p>
