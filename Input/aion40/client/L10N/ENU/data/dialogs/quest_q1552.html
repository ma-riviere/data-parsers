          <p>I've never liked Frillnecks. Horrible, filthy creatures, aggressive and spiteful. When I was a student I worked with Frillneck hatchlings and one of the little monsters almost bit my finger off!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So imagine my surprise when I got a letter from Sanctum, asking me to gather and ship back 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1552a]. I was stunned. They want me to go hunt wild Frillnecks?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sheer insanity!</p>

          <p>There's a craftsman back in Sanctum who thinks Frillneck teeth will make good arrowheads. I can understand why he might think that. Frillnecks never lose prey once they bite it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have a distinctive jaw structure, but also exceptionally sharp teeth that remain keen and sharp for years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But why me?! There are lots of immortal Daevas here, but I have only one life! </p>
