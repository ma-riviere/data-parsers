          <p>I don't know why, but Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Valerius] asked me to find you, and tell you to come to the Fortress as secretly as you can manage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said to make sure no one follows you. It sounds very important, doesn't it?</p>

          <p>Ahh, [%username]. I'm glad you came. I trust you took precautions to make sure you weren't followed? I have an important mission for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Elyos face a difficult war, fighting against the Balaur as well as the Asmodians in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the past, our strategy was simply to send our most skilled Daevas into the battle. But this has only led to a stalemate. We must use new strategies.</p>

        <html>
        <body>
          <p>We have begun using subterfuge. The Asmodians have always surpassed us in this field, but we've made progress. We've sent spies into Asmodae to learn their language, work there, and collect information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To support them, we send money and orders regularly, but getting into enemy territory without getting caught is no easy task. Not to mention getting out. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go to Morheim in Asmodae, there is a place called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_A2]. In an old house near the path, there is a spy called Medea, who is disguised as an herb gatherer. I will give you a package to take to her. It's a very dangerous affair, but also very important.</p>

          <p>You haven't been to Asmodae yet? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you use the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_directportal], you can get there easily. And it is much safer, since you don't have to pass through the Abyss. Of course, you must wait for the Rift to open. The nearest Rift is the one behind the Fortress. There is also a Rift in the Eiron Desert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you complete the mission in Asmodae just use your returning magic. There's no other way back to Elysea.</p>

          <p>In order to gather information I recruit spies among the enemy forces. Many Daeva are willing to sell their own side out for money. It's reprehensible, but I don't doubt there are Elyos traitors as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was actually running rather short on money. So this delivery is just in time. This is my latest report on enemy activities. Deliver this to Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Valerius] with all haste.</p>
