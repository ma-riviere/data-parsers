          <p>A runaway Lepharist is a good thing in my opinion--anything to derease their numbers. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you know what people will think if they know one Lepharist is nearby?</p>

          <p>Exactly!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems like this Freki trusts you. Go talk to him and convince him to leave the area.</p>

          <p>I don't care where he goes as long as it's far away from the fortress.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I know one runaway Lepharist doesn't sound like much, but as long as he's there, these rumors won't die down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Check out the cottage and see if he's is still there. Since you discovered his hiding spot, maybe he's already gone. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Otherwise, I'm counting on you to convince him to go away. Then we can put these rumors to rest.</p>
