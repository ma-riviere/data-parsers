          <p>Daeva, have you heard of Tigraki Studio? Shugo are busy working there, crafting fine goods, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Same as Shugo anywhere, but Tigraki make fine weapons, armor, drugs, and even food from Balaur's body parts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They say they are not merchants but "noble craftsmen" seeking luxury. But they are great merchants too, so I am willing to look past that attitude, akakakakak.</p>

          <p>Boasting makes Tierunerk sick, but would also be solid business partners. If my agency can deal in Tigraki materials and armor, there is much Kinah in it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Tierunerk hears that old schoolmate Gaochinerk became member of Tigraki Studio, knew that chance had come.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Problem is, Tigraki hide away deep in Reshanta, nyerk. Even for Daevas who fly freely, it is difficult to reach. For Shugo, no chance!</p>

          <p>Yes! If you fly west from Asteria in top part of Reshanta, you will see small island. That is Tigraki Island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reshanta Branch Chief Jarumonerk known to be hard to please. He will not meet anyone unless Gaochinerk tells him, so talk to Gaochinerk first!</p>

          <p>If you do meet Jarumonerk, give him my regards and this box. He will want to do business when he sees present inside, akakakakak.</p>
