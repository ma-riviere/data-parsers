          <p>Look at this! It's a report from Nerison, a Daeva of Zephyr working at the Research Center Overwatch in Heiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He attached something...unusual to the report.</p>

          <p>He had found a torn piece of discarded paper. When he examined it, he thought it might be a report written by one of the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>

          <p>Right. You see my concern. There's the part of me that wants to know what that means...then the part that...really doesn't, if you follow me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know anything else about this, though. I've got nothing more than what's in front of me: six words that give me the chills.</p>

          <p>Nerison's report said that he found this paper at the Lepharist Research Center in Heiron, near a group of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LabPo_LehparBioWi_41_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lab_LehparAs_42_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LabPo_LehparBioPr_42_An]s. If you look in the right places, you might find the rest of this note.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was fortunate that the torn piece Nerison picked up was at the bottom of the page. See that page number there? If this is four, then there are at least three others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may be kept by three different people. I'll wait here, but please hurry.</p>

          <p>Xenophon received a report from Nerison on recent Lepharist activities. Attached to it was a scrap of paper that appeared to be part of a research report about live subject experimentation on Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The torn paper said the Human remodeling experiment was nearing completion.</p>

          <p>Xenophon wanted to know what Lepharists were up to before they caused a more serious problem. You went to the Lepharist Research Center, obtained the rest of the research paper, and delivered it to Xenophon.</p>
