       <p>Transporter work isn't easy these days. The Flame Tribes of the Bloodburn Reach are getting bolder every day.</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>The Ridge of Latesran is critical for teleportation between the layers, and these sapiens are not only obstructing my work, but they may permanently damage the ridge.</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>I made a report to the Primum Fortress, but they couldn't send anyone. They sent me a silver coin and said to find a Daeva who could deal with it.</p>

          <p>Exactly!</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>How about it, [%username]? Would you go to the Bloodburn Reach and mop up those dirty [%dic:STR_DIC_A_Ab1_2715all] uglies?</p>  
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I know your time is valuable and all I have to pay you with is this silver coin.</p>

          <p>Whew! That's a load off of my mind. I know you'll do a good job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thinning out the Flame Tribe on either Krotan Rock or Kysis Isle should keep them back from the Ridge of Latesran.</p>

          <p>Just killing nineteen [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_Tauric_38_An] or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_Tauric_38_An] would help a lot.</p>
