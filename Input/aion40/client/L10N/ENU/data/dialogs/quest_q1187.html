          <p>Yeah, most don't. I tell you, removing the MP increase manastone is the most difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not just for me--I've heard others complain about it, too! We keep breaking them, and now we're running out.... It's the dirty little secret the Manastone Removers Association doesn't want you to know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Evasion and Parry manastones give us trouble, too. Say...do you have time to get some MP +30, Evasion +6, and Parry +14 manastones for us? I'd give you another in return!</p>

          <p>Manastone Removers use a different method for each manastone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Removing MP manastones is trickier than HP manastones and often results in breakage. As a result, the demand for the MP, Evasion, and Parry manastones is high.</p>
