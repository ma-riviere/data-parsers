          <p>Elysea thinks it is my enemy, and I've killed enough Elyos that I understand their thinking. I am their enemy, but Elysea is not my enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Inhibition is my enemy. Morals can bind and restrict action, suffocating the clear, perfect, genuine strength to do what must be done. What they are afraid to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos do not understand, and so waves and waves of them will come...and die. Many Asmodians don't understand, either.</p>

          <p>In war, what you call ruthlessness is only clarity...seeing clearly what must be done and doing it, decisively, quickly, and with open eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many moments for ruthless action. Red Hasia lacks that clarity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you understand? Are you strong enough to look upon the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_2730_LizardmanFi_26_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_2730_LizardmanAs_26_An]s with clear sight?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Beyond the Elyos, the Draconutes flock to fight me. They don't concern me much. But they may be the first step for you.</p>
