          <p>Ah, [%username]! May I ask another favor of you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I was distracted by...Zombie stench...a pack of Keratons started causing havoc around the Aetheric Field Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got the Observatory grounds covered, but we can't protect the villagers as they travel to and from the Observatory.</p>

          <p>Good, because I really need someone to go drive out those Keratons, but I can't spare anyone from Observatory protection duty right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've seen those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CatosRE_34_An]s attack before, haven't you? There's no way a villager could survive a full on charge.</p>

          <p>Well done. That should keep the population down for a while.</p>
