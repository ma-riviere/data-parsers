          <p>Beautiful, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>It's the water, I think. The waves gently lapping at my feet, and the sound of the crashing waves...so relaxing.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I've heard stories, though, that the Cantas Coast was one of the main attractions of Verteron, famous for its clear waters, beautiful sunsets, and Afari fishing.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Hardly any left now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Starturtle_19_n]s. They're clumsy beasts and they devour the Veneras and Afari. With no natural predators, their numbers grow and the problem is exacerbated.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to reduce the numbers of Starturtles to protect the area, but I need help. Perhaps from someone like you?</p>

          <p>Thank you, friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may seem like a strange idea, but killing the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Starturtle_19_n]s will save the ecosystem here. And we must do it before breeding season, or it will quickly get out of hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go, [%userclass]. Kill twelve Starturtles, then come back once you're finished. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>Gen was worried that the Sea Starturtles were endangering the Afari, a rare species of fish, by eating too many of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He killed many of them, but could not eliminate them all by himself. You agreed to help hunt Starturtles before they had a chance to breed.</p>
