          <p>That the Undead in The Storm Circle and Nolantis Altar appeared because of the Cursed Obelisk is an important discovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That Bollvig turned them into such creatures--yet another reason he must be stopped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We should at least free the Elyos under his control.</p>

          <p>We can't wait--under Bollvig's leadership, the Undead will soon mount an all-out attack.</p>

          <p>All of Heiron should know this as soon as possible. We must alert the fortress, Arbolu's Haven, and Jeiaparan Village.</p>

          <p>Bollvig? Obelisk of the Curse? I wasn't in Heiron at the time, but I did hear about it. Neither the fortress nor Sanctum responded to the situation effectively.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Bollvig's story is a sad one--I admit that--but still we must prepare for his attack and send him and his army of Undead back to the flow of Aether if we can.</p>
