          <p>You there! Have you been to Anturoon Crossing recently? A friend of mine, Mijou, was supposed to visit me today. I'm desperate for her help, but it turns out she can't make it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mijou told me I should keep an eye out for someone called...what was it?...[%username]? Yes, something like that.</p>

          <p>Really? [%username] the [%userclass]? My name is Jephani.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not normally stationed here, but I'm on a crucial task. I can't do my duty alone, and with no sign of Mijou...you might be able to help me, right? That's what Mijou's messenger said.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can promise a lucrative reward if you help me. But before I tell you what needs doing, I need you to promise to keep this whole thing to yourself.</p>

          <p>It's Ulgorn. He's sick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's been hiding it for months now, but his fits of pain are getting heavier and more frequent. Two weeks ago, he'd just grimace and go quiet. But yesterday, I had to hold him so he wouldn't collapse in the middle of camp. The air went out of him like he was being punched in the stomach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a medicine I can make, but to make it I need three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2124a]s and three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2124b]s. Unfortunately, the Amphas and Sparkles defend themselves very well, so I haven't been able to mix up the medicine.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]! Mijou was right to recommend you for this.</p>

          <p>If you fail, and Ulgorn's illness becomes public knowledge, it could lead to a bloody--not to mention lengthy--power struggle for control of the raiders. Factions would declare for themselves, and all of Ishalgen would fall into chaos.</p>

          <p>It seems in the absence of the willing I must either do this job myself, or die trying. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], please reconsider. If you won't do it for Ulgorn, do it for those of us who respect him.</p>

          <p>Oh thank Azphel! Now I can start making Ulgorn's medicine, and maybe--just maybe--he'll get better. I'd hate to see the raiders tear themselves apart, and I'd hate to lose Ulgorn even more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll make sure Ulgorn knows who made this treatment possible. He's a forthright man, and I'm sure he'll reward you well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime, please take this as a sign of my own appreciation.</p>

You agreed to help cure his condition, and collected Sparkle legs and Ampha thorns, both of which are apparently needed to restore Ulgorn's health. Once you had the ingredients, you took them back to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Djuefene].</p>
