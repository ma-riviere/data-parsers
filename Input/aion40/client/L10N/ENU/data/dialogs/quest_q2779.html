          <p>Something's been bothering me. Well, I should say two somethings--at the Elyos guard tower near our fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought I must have been mistaken at first. No Elyos would show their pretty faces here unless they were out of their minds... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've caught them watching me, though.</p>

          <p>I know! One minute they seemed to be watching me, then they'd just vanish. I can't even sleep, they're just creeping me out so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My commander thinks they're just well-trained scouts observing our movements, but I think it's something more personal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go teach a lesson to those annoying glowworms? I don't ever want to see them around the fortress again.</p>
