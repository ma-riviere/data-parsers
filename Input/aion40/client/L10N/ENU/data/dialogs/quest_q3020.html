          <p>They were lush forests, once, filled with Elim. But the Dragon Lord Fregion cursed this land--to this day, it's surrounded by flames. It's a wasteland.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Elim were transformed. Now they roam the region as Rotrons and Agrints--monsters.</p>

          <p>Sanctum's tried everything, but nothing's worked so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had to abandon a research camp there. The heat's unbearable, and the Agrints and Rotrons made it impossible to stay. They shake their burning branches and attack anything that moves. And it's getting worse.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Take a Stone of Purification just in case. I haven't seen him since I left, and I don't know how he's fared since then.</p>

          <p>Tartagan had lost his reason to his transformation, so you fed him a Stone of Purification. He told you that Fire Spirits were born from Flame Crystals and begged you to help stop it.</p>
