          <p>Interested in making a bit of Kinah on the side?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got a deal for you. It needs to be kept quiet, though, or the others will cash in on my little idea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, this is gonna make us a lot of money, but I ain't messin' around--this has to be hush-hush, even from the other raiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whaddaya say, [%userclass]?</p>

          <p>Here's the deal. There are all kinds of nasties up in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA187]. It's so rough up there that most raiders won't go near the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me though, I ain't scared of ghost stories, and I ain't gonna hesitate when there's money to be made.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mentioning "ghosts" got your attention, huh? That graveyard is full of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GhostD_7_An]s, former residents of Pandaemonium with lots of fancy clothes and jewelry. See where I'm going with this?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rumor has it that there's even a dead Elyos wandering around. I bet he's got some fancy trinkets on him....</p>

          <p>The "loot" ain't much use to them, is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I gotta warn you...those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GhostD_7_An]s aren't pushovers. The only reason I'm telling you about the job is because I've seen you crackin' skulls, and I figure you ain't afraid of ghosts either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The job is simple. Go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA187], kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GhostD_7_An]s, and steal the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2003A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get on with it, [%userclass]. It's only a matter of time until the others find out and do a bit of late night shoppin' of their own.</p>

          <p>Most folks would die to get their hands on these...get it? Ah, never mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These are great. Good to know they ain't lost their luster after spending so long in such a shabby place. I can turn these into Kinah, no question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems like I should find some more jobs for you, eh? This could be a real rewarding partnership.</p>
