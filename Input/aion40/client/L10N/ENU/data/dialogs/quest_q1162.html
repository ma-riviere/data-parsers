          <p>I used to have men following me around all the time, [%username]. They all wanted to marry me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I said no to all of them. I wanted to marry the right person. Then along came [%dic:STR_DIC_LA14]. He had such a gentle way about him and yet he wasn't afraid to work for a living.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't guess we were married to look at us, would you? He's way over there. He's studying to be a Soul Healer. He's thrown his heart into it, and now there's none left for me.</p>

          <p>No, you're right, but...he's studying so hard that I rarely see him, and he talks of nothing but Aether and channelling and psychic trauma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then he lost his wedding ring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I noticed that his finger had been bare for a few days, and when I asked, he said he'd lost it in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA11]!</p>
