          <p>While you were dealing with Kerubiels, [%username], someone from Jeiaparan Village came to see Soul Healer Mirborante.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I overheard "Kerubiels," so I talked to the villager myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She said she thinks the Kerubiels have left their usual habitat because of some oddly decayed trees.</p>

          <p>Decayed, poisoned, contaminated...I don't know. But the trees showed up in the Gloomy Mire, and the Kerubiels are being led away by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Cherubim4_33_An]s.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much. Without their bullying leaders, the other Kerubiels should keep their distance.</p>

          <p>Rahelio learned that Kerubiels came to the Observatory because they were driven out from the Gloomy Mire. He asked you to eliminate Kerubiel Looters that are leading the pack.</p>
