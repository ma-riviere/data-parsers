          <p>Welcome to another great Daeva's Day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, I hear the Elyos celebrate it too. I bet they think we just grunt and pound rocks together to have fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But let's not think about such unpleasant things as Elyos. We're here to have fun! Would you like to participate in an event?</p>

          <p>It's a scavenger hunt...though since we're Asmodian, it also involves hunting and killing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sounds like fun, doesn't it? And you get a prize too: a special Heart Headband.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why not join up? It's free, and you'll get a workout, to boot.</p>

          <p>To get the Heart Headband, you need to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80005a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're attached to [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_15_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RatmanWarriorM_11_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AElemental2ndD_18_An]s, so you'll have to kill them first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't expect that to be a problem to you. Then, when you have enough, just trade them in to me for a Heart Headband. Sounds good?</p>

          <p>Have fun with your exclusive Daeva's Day Heart Headband!</p>

          <p>I suggest wearing one the next time you fight an Elyos or Balaur. That'll show them just what Asmodae thinks of them!</p>
