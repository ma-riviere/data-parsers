          <p>Ever heard of a Daeva named Gilbey, [%username]? He's a fellow Centurion, and one of my best friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He and some others were sent on a mission recently. They all came back via Obelisk, severely injured, Gilbey in particular.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And he's no Elroco, either. He's huge, strong, smart. But even he and his fellows were no match for...</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDF3_DrakanFiBossD_50_Ah]. He took out some of the finest Sanctum had to offer, apparently without breaking a sweat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gilbey's recovered since then, as have his comrades.... Physically, at least. But they're still scarred mentally; the defeat still haunts them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't bear to see my dear friend suffer like this. I have to avenge him, and ease his pain, by getting rid of Bakarma once and for all. Can you help me?</p>

          <p>Thank you. This has been weighing heavily on my mind ever since I last saw him.</p>

          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDF3_DrakanFiBossD_50_Ah] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_H]. But heed my story's warning: he will not be easy to defeat.</p>

          <p>You have a hard heart, Daeva. I thought you'd understand what Gilbey and his comrades are going through.</p>

          <p>I just realized something: what I asked you to do might make Gilbey feel worse, by succeeding where he failed.</p>

          <p>I don't think I care, though. I'm doing this for me as much as for him. No one hurts my friends that way and gets away with it.</p>

          <p>Well done. I hope this makes Gilbey feel better. Or at least gets him to stop brooding.</p>

          <p>It's definitely a weight off my mind. I can feel my frustration and hatred draining away.</p>

          <p>This is for you. Think of it as a physical token of my gratitude.</p>

          <p>Guardian Klaus's friend was brooding over a defeat by Commander Bakarma. He wanted you to finish the job, partly as revenge and partly to lift his friend's spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You thus went to Draupnir Cave, killed Commander Bakarma, and returned to tell the tale. He was very much pleased at the hope his friend would stop despairing.</p>
