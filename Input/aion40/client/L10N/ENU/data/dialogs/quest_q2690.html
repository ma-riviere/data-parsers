          <p>You came at the right time, [%username]. I need a Daeva to infiltrate Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A while back I heard a Daeva who'd gone to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_003] in Heiron report that he saw something strange there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He claimed that in a place called Cursed Ancient Temple he saw a monster called Deshirung the Blimp that cried out "Lumiel! Lumiel!"</p>

          <p>Indeed. Another Daeva who had been there before that reported that he saw a relief of Lord Lumiel on the wall of a ruined building near the Cursed Ancient Temple. At that time, I didn't have time to think much about it. But this time...well the report was quite specific.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received an order from Pandaemonium via the fortress to verify the story.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that ruin turns out to be a pre-Cataclysm temple to Empyrean Lord Lumiel, it is of vast importance.</p>

          <p>So, I want you, [%username], to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_name]. I would dearly love to go there myself but I can't risk the ire of the Archon of Dusk, the Shadow Court, or the Drakan Punisher Legion.</p>

          <p>The Cursed Ancient Temple is in the Lepharist Research Center. The report said there were carved stones everywhere. You need to make copies...perhaps by making a rubbing? Yes, that's it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you get the rubbings safely, bring them to Gunter--he's an antique document restoration expert. Understood?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dewi] first. He give you explicit directions to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_003] in Heiron.</p>

          <p>Ah! Travel to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_003] requires a rift. The one in Alquimia Approach will get you there. The Lepharists use that rift to travel to Elysea as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get approach, go straight up, and you'll see the passage through which the Lepharists send supplies to the Abyss. The rift appears near there. It's not always open, though, so don't miss it.</p>
