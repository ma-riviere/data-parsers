          <p>Hey, you! Have you seen a recipe? It's around here somewhere...argh. This is so frustrating. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently we're a bit too provincial here for the Blue Fleet. They're used to city food. I'm trying to accommodate them, but I haven't cooked any of this food in a long time.</p>

          <p>Marinating the Basilisk Meat in Mudthorn Sap...Ah, I should have remembered. No wonder it was so tough! </p>

          <p>Hey, since you're here, could you get me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622b]? I need to try again, but I'm out of ingredients and if I'm not here to watch it, the bread will burn. If you'll do it, I'll give you the recipe as a reward. </p>

          <p>Thank you. 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622a]s and 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622b] should be enough for the fleet. I'll get everything else ready. Hurry back! </p>

          <p>But...this is an amazing recipe! Hardly anyone knows how to get Basilisk to be this tender! What do you mean you don't want to?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All right. I'll get some Blue Fleet sailors to handle it. In the meantime, is there something you wanted to buy?</p>
