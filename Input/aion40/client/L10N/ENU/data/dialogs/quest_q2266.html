          <p>The Lepharist Revolutionaries have been stirring up a lot more trouble recently, and it's really making me concerned. Of course, I can't show it--Daevas always have to keep their cool in front of Humans. A loss of morale would have a chilling effect on our citizens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As cool as the starry winds, my old mentor used to say. We have to keep a calm front around the Humans, even though we are constantly watching for danger. I just wish it were easier to do.</p>

          <p>These are the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_doc_quest_2266a], which Brigade General Suthran wants delivered to the Observatory. They're very important documents. He didn't give out any details, but they seems to plan an attack against the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], would you please take this to Neifenmer at the Observatory? I wouldn't trust this to just anyone. Remember, secrecy is of the utmost importance!</p>

          <p>You met Neifenmer, but he said that it should be delivered directly to Aurtri, the Aetheric Field Protector. So you went into the Observatory and delivered the order to her.</p>
