 			<p>It would be to both our advantage if you were to tell me when you had more manastones.</p>
 			<p> </p>
 			<p>I would hate to think you had more sets of MP +50, Evasion +10, and Parry +18 manastones, when clearly my associates and I can make such better use of them.</p>
 			<p> </p>
 			<p>So, do you have more now, or are you perhaps heading out to get them for us? There will, of course, be a reward.</p>
