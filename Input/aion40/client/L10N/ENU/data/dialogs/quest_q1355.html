          <p>It's been a long time since I've been in the field. I've studied the Kyola Temple for several lifetimes, but it's different in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm finding so many precious relics here at the temple. Experiencing history with my own eyes and hands.</p>

          <p>You...you found it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shh, Actaeon, Shh. This...this is exactly what Telemachus sent me here to find. This is the key to the Fire Temple in...Asmodae. Before Atreia was sundered, the two temples were linked. I should deliver this to the commander. He'll be pleased to have access to Asmodae directly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you sense the extraordinary energy of the key? It imprints upon anyone who carries it--even for a short time--access to the Fire Temple entrance deep in the basement of the Kyola Temple. You, [%username], won't need this key any longer.</p>
