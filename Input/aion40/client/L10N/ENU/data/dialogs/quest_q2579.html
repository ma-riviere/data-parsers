          <p>Ahem! I may be coming down with something. I feel a chill and keep getting these coughs. I wish I had some hot seafood soup to warm my insides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hot and spicy soup cooked with plump [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2579a]s and tender [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2579b]...oh that would be just the thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe it's because I don't have many days left to live, but I keep thinking back on the food my mother used to cook for me when I was a child. She made wonderful soup.</p>

          <p>You may find it hard to believe, but when I was young the Anair Ice Lake was teeming with Potcrabs and Lobnites. Its water was so clean back then...the Potcrabs we caught were sweet and plump. Six people could feast on just one steamed Potcrab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no delicacy could compare to my mother's Seafood Soup cooked with hot spices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Flavorful broth and plenty of meat! Oh, my mouth is watering.</p>
