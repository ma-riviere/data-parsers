          <p>Are you ready to step it up a notch?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have legions clearing away Ellie soldiers, and I'm proud of each and every one of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While the soldiers may be the arms and wings of the Elyos army, we aren't going to settle for the spindly limbs, we're going to take this war right to the brain!</p>

          <p>Ha! Without someone telling them what to do, those Elyos soldiers would just fold up and die. That's where the army officers come in--they give the orders to the lower Elyos troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take out their elite officers, and the remaining soldiers will be easy pickings. Our Asmodian battle prowess will teach their sun-addled brains a new lesson!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Those cowardly Ellie officers tend to congregate in groups, so take a few friends with you. Keep moving, and keep alert. Oh, and for Azphel's sake, only crack their skulls if their blood's worth spilling! Too many Asmodians consider all victories equal.</p>
