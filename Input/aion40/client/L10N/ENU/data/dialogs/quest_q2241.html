          <p>This canyon is the one place I can collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2241a]s. In daylight, they're quite plain, but at night, they have a ghostly shine to them--hence the name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're delicious, but more than that, they're curative. Mix them into a poultice, and a wound that might fester for weeks knits in a day or two!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very useful, very rare! I'm lucky to find even one in three days of searching.</p>

          <p>Well, I think I know why--I'm not the only one who's picking them!</p>

          <p>I see [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpriggD_15_n]s here in Gribade every day, digging up grubs to eat. But yesterday, one of them stopped his foraging and started dancing like a drunk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've never seen anything so strange in your life. And what had he been gobbling--Glowing Mushrooms!</p>

          <p>These mushrooms are much sought after, you know. Gourmets pay handsomely, and soldiers and scouts do as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've picked the place clean, I think. I haven't seen one for several days. But if the Spriggs are collecting them, they may still have some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'll kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpriggD_15_n]s and bring me any [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2241a]s you find, we'll split the profits!</p>
