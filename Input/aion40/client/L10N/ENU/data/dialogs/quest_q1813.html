          <p>Listen, I'm putting together an ambitious plan, and you're one of the people I'd like to recruit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kysis Fortress is a key choke point on the path to the Eye of Reshanta. We can't leave it enemy hands, as it is now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're building towards a counterattack to re-take it.</p>

          <p>While we lay the groundwork, our Guardians and Daevas are raiding enemy territory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need the enemy off balance so that when the main attack comes we can catch them out of position. The less it costs us to get the fortress, the stronger our hold on it will be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sending volunteers on diversionary missions today, running the Asmodians ragged. Would you like one, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Spirited! I like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said, my aim is to disrupt the Asmodians while they're consolidating their hold on the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Watch the situation, and set out for the Kysis Fortress when it switches to the vulnerable state. Engage the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1813_all] and take away their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1813a]. That should throw them off nicely.</p>
