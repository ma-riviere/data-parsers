          <p>I was never very interested in marriage, but now I'm even less so. Sinis the Black Widow killed four of her husbands to steal their assets. Dreadful, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was really meticulous. She flavored her stew with a poisonous mushroom, but not enough to kill right away. She fed it to her husbands every day. They became sick over time and eventually died, but it just looked like they'd been ill, not poisoned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what brings you here?</p>
