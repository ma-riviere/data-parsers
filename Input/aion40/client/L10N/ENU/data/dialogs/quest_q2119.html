          <p>Let's take a look at this map...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yep, that's Ishalgen. Look, here is the prison camp...and this is...wait, I've seen this map before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A woman named Kirtai came through here a couple months ago. She said she was looking for a gravesite and had a poorly drawn map.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told her to go to the graveyard if she was looking for a grave, but she insisted it was someplace else. For 200 Kinah I'd believe anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We never found it and she never came back, but she left the map. I kept it handy in case I saw her again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh no...</p>

          <p>I can do better than that. This map is onionskin, so I can just lay it atop the other.</p>
          <p> </p>     
          <p>It lines up perfectly! The Black Opal--and the gravesite Kirtai was looking for--is in a cave just over the hill. The Lepharists are close, but their map isn't detailed enough to show exactly where to go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's one problem, though: The cave isn't empty. You'll have to face [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KalnifNamed_8_An] to get to the Black Opal. We lost a lot of raiders trying to kill Carak, but I'm sure you can do it, [%username]! Imagine the treasure...the stuff dreams are made of!</p>
