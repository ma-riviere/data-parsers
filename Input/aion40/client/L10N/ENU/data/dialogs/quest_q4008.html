          <p>Hey there...I bet I can stump you at "Brusthonin trivia!" Wanna play? Of course you do! All right, answer this question: What are the most dangerous undead at Havenjark Farm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give up? Of course you do. Get ready....it's the Porgus. Can you believe it? Undead Porguses wandering around. It'd be funny if...well, okay, it is sort of funny once you get past the horror. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it turns out, an undead Porgus carries horrific diseases. The last team that tried to cultivate near the Porgus succumbed to vile diseases within a week.</p>

          <p>Yes, it is! [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadPorgussD_23_An]es keep looking for food just as they did in life. They stick their undead Porgus parts in the dirt and the water, contaminating and infecting everything they touch. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't dare send settlers to Havenjark Farm while they live. That's where you come in, naturally.</p>

          <p>I'm not asking you to kill all the Porgus--that would be too much. Just clear some of them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Havenjark Farm, and get rid of a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadPorgussD_23_An] or ten.</p>

          <p>We've come here with the dream of restoring Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That dream is imperiled by these undead...Porgus. They're too much for our forces, but our forces are just Human. It's understandable if unfortunate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You, on the other hand, admit to being outmatched by reanimated expired sandwich meat on the hoof? That's...possibly funnier than undead Porgus are just by themselves. Pathetic and sad, but funny.</p>
