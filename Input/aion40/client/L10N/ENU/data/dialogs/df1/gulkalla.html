          <p>I can't sleep. Too many delays on rebuilding Impetusium. Too much criticism from Brigade General Suthran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I expected hardships, but never this much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know the Asmodian way--to turn each hardship into an opportunity to grow stronger. But I wonder whether these walls will ever stand again.</p>

          <p>After all, rebuilding Impetusium will provide people across Asmodae with hope...and hope is in short supply around here, eh?</p>
