          <p>Before you raiders arrived, I lived in peace. The only disturbance was the occasional traveler wanting his fortune told. I could wander Ishalgen as I pleased.</p>    
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, because of you curs, I live this hermit life. If I leave this shack, my things disappear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just last week someone stole a silver necklace from my cupboard. I can't leave my own home without losing the rest of my meager possessions.</p>

          <p>Other than you and your raider friends, who else would steal from my home? Ribbits? Daru?</p>

          <p>The stench of your ignorance is overpowering. Get downwind from me, before I make you regret coming to pester me!</p>

          <p>You became a Daeva after all! Yet you return to mingle with these raiders?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently Daevas understand things that I cannot. I will submit to your higher wisdom, Daeva.</p>      
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I suspect you're here because you miss your own Humanity. You may live through eternity, but knowing what it is to be alive--alive in the ordinary sense--will give you fuel to fight.</p>
