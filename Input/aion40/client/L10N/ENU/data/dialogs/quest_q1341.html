          <p>I used to make small trinkets for children. Bracelets, that sort of thing. I've looked for materials out here, but they're scarce.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On my last patrol, I saw a lot of Basilisk and Scolopen bodies. I could make some good toys and trinkets out of them, I think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1341b]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1341a]s?</p>
