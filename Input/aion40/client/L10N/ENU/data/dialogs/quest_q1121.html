          <p>It's my prayer bracelet--I've lost several  beads from it. I can't believe I was so stupid!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was out patrolling the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA06]% when I noticed the cord was broken and the beads had slipped off! I retraced my route and found all but three of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I found the last one in the shrubs...with a hungry Sparkle gnawing on it!</p>

          <p>That was my guess too! Anyway, I suspect the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA44]%s and [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA13_6]%s ate the last three.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A priest from [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07] gave that bracelet to me personally. It's hugely important to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, [%username]. Would you hunt Sparkles and Sparkies until you find those last three beads?</p>
