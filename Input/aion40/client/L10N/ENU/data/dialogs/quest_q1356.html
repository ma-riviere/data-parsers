          <p>I've been working up courage to give it to Actaeon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What is it? Oh, just a small Gourd Bottle I discovered on patrol. See these lovely engravings? It may be one of the ancient relics Actaeon's looking for.</p>

          <p>I met Actaeon while serving at Kyola Temple, and we became friends. I was surprised someone so kind and charming would be out here in the wastes. Archaeologists are usually a little...fussy, but he's so good-tempered!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I became a Golden Bough Legionary, he envied my access to the Eracus Temple Cavern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I decided I'd give him anything I find that's beneath the Legion's notice but that might be of interest to him.</p>

          <p>Then I discovered this Gourd Bottle. I want to give it to him, but what if he dislikes it?</p>

          <p>Besides, I have no excuses to go to the Kyola Temple.</p>
