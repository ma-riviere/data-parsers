          <p>I'm so tired of people who expect to become Alchemists overnight without putting in the work. That type never succeeds--Alchemy is not an easy craft.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least you seem to be different from that rabble, but I must test you to determine if you have real talent.</p>

          <p>Then make Diana's Noble Spellbook and bring it to me. Making such a thing requires more than talent. You'll also need some luck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, you should also know this up front: if you agree to become an Alchemy Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So please consider carefully before you answer.</p>

          <p>You can buy the Diana's Noble Spellbook design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Darius]. It's a more complicated design than the one for [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1980].</p>
