          <p>It is exciting to find and learn about all these Asmodian plants. But some days it's hard to be so far from home. I usually don't mind the solitude, but going too long without my family, my friends and my...my.... </p>

          <p>I...I do miss Jinus in Sanctum. The very thought of never seeing his face again....</p>

          <p>Obviously I can't go back to see him while I'm still working here, and I wouldn't dream of asking him to come to Asmodae. But if you could take him a gift from me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a plant around here called Theonia. Asmodians usually eat its roots, but its leaves are much more delicious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to make sugar-encrusted fruits for Jinus, when I was in Elysea. I'd like to make something similar from [%dic:STR_DIC_E_herb_d_n_c_20a]. Would you gather some for me, [%username]?</p>
