          <p>Welcome to Akarios Village, [%userclass]. I'm Daines, and I'm responsible for all long distance teleportation. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I send Daevas to all kinds of exotic locations. For a fee, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should speak to Kustanon, if you're looking for local transportation.</p>

          <p>I see a great deal of ambition in your eyes. You're hoping to visit our great city of Sanctum, aren't you? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only those chosen for immortality by our Seraphim Lords can use my teleportation device. I think it best to not build your hopes up, you must remember that Humans play a smaller role in this world than our great Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take one day at a time, do your best, and one day you'll be able to look back and see all the great things you've achieved. </p>
