          <p>Those damned fragments!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>The blasted bits threaten us all...and so few of us can do anything about them.</P>

          <p>Yes? What is it, [%userclass]? I'm a busy man: I don't have time to chat while those fragments threaten Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today I destroyed thirty-seven of them! That's thirty-seven lives saved, and yet as I stand here talking to you, more fragments are forming. Of course we try and keep this phenomena relatively quiet from the residents. It'll only unsettle them more than they already are, and Ariel knows...the last thing we need in these times is more to worry about.</p>    
          <p> </p>    
          <p>If you have nothing you wish to ask me, then please be on your way. Those fragments won't smash themselves.</p>

          <p>Well, I guess I COULD do with a few more moments' rest.</p>

          <p>The power of flight is one of the many gifts a Daeva receives upon ascension. Mastering flight is absolutely crucial, as it is a key aspect of all Legion operations, especially within the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>The Asmodians, curse them, have somehow managed to adapt extremely well to the skies. It is our responsibility, our mission, to understand flight as well as they do. Only then may we survive this challenge.</P>
