          <p>You're so lucky to be out on field missions. All I do is stand here and guard the village from attack.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I'd rather be out there, honing my skills on those Kerubs....</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Well, I can't complain that much. I get paid the same, and a job like this means the Captain trusts my skills.</P>

          <p>[%username]? That you? You look fantastic! One of the perks of ascension, I suppose.</p>

          <P>I suppose you'll be leaving us now to go fight in the war? Well, if I ever ascend too, I'll be sure and look you up first thing.</P>
