	  <p>I assume you are here to investigate the Krall Outpost, [%username]? Be warned--the Krall are not as stupid as they first seem. Though their skulls are thick and their movements cumbersome, they belie an opportunistic nature that can catch even a seasoned Daeva off-guard.</p>

	  <p>Never drop your guard, never assume anything, and always watch your back.</p>
	  <p> </p>
	  <p>Follow those three rules and you'll be an awful lot safer than most of the fools I've seen wander in there.</p>
