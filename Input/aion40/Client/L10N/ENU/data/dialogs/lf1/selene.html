          <p>May Ariel protect and guide you, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've recently heard a rumor--only through the waggling of idle tongues, mind--that a savior is coming. A great hero, born to mark the dawn of a new age.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...I shouldn't listen to this kind of talk. Hope is worth nothing when it is built on loose talk. The dreams of a stargazing people...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell me, Daeva, what do you think of this rumor?</p>

          <p>Ah... In this case, let me speak with you a moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a hobby, I collect antiques, relics of an illustrious past. I have seen with my own eyes the treasures of noble, historic Daevas, held in my hands the relics of Empyrean legend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Amongst these priceless objects, inscriptions of prophecy are rare yet I have come across them, and they sometimes intrude on my thoughts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But these objects are antiquities. Their only real value is in carrying the past into the future. Nothing more.</p>

          <p>Yes, people should always be suspicious of the truth they wish for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give a supposed prophet a formation of clouds, or the shadows of a rock face and they'll claim to find something in it. Prophecy is indeed the realm of the fool. And worse, the charlatan who senses Kinah in the needs of the weak-minded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is the nature of the Elyos. We are a noble, blessed people, but given to dreaming.</p>
