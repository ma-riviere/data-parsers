          <p>Ah, not a simple question to answer, I'm afraid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Obelisks are made from Aetheric Ore, a metal with many divine properties. How it works exactly, none but the smartest Daeva could say....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But as to what it does, it stores a sort of imprint of the souls of those around it. Should your soul become impure, it could restore it to purity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One may also bind here, allowing you to call yourself back here through the Aetheric currents.</p>

          <p>If you are bound here, should you find yourself on the brink of death, Aion's mercy will recall you to the obelisk.</p>

          <p>Though the Obelisk may save your life, the experience will mar your soul.</p>

          <p>Those who are close to death may have their souls erode away. While your soul is injured, you will be slower, weaker, and forgetful.</p>

          <p>With my services, of course, you can restore your soul to purity.</p>
