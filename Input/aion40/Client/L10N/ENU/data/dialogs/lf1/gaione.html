          <p>Well, perhaps not eloquent but by the light above us, please don't hurt me!</p>

          <p>I was once a Guardian. Don't laugh, it's not funny. I know, it's hard to believe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This ugly, hoofed, wingless body is a punishment wrought upon me by a high-ranking Daeva of Sanctum. He decreed that I must live out my years as a Tog.</p>

          <p>I was assigned to watch the Krall at the Elpheus Dock--a crucial responsibility. But I was bored. Nothing ever happened on my watch! So I let my guard down just once and fell asleep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just then, the Krall launched a vicious attack--I think they must have been watching me. I made one stupid mistake, and have been paying for it ever since. Just look at me! I'm ridiculous! Oh, my wings!</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>I may as well make the best of it; feeling sorry for myself won't help. Besides, Togs really like hunting Potcrabs--they're crunchy!</p>
