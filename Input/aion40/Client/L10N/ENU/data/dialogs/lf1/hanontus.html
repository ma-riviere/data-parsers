          <p>I'm glad to hear it. Plenty of things have been going missing recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to have ten bowls in the house. Now I've got only a couple. I'm not a rich man. I can't afford to keep buying things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems obvious there's a thief operating in the area. But why would anyone want to steal bowls?</p>
