          <p>Our enemies would love to get a crack at this area. We can never let that happen, of course. This is where [%dic:STR_DIC_LA38] monitors the Aetheric Field, makes sure that it doesn't become too unstable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Really, this site was built around her, to focus and magnify her talents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's very sensitive to the flow of Aetheric energy. She says she can hear it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are very fortunate to have her. She dedicates her abilities to the service of Elysea. Sometimes I worry that she'll push herself too far. She must be cared for just as she cares for the Aetheric Field.</p>

          <p>Ahhh... Even after her ascension, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA38] didn't realize the full extent of her ability. She had no clue how important a part she would come to play in our defense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That sound, the voice of the Aether, had called to her for many years but she didn't understand what it was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was Kaisinel, the Seraphim Lord of Illusion, who helped her to come to terms with her power. With this divine guidance, she was able to forge herself into a powerful instrument of protection. Ever since, Elysea has been immeasurably safer.</p>
