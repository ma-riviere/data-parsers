          <p>The Aetheric Field is growing subtly weaker, Daeva. It gives me grave concern.</p>

          <p>Do you understand what we're monitoring here? The Aetheric Field is a barrier which protects the Aetheric energy of all Elysea. Like a wineskin, it contains the Aether within it, preventing its escape.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without the Aether, the Daeva are powerless. Their abilities all derive from it...including their immortality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Aether were ever to be lost, the lives of all Daeva would be in danger.</p>

          <P>I fear that it could. The Aetheric Field has been growing steadily weaker since before I've been stationed here.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <p>Lord Kaisinel has been informed. So far, he does not seem to have a plan to counter it, and that makes me uneasy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>All that we can do is to continue this war. We must drive back the Balaur and the Asmodians at all costs, and pray that we can buy ourselves enough time.</P>
