          <p>This is the busiest time ever . Do this, do that, don't do this, don't do that... this Shugo needs a break. Just a little one. Tiny break, to rest the eyes.</p>

          <p>Supervisor Numonerk is...very good, kind person. Ask him, he'll tell you himself! He would never carry whip around...never threaten poor workers with it...no, no...</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Daeva, let me assure you, this whip that Supervisor Numonerk does not have, its handle is not studded with Odium. No, no...quite impossible.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Supervisor Numonerk makes sure we are fed and paid well. Supervisor Numonerk is like a father to us all...a hero. What would we do without Supervisor Numonerk?</P>
