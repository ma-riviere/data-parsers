          <p>Sorry to bother you, Daeva, but you didn't come from Verteron Citadel, did you? My father lives there, and I don't get to see him very often--not since I moved.</p>

          <p>I just needed a quieter, more secluded place for my studies. The Citadel is great, but there's just too much hustle and bustle there for me to really concentrate properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tolbas Village is a relatively peaceful place, and my uncle's farm is just a minute away. I've asked my father to move here countless times, but he says he'll miss the citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I can do is send him the occasional letter these days. It's not much, but I don't want to lose touch with him completely.</p>
