          <p>Haha! But I can't stay here like this forever. So, I've decided to make a sleeping bag.</p>

          <p>I think that Crasaur Leather and Brax Skin are the best materials around here.</p>

          <p>Please hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BraxD_21_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_PhainiD_22_n]s and bring me their skins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With a bag made from those materials, I can keep an eye on Spedor in comfort.</p>

          <p>I guess you think I'm pathetic. Someone who hasn't done anything to aid Asmodae in the war!</p>

          <p>But you know what? I was once quite famous in Reshanta. They call it the never-ending battle for a reason. I served Atreia for longer than you've been alive!</p>
