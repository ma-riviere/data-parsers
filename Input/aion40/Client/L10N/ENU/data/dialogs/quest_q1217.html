          <p>You know, [%username], there's a local myth that surrounds this coast. Sirens singing out to sailors and the like, hence "Cantas."</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I never bought much into the stories, but it would explain why all these boxes ended up in the water here.</p>

          <p>Well, of course, the Sirens would lure the sailors close to the rocks, where the ships would break apart and sink.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hundreds of ships, thousands of people--all gone. Tragic if it's true, but either way, we're left to deal with the flotsam here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Creatures seem to have taken up in several of the boxes, too. Say, could you help me out?</p>

          <p>Splendid! Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask because the creatures hiding in those boxes are far too vicious for a Human to tackle. I couldn't ask anyone other than a Daeva for help with this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please clear away twelve of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mimic_19_n]es. It doesn't matter if they have creatures inside or not--I just want the area cleared of them.</p>

          <p>Ah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I thought a simple cleaning request might be beneath a Daeva. The problem is those creatures--they're too strong for Humans.</p>      
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll make some other arrangements. Thank you for your time.</p>
