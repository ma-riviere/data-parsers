          <p>In Elysea, the ghosts and shades stay to the dark places underground, and hide their faces from the living.</p>

          <p>In the Abyss, they attack everything that moves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is as if they resent the heat and warmth of the living, and seek to extinguish it wherever they find it.</p>
