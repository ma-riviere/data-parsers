          <p>Azphelumbra! [%username], you've come far from your...ahem...humble beginnings. Getting here required skill and determination honed on the anvil of hardship. You have become a powerful weapon for the battle ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've proven that you have the backbone and courage to fight. Know that such travails are nothing compared to the arduous battles you will face in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet, you've made it this far, Daeva. Do you have what it takes to engage in constant battle against the sun-besotted Elyos and the blasted Balaur? Will you persevere?</p>

          <p>Excellent! You'll require a strong will to undertake these missions. I'll expect your diligence and devotion, as the stakes are high. Defeat means the loss of Asmodae and death to all Asmodians.</p>
