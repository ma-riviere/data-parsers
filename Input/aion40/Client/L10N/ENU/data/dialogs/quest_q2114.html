          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MutaD_4_n] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_spakyD_5_n]s have been breeding like crazy across Moslan Forest. And their main food source? Tree sap!</p>

          <p>Even though Sparkies don't drink sap as quickly as Sylphen, they're larger and probably consume much more over their lifespan.</p>
