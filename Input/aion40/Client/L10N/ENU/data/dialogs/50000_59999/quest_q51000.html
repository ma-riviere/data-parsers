          <p>I heard a scholar say a while back that before the Cataclysm, Atreia was temperate all year. Never too hot or too cold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess that's something else that we lost when the Tower of Eternity was destroyed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems every summer gets hotter and hotter. Some Daevas are even coming down with heat sickness. Something has to be done.</p>

          <p>That's what Daevas of Summer are dedicated to finding out. But it's definitely not easy. You can't exactly dissect or question heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is a way to seal actual summer heat into a physical object, called Scorching Heat. It was discovered by a Daeva named Sihein.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You seem like the curious type. Why don't you go to Pandaemonium and find out if he's made any further progress?</p>

          <p>I hear [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sihein] loves summer even more than most. I'm sure he'll love to talk with you about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you find out a way to help him with his research, it could benefit us all. If the heat gets any worse....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just be sure not to overexert yourself. We don't want to lose another Daeva to this weather.</p>

          <p>Is the heat getting to be too much for you? Hmm, you do look a little flushed. And you're not sweating much. That's a bad sign.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may be immortal, but you're still vulnerable to sickness and exhaustion. Too many Daevas forget that, push themselves too hard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You really should get into the shade, maybe lie down for a while. Do you want me to get you a Daeva of Nursing?</p>

          <p>Isn't this heat wonderful? The way it drifts off every surface, into your every pore? Of course, too much of even a good thing can be dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's one reason I found a way to coalesce it into Scorching Heat. It's much easier to study and organize when you can see and feel it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's also easier to transport, so I can examine heat from across Asmodae. That's why I helped organize a special event.</p>

          <p>I've spread the magic that creates Scorching Heat across all worlds. That way, anyone can collect them and bring them in for study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To encourage Daevas to do so, I've partnered with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Elma] to give summer-themed rewards in exchange for Scorching Heats.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be sure to talk to her and get yours. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll let myself bake in this marvelous warmth a while more....</p>
