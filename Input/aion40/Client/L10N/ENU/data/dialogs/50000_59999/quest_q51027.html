          <p>This spirit was an attempt to clone my mind and soul. But something's gone wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's become its own entity. Not only that, I we're bonded in a way that I can feel it growing weaker. I need a new transformation formula to keep the spirit from fizzling out!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The primary ingredient for the transformation is Soul Vigor. If you could find five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]s, I can test my formula.</p>

          <p>Have you brought that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This the first ingredient of the transformation that will change this Fizzling Spirit into an everlasting Great Spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need more Soul Vigor than any other ingredient. Multiple experiments will be needed before I'm ready to use it on the Fizzling Spirit, so the more you bring me, the better. I don't want to make this same mistake again.</p>

          <p>This Soul Vigor is enough for one test, and I must conduct several experiments to verify my formula.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this is successful, then the Fizzling Spirit will become an eternal Spirit of Fire!</p>
