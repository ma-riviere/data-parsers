          <p>Sure, we were reckless, but brothers are always reckless! We simply... used the wrong substances in our transformation attempt, and now I've turned my brother into a Talon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I've finally found the formula that will allow me to correct our mistakes and restore his body! All I need is the primary ingredient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need is called [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]. I just need five of them to complete my formula.</p>

          <p>Have you brought five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]s with you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a vital ingredient in restoring my brother, so the more you bring, the better. I'll need multiple experiments to confirm stability before I use this on my brother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't make the same mistake again.</p>

          <p>Five pieces of Soul Vigor will allow me to do one test of the formula. Alchemy is not magic, it is science. Only precise testing can prove it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this is successful, my brother will return to his original state.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for delivering the ingredients to me.</p>
