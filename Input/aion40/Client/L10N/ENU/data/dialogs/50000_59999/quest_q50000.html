          <p>Ah, greetings, [%username]. What comes to mind when I say summer?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The warm glow of Aether in the air? Fresh fruit and cool tea? The crisp blue beaches of Elysea? Sleeping under the stars?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of these things, right? Me too. Summer is just one big hot furnace! A three-month-long furnace!</p>

          <p>I should love summer--I was born in summer, even ascended in summer! But that doesn't mean I like the heat. Standing here in this blazing sunlight...my energy dwindles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can see you sweating, too, [%username]. You're cooking in that armor of yours! But I know a secret....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can turn this heat into...cool passion! I know the Daeva who does it, too. Just imagine turning this Ariel-forsaken heat into...you know what I'm talking about! Interested?</p>

          <p>I figured you might be. Head to Sanctum and meet with Daeva of Summer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cartiros].</p>

          <p>He knows every trick in the book about staying cool during this season.</p>

          <p>The Aether seems to heat up the air more than ever now, [%username].</p>

          <p>Some say it's due to Atreia's overpopulation in recent years, but I think it's those damn knuckle-draggers and their pollution. Asmodians are filthy, after all.</p>

          <p>You may not understand how the two can be connected, but [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zena] can fill you in.</p>

          <p>I know, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zena] is the person to see for that. She can turn the blazing heat of summer into something a whole lot cooler for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She calls it the Summer Swap...it's like her once-a-year sale. Go to Zena and trade the heat you collected with her, [%username].</p>

          <p>She'll exchange it for something a lot cooler.</p>
