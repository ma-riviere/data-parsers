          <p>We thought that it'd be easy to get to her Refuge from the Stronghold, but we now realize it isn't physically connected. At least we know how to get up there now. I just wish I knew where this information came from. I hope it isn't a trap.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also hope we can get up there before you lose your nerve.</p>
