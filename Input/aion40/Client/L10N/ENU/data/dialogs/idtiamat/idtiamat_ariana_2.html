          <p>We've been mapping Tiamat Stronghold, so let me tell you what we know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The various Legions have Command Centers here: Tahabata to the north, and Laksyaka to the east.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also in the east is the Military Ward, and finally, to the west, past the Engineering Lab, you'll find the Dredgion Control Center.</p>

          <p>Well, we know that Tiamat is in the Dragon Lord's Refuge, which is... up there... somewhere. But we have no idea how to get there. Yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There must be a way up from the Tiamat Stronghold. We'll just have to keep looking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and if you head to the Military Ward, do take care. There's a prison camp there, and the inmates are out for blood. They don't care whose.</p>
