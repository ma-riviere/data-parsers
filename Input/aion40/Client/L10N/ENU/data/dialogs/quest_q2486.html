          <p>That means the creatures that the Lepharist Revolutionaries have in Elysea are now in Asmodae as well. I think we'd best look further into this.</p>

          <p>First, meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kushar] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC1_12]. Kushar may be an expert in the Lepharists, but he's never seen a Pretor. His study is based on documents and second-hand accounts.</p>

          <p>Meet anyone he introduces you to, gather information and meet Mirka again to formulate a plan.</p>
