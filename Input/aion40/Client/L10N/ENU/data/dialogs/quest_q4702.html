          <p>This is a very important mission. If you succeed, we will hold the dominant position against the Balaur. You know how badly we need that.</p>

          <p>Balaur train Draconute soldiers in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_All]. It's where they get accustomed to battle in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>We've only recently located it, and in fact it was a Shugo called Kaoranerk who discovered the rift in the first place, and the traning camp that it led to.</p>

          <p>Inside the Nochsana Training Camp, you'll find an Artifact called the Shield of Compassion and the Fortress Gate. The gate leads to the Nochsana Training Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This task will be much easier for you if you activate the Artifact. This siege weapon should help quite a lot with destroying the Nochsana Training Fortress Gate.</p>
