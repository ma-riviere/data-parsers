          <p>Asmodians or the Balaur? The Balaur or Asmodians?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We would never have a chance to fight one or the other, but if I were given the choice, I'd take Asmodians every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it. Even if we're so utterly different now, we were still born from the same seed. We both use Aether, both have our Lords, both share a common ancestry.</p>

          <p>Not now, but our origins are one and the same. The Balaur, on the other hand, are entirely alien.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up_Rhoo_SZ_All] for example. Even after our most determined attacks, they still control it and why? Why are they even there?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We hear whispers of great treasures but when we scout the area, there's nothing but a wall of sharpened Balaur spears in our path. We need a Daeva of unrivalled power to enter the ruins and see what they can find. Will you do it?</p>

          <p>Now the most important thing is that the Balaur contingent there is entirely destroyed. Leave nothing standing. If you're able to take some...mementoes of your time there, then help yourself. Just don't let it get in the way of your primary task.</p>
