          <p>Good, I've been looking for a healthy Daeva to help me. I'm up to my eyeballs in sick people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Villagers are suffering from severe stomachache and fever. It may have been something they ate or drank.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid the brook in front of the village is contaminated. We get our water from there since the well dried up. I need to conduct some tests.</p>

          <p>To find the source of the contamination, I need a sample of the water. But I don't have time with all these people needing me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, could you take this bottle and go to the brook in front of the village to collect some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF2_Polluted_Water].</p>

          <p>Recently I've seen flies in the brook. That's worth investigating. Try and collect the water from around there.</p>

          <p>Good. That should slow them down for a while. If only we could drive them out completely from the area...but it's practically impossible for us to do it with so few people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime, we'll manage the village's water source more carefully. Without that water, we're all dead.</p>

          <p>Asclepius, who was posted at Agairon Village, said that there was contamination in the village's water source. He told you to ask Jumentis, a poison expert in Sanctum, to analyze the contaminated water. After analyzing the sample, Jumentis said Meslamtaeda's Blood was the cause of the contamination and he would send the antidote to the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned to the village with your report, Asclepius knew that Lepharist Revolutionaries had spread the poison. So, you punished the Lepharists.</p>
