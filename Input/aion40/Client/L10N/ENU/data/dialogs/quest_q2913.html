          <p>I loaned him some money. He looked absolutely desperate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been days, and I've not heard anything from him. He'd better not have drunk it up in the Apellbine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not as if I've got Kinah to burn. If I write a letter to Fjuedil, will you deliver it for me? I'd do it myself, but I'm still exhausted.</p>

          <p>Agamo--I knew it! It's been on my mind constantly. But...what can I do? It's Kamorunerk of the Kuairirk Traders--he didn't pay for his latest shipment.</p>

          <p>Since Agamo sent you, perhaps you should go and find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_10] yourself. I can't desert my post. I'm sure you can convince him to pay off his debt.</p>

          <p>You went to the Apellbine to meet Jeckrow, and he promised to borrow the money he owed from somewhere so that he could pay off his debt.</p>
