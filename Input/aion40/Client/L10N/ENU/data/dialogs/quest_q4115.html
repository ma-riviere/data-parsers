          <p>Ah, [%username]. Have you seen the Distorted Dimensional Rift that suddenly formed at Baltasar Hill Village?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brusthonin is famous its lack of rifts, and now this huge thing shows up?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've asked [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Surt] to investigate the rift, but he hasn't reported back yet. I'd like you to find him and offer your assistance.</p>

        	<p>Can't you see I'm busy? Oh, Hort sent you? I was going to request some additional Daevas from him, but you'll do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assigned a research scientist to investigate the rift. He's not much in combat, but quite intelligent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to his report, the rift is a path leading to the Theobomos Lab.</p>

        	<p>I have enough problems dealing with the Undead already. I don't need a rift leading to a lab in Elysea on top of it all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to report this to Pandaemonium. In the meantime, can you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_parqusha] in front of the Distorted Dimensional Rift?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a wise researcher, just do what he tells you.</p>

          <p>Finally, someone to help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told Surt how serious the situation was, but no one else ever showed up. I'm a research scientist, not a warrior.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we can get some real work done.</p>

          <p>Beyond the Distorted Dimensional Rift is Theobomos Lab, in Elysea! I've been there! To a place that I've only read about in dusty books in research libraries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>of course, now that I know where it leads, I need to take action. That's where you come in.</p>

          <p>Hort was worried about a rift that opened up in Brusthonin. He sent you to Surt, who asked you to go see the researcher Parqusha, who had sent a report saying the rift was connected to the Theobomos Lab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Parqusha asked you for help, saying he has to take action, now that he knows where rift leads.</p>
