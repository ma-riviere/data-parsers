          <p>Never enough time in the day, you know. Patrols, investigations, guard duty. I could have two more of me on hand, and...ACHOO!...and still there would be work piling up every day.</p>

          <p>No, he doesn't! The residents got so fed up with his staggering inaction, they just ignore him these days. There's only one thing he cares about, and that's his novel concept of nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would sooner be alone. At least then the Centurions would understand why I'm constantly backlogged and unable to get my work done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've just got these complaints in--seems the Manduri are up to their old tricks, stealing from the travellers and residents of the fortress. And can I do anything about it? No I cannot. Not a thing.</p>

          <p>Whatever they can get their hands on! Most of the time it's just useless junk, or actual waste, but occasionally they'll steal something of value.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This time, we've lost a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1307a] and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1307b]. The residents have enough on their plate without having to worry about the wildlife attacking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone to go and get those things back for me while I sort through the other reports. Do you think you might have the time to help out?</p>

          <p>Oh thank goodness for that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, the Manduri are based in two main areas--the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_A1_SUB_1] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_A1_SUB_2]. Of all the Manduri creatures, I have only seen the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriT_21_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriB_21_An]s actually engage in thievery, so you should concentrate on them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll tell you now, the day those Manduri stop stealing from us is the day I get my first solid night's sleep. Good luck, [%username]!</p>
