          <p>When did the Elyos come to Brusthonin? How many of them are there? If we attack without more information, we'll be asking for a beating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If nothing else, the labor team probably tipped off the Elyos that we're somewhere nearby, so we can't hesitate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before we do anything, we should scout the Elyos outpost.</p>

          <p>You infiltrated the Elyos encampment and discovered the dead without being detected. I'm not sure any of my people could have done that.</p>

          <p>I was hoping you'd say that.</p>

          <p>We need to lower their morale, find out how strong they are and what weapons they're using--and lastly, we need to retaliate for the slain laborers.</p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>Given that the team was killed with such sharp weapons, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LightDevaAsD_24_An]s or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LightDevaFiD_24_An]s should be your primary targets.</p>
