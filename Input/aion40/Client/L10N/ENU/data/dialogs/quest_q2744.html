          <p>[%username], did you see a Soul on your way here? It looks like a floating mass of rock carrying a load of minerals on its back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd never seen or heard of such a thing, but Priest Ganglot says he feels the energy of souls within it. But Ganglot has become a little odd of late, so he could be feeling hungry or thirsty for all I know. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He thinks that the souls of Daevas who vanished in Reshanta might have been absorbed by a mineral that eventually transformed into that hideous creature.</p>

          <p>I don't know if he is right or not--I know nothing about minerals or souls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Ganglot is quite serious and insists that we gather fragments of Souls and send them to Pandaemonium for research. He wants them examined by a Protector of Divinity with better skills than his own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you please help me gather fragments of Soul, [%username]? I cannot leave the priest alone. Elyos may appear at any time.</p>

          <p>All right, good. Now, Ganglot says there are two types of Souls: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1132_SouledStone_25_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1132_SouledStoneB_25_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to gather fragments of both for better analysis.</p>

          <p>A mass of moving rock imbued with souls. Nonsense, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can be frank with me. I thought he was crazy when I first heard about it too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, after working with Ganglot these weeks and seeing and hearing at least three incredible things every morning before breakfast, I now believe. If you can't, I understand.</p>

          <p>It's not exactly an urgent mission. Even if you gather them now, I cannot send them immediately to Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>Look at these fragments. They glow with a dim, blue light. Aren't they beautiful?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even I feel a mysterious energy. I may have heard too much talk of soul imbuing and the like. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I have no idea what they are. I just need to pack them safely off to Pandaemonium. Thank you for your help.</p>
