          <p>When we foiled their [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA19]-mining plot, the Tursin Krall doubled their defenses. So we know they have Odium, but not how much, or if they can refine it.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_MLA128] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF1A_TKrallShamanNmd_19_An] are the most powerful Head Priests. Take out one of them and it'll destabilize the Krall power structur considerably.</p>
