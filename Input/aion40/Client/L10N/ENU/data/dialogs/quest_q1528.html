          <p>This leather looks strange. It doesn't look like Clodworm Leather at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The color's wrong. Normally there's a red luster, but this one's bluish.</p>

          <p>If you insist. I believe you. Still, this is strange. It isn't just the color. Even the texture is wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Clodworm Leather is smooth and soft, but this is hard and rough. Though, it does have the circular pattern of Clodworms....</p>

          <p>I'm confused.</p>

          <p>I hear Agrints have appeared in the Decayed Grove. Maybe they've affected the Clodworms in the Black Tears Swamp.</p>
