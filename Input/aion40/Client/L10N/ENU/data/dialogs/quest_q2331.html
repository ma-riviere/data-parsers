          <p>I'm always sad when I have to kill a Kentari. They were once Asmodians, you know, cursed by the Empyrean Lords for helping some Elyos a long time ago.</p>

          <p>Perhaps that was part of the curse. I know I was ordered to do it, but I cannot kill him in good conscience.</p>

          <p>But since you don't seem to take this seriously, perhaps you could do it instead?</p>
