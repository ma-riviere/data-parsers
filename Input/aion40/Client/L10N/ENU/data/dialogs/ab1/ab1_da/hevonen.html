          <p>Have you heard any news from the Sulfur Archipelago? There's been so much teleport traffic, but everyone who comes through rushes off without a word.</p>

          <p>We haven't had any news from the Wings of Siel Archipelago either.</p>

          <p>My son is posted to the Sulfur Archipelago. My husband just left for the Wings of Siel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know they're serving Azphel with honor. I'm proud of them both. Someone's got to keep those sun-blighted Elyos in check.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's hard to be separated from family in times like these.</p>
