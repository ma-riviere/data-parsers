          <p>Do you think the Elyos-Asmodian War will ever end? I've come to doubt it. At least I don't expect to see it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the past, I avoided fighting. It seemed a pity for Daevas to kill each other endlessly.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>But things change. To end this war, a lot more people have to die, many more. So we'd better get to it!</p>
