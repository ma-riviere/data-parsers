          <p>I heard an interesting story from a Priest recently. Ereshkigal, one of the five Balaur lords, is known as an administrator of commandments and punishments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ereshkigal punishes whoever violates the commandments. He shows no mercy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I don't know about you, but when I think Balaur, I think disorder, intemperance, destruction, and chaos.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>That story seems to suggest something different, does it not?</p>
