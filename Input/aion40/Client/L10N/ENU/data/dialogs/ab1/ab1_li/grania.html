          <p>You know, whenever I'm going into combat I can't help looking around to see which are the raw recruits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's wrong, but I don't like fighting anywhere near them. Beginners make mistakes, and veterans pay the price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look--those Daevas who are agitated and blushing with excitement--those are the ones you have to watch out for. I just hope they can keep a cool head in combat.</p>
