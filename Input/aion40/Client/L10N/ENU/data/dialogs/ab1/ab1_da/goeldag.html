          <p>We are very fortunate to be serving under Centurion Aslak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many capable people in the Red Hasia Legion, but someone like Centurion Aslak is rare. He possesses great scouting ability as well as a keen sense of judgment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I learn a lot from serving with him. Perhaps I'll be as good as the Centurion some day if I pay attention and learn all I can from him.</p>
