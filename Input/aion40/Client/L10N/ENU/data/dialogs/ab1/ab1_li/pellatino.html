          <p>What did you say? I'm sorry, I'm a little distracted, thinking about my family back home. It's been so long since I was able to see them, or even send them a message....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a daughter, you know. I ascended shortly after I got married, and my wife was already pregnant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone says I should leave her, that it will be too painful as she grows old and I do not. Bah! In my position, chances are that she'll survive longer than I will. We may as well enjoy the time we've got.</p>
