          <p>This is my first combat assignment. I'm not really sure why they sent me here without much combat experience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first, I thought it was nice. They must think I'm good, right? I figured I could get promoted quickly, earn some commendations, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...now I find myself dreading battle. I can't sleep. Training is one thing, but this...real war...it's different. I never knew it would be so stressful.</p>
