          <p>These new recruits don't know what hardship is! They lack training and discipline.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the early days, when I shouted "JUMP," recruits spread their wings and shouted "how high?" But nowadays..? I'm lucky if I even get a response. They're as insolent and lazy as those effete Elyos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'll set those sluggardly Daevas right. Just let me send them on a few missions into enemy territory, that'll learn them! Blood for blood!</p>
