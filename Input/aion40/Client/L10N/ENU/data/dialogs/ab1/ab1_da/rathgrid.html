          <p>It's very gratifying to me that so many of our Legionaries are ambitious and full of vigor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's because we have many young Daevas in our ranks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seeing soldiers so full of passion and ambition is like seeing myself in my youth. Sometimes they do go over the line, but that's a small price to pay for excellence in combat.</p>
