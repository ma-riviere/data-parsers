          <p>This supply shortage is killing me. Every fortress is clamoring for more, but we just don't have anything to send them.</p>

          <p>The Asmodians knew exactly where to find our convoy and took everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need better security along our supply lines. I keep telling them, but nobody listens to me.</p>

          <p>Not really. We've got all the hands we need around here. It's supplies that are lacking.</p>

          <p>And Dellaron...well, the kid tends to goof off. He tells great stories, but I spend a lot of time covering for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't encourage him, okay? Even with the supply shortage, we've got too much to do around here.</p>
