          <p>No matter how hard we dig in, the Elyos and Balaur are always trying to take this fortress from us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I figure the best defense is a good offense. Assault their fortresses, and they'll be too busy to attack us here.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, maybe that's why they're assaulting us, eh?</p>
