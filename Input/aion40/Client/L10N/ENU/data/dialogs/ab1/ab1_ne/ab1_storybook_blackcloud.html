          <p> </p>
          <p>Those new Traders members who just advanced to the Abyss should be happy but also cautious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This isn't a place where easy gold is to be had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Javirunerk is a senior member who advanced to the Abyss earlier than you, and will give you some useful advice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These will be of help for you to become an excellent Traders member.</p>

          <p> 1. Be always confidential. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most important principle for Black Cloud Traders is confidentiality. You may have already heard it many times, but you can never emphasize it too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strict confidentiality is our weapon in a situation where we don't have as much capital and intelligence as other existing Shugo Traders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You always need to move secretively, and you should not allow information like the lists of business connections and customers to be exposed to anyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't forget that your thoughtless words can expose the life of you and your colleagues to danger. Other traders, bandits, and other dangers will come for careless Traders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The discord with Tigraki Workshop in the past was a misfortune resulting from information leakage. Fortunately, now, the relationship has been recovered. Please keep in mind, however, that it can happen again.</p>

          <p> 2. There are things more important than Kinah. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a rule you must never forget. Dead Traders earn no Kinah. The most precious things for Traders are your life and colleagues.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though Shugos are known to put Kinah above all, Black Cloud Traders are different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In Abyss, Kinah can seldom be of help when you are in danger. Rather than Kinah, your own ability and your colleagues will be the most help in a crisis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't be swayed by Kinah in front of you. Never forget that helping your colleagues and keeping the rule will bring you much more Kinah in the future.</p>

          <p> 3. Stretch out the horizon of your thought. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The success of Black Cloud Traders is because we did what other Shugos have never thought of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be promoted to a high position in Traders, you need more than your trading technique or skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just like the first Traders Captain who thought of bringing those alienated Shugos to the Abyss and doing business there, only a Shugo who has novel ideas and the courage to realize them can be a real member of the Traders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Throw away your old thoughts. Be prepared to accept new ideas. Do not reject those different from traditional ideas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you don't like to change your way of thinking and prefer things to not change, you'd better leave the Traders.</p>

          <p> 4. Maintain the sense of balance. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the important virtues for a Traders member is the sense of balance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must be flexible in order to deal with Elyos, Asmodians, and Sapiens as well as the Shugos of other Traders. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Depending on the situation, you have to practice the art of living to get favor from Draconutes or Nagas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not forget that Asmodian and Elyos are all our precious customers, even if they are hateful enemies to each other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So be cautious not to offend their feelings. A trifle mistake may invite a situation in which our customer regards the whole Traders as his or her enemy.</p>

          <p> 5. Make an effort to develop yourself. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fact that you were selected as a member of the proud Black Cloud Traders means that you have sufficient ability and potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, you must not be satisfied with a small achievement in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you don't want to become a Shugo like Fat Porgus, continue to invest time in developing yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make an effort to learn the languages of Elyos, Asmodians, and Sapiens. In addition, it is quite useful to build up a close relationship with excellent Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you obtain important information, you must remember it even though it isn't for immediate use, and do not hesitate to learn a skill if you have a chance to learn it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In these ways you and all the Traders will prosper.</p>
