          <p>I'm a soldier, not a philosopher. But sitting out here on this rock, I can't help but wonder about how one unified Atreia divided into two warring sides? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course I know it's because of the Cataclysm. But, why didn't Aion prevent the destruction of Atreia? And is demolishing the remaining Aion Tower in Elysea really the only way for our survival?</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pardon me, I'm blathering on to someone I hardly know. Pay no attention to me.</p>
