          <p>What do you want? I'm preparing the Gray Wind Legionaries for an attack and I have no spare time for idle gossip.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to join the unit you'll have to wait until we return. If you've any other issue you should talk to Metis, my Adjutant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's right over there. I know she looks small, but she's as well-trained as anyone in my command. In the Gray Wind Legionaries, everyone fights.</p>
