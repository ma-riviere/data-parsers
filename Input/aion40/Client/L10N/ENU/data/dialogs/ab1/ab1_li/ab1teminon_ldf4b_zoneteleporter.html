          <p>Are you off to some big battle in Tiamaranta? I've been sending Daevas there all day long. Looks like they're gearing up for something huge.</p>

          <p>Did you come up a few Kinah short? It happens from time to time. Or maybe you haven't received clearance to go to Tiamaranta. If you saw it, you'd know why they don't let just anybody go there.</p>
