          <p>Young Daeva, will you listen to what I have to say?</p>

          <p>I see...phantasms, I see numerous phantasms around you.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>This charm.... It transfers your experience to those in your care.</p>

          <p>Your bond to them will become stronger, and preserve you from future harm.</p>

          <p>Well, that's a weight off my mind! You should have her read your fortune as well, Daeva.</p>
