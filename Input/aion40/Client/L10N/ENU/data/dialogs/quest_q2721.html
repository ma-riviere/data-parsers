          <p>Attend me [%username], I have high expectations for a Daeva like yourself. Let's get right to work, shall we?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I expect superior military achievements from you here in Reshanta. To start you on your way, I want you to meet Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garvages] who leads the Thunder Shout Legion and Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Herz] who heads up the Red Hasia Legion.</p>

          <p>Good, let's waste no time then. The gladiators and templars of the Thunder Shout Legion are our front line troops in Reshanta. They are battle hardened and forged by blood into a brutal force against the enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Hasia Legion is in charge of scouting. Their assassins and spies are often called to draw upon their, ahem, unique talents to remove individuals from the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go meet these two brigade generals and seek counsel from them. You'll need all the help you can get if you want to survive in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>There is no time to waste Daeva, we need to bring you up to combat readiness on the double! First, go meet Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garvages].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He knows much about fighting in the Abyss. His knowledge might just help you keep your head, and wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, go to talk with Brigade General Hisui and Quartermaster Spyr.</p>

          <p>No?! You must meet the brigade generals. I will not accept your refusal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With that kind of attitude you're going to die and probably take some good troops with you. Readiness now means you get to keep your head and wings on your shoulders later.</p>

          <p>Ah, so you're the Daeva I've heard about. You've become quite notorious, err, famous for your prowess. You'll find out soon enough that fighting in the Abyss is no ribbit hunting trip.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, the Red Hasia Legion has vast territories to scout, and we can always use a few volunteers to assist in our information gathering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now, go to see Quartermaster [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Spyr]. That tight-fisted Daeva has something from the governor for you. Make sure that you get it.</p>
