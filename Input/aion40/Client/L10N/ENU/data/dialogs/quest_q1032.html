          <p>My role in this world is to ensure the forests of Elysea are kept safe from harm. Unfortunately, our presence here has done little to prevent Eltnen's shocking desertification.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look around, [%username]. This arid desert was once a green paradise; now there are only a few trees left, surrounded by an ocean of dust and sand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all so overwhelming....</p>

          <p>No, no. The Elim are also hard at work, but the challenge is simply too great.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this were a natural change, we could have adapted. But there is something else at work here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eltnen's Aether is slowly being drained, you see. Even poor Lodas, ruler of Eltnen's forests, has been left withered and gnarled by the loss.</p>

          <p>The Manduri forest, for example. I know of at least two Elim who now live there, though it seems they are still not at peace. They have been calling for help, in fact.</p>
