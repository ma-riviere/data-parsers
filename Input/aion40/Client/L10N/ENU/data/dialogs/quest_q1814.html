          <p>Care for a tough mission, Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Eye of Reshanta is guarded by three strongholds, The Kysis Fortress, Krotan Refuge, and Miren Fortress. We're here to take Kysis from the Asmodians and keep it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vergilius and I have a plan to make sure that happens.</p>

          <p>We're assembling a host to storm the fortress. The Asmodians seem to have noticed our movements and have moved elite troops here. That's both a problem and an opportunity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Volunteers like you, [%username], are slipping behind their lines and disrupting their troops. Someone of your caliber could handle these elites, and that would really hurt Asmodian morale. Interested?</p>

          <p>Very brave. Okay, here are your orders. Enter the Kysis Fortress as soon as it switches to the vulnerable state. Find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1814_all] in the fortress, kill those you can and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1814a]s.</p>
