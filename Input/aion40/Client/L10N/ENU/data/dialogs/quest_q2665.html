          <p>Thanks to a certain talkative mid-rank staff officer I've learned some top secret information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll report it right away. But it may be too late to take action if I wait for orders... But, I can't take action by myself. I don't know what to do!</p>

          <p>There is something that looks like a gate in Alquimia Approach and another at Alquimia Stronghold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was curious why they set up two gate-looking objects--neither of them were entrances to a building or a monument. Moreover, elite soldiers always guard the place. My intuition told me something was up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I heard the gates connect to the Abyss!</p>

          <p>Yes! The gate in Alquimia Approach is the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_LehparGate_Q2620A] and the one in Alquimia Stronghold is the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_LehparGate_Q2620B].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means the Lepharists are expanding their influence to the Abyss. Can you imagine the trouble they could cause? What if they teamed up with the Ellies or worse...the Balaur?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to destroy those gates immediately. I believe you, [%username], are perfect for the job. Will you take on this mission?</p>
