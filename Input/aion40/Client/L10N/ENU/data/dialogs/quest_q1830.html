		<p>I don't know how I ended up working in the Tigraki Workshop when I can't stand the smell of Balaur!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>The food we make with it is very filling, and keeps well on the battlefield, but that doesn't make it smell better.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Anyway, I'll give you a design if you bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart]s or [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart_Hot]s, though I'll be even happier if you bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart_fire]s.</p>
