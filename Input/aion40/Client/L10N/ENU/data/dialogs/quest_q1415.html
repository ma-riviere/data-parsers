          <p>It's time we launched a raid against the Kaidan Headquarters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In light of recent developments, it's clear that we have a golden opportunity. Krall are inherently lazy and cowardly. If we take this chance to hurt them, they'll be reluctant to approach our forces for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, now we have someone we can rely on.</p>

          <p>You're correct. Just by taking out a few of their better fighters, we can throw the Kaidan Krall into disarray.</p>
          <p> </p>  
          <p>Go to the Kaidan Headquarters and kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_all_KrallWarrior]s. Collect their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1415a]s and we'll put them on the trophy wall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Crack Kaidan Warmonger, Crack Kaidan Slashers, Kaidan Juggernaut, Crack Kaidan Smashers and Crack Kaidan Skullcrackers are the major combat forces, but I think they've met their match in you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Excellent. Get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_all_KrallWarrior]s in the Kaidan Headquarters. They are the motivating force of the Kaidan Krall.</p>
