          <p>Rich folks back in Pandaemonium collect Sapien stuff--MuMu hairpins, Mau claws, that kind of thing. What I'm after is something special.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stories say the MuMu chieftain gives a ring to each of his wives. In the stories, there are three different kinds: [%dic:STR_DIC_I_RING_D_N_C_16C], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_RING_D_N_C_16D], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_RING_D_N_C_16E]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I get all three, you see what they'd be worth? MuMu rings straight from the storybooks! They'll pay a fortune!</p>
