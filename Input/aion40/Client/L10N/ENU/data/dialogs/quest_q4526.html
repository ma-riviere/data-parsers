          <p>Despite the language barrier between ourselves and the Elyos, we actually know quite a bit about what happens in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is partly thanks to espionage missions undertaken by our own Daevas. We manage to piece together a surprising amount from bits of intel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't ask me how I know these things; I have my sources. One of them told me about an Elyos legionary named Icaronix. He's a bad one.</p>

          <p>Actually, yes. He's a Lepharist who apparently betrayed his superior, one of the top Elyos commanders. This commander vanished, and no one knows what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it were just that, he could be safely ignored. But it seems he has some leadership qualities that are helping the Lepharists in general. That includes here in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This cannot stand, of course. You would do us all a favor by eliminating Icaronix once and for all.</p>

          <p>I hope you know what you're doing, [%username]. Infiltrating [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_Lehpar] won't be easy, for many obvious reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But any blow we can strike to the Lepharists anywhere will help us deal with them here. It's bad enough fighting the Elyos and Balaur; we don't need another front.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though if you happen to meet any Elyos along the way... Well, let's just say you should do what any good Asmodian soldier would do.</p>

          <p>I know it seems like you'd be doing the Elyos a favor, and I know that repulses you. But you'd actually be helping Asmodae too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lepharists are a blight in both our worlds. If they succeed in Elysea, they can turn their combined resources on us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd be caught between them and the Balaur.... It's not a pretty thought. Do I alter your mind at all?</p>

          <p>It's hard to understand what the Lepharists want, exactly. Surely they know that if the Balaur triumph, we all lose, including them?</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Imagine what it would've been like had all Lepharists been so altered. Even our Daevas would've had a difficult time with it.</p>
