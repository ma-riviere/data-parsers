          <p>I know that manastones are fairly common, but our researchers don't have time to go hunting for them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most manastones are sold at a bargain to stores, and that's really a shame--so much potential research gone to waste.</p>

          <p>You know, maybe you can help us out. We need some manastones--HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 specifically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have all three and are willing to part with them, I can exchange them for a much better one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll be more beneficial to you than selling them to a store for next to nothing.</p>
