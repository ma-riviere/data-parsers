          <p>I don't know what's happened to this village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First the water shortage, then Nomiki's Qooqoos got loose, now there's a Tipolid infestation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reclaiming the Mystic Spring would solve most of our problems, but we just don't have enough soldiers available for that.</p>

          <p>The villagers are totally on edge. You can't say five words without someone biting your head off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've been complaining that the Tipolids are keeping them up all night. Which is probably true; everyone is certainly behaving like they're sleep deprived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a village of grumps.</p>

          <p>Really? That would be fantastic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you possibly thin the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_hippolizardCh_33_An] population a bit? I hunted them all day yesterday, but there are still so many.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can decrease their population, perhaps the villagers could get some sleep and attitudes will improve.</p>

          <p>To be honest, it's a bit embarrassing asking for help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what can I do? It's my duty to take care of the villagers. Even if that means singing them to sleep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'd hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_hippolizardCh_33_An]s near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G3], that would be a great help.</p>

          <p>I don't blame you. "Hunt Tipolids for us, we can't sleep, they're too noisy!" What kind of a request is that for a Guardian?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can't help, I'll just have to tell them to suck it up.</p>

          <p>At this rate, I might celebrate if they abandon the village!</p>

          <p>No, not really. But it's exhausting listening to them. Anyway, did you clear out some of the Tipolids?</p>

          <p>Thank Ariel! Now, maybe the villagers will get some sleep and stop being so blasted crabby!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then perhaps we can get some things done around here.</p>
