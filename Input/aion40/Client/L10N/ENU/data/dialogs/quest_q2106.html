          <p>I still have a few reports to get through, but I'm done with the urgent ones. They need to be delivered to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tobu], second in command of the Ulgorn Raiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These reports are highly important, [%username]. Tobu and Ulgorn need to know that we're making progress on our quotas--that we're doing our job as raiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>More to the point: Without these reports, none of us get paid come caravan-time.</p>

          <p>Usually I deliver them myself, [%userclass]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm so very busy.... Look, just take these up to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tobu], will you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm including some of the fruits you collected as a gift for Tobu, so make sure you don't bruise them. These reports are a little late, so I'm hoping he'll consider the fruit my way of saying sorry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you deliver the reports?</p>

          <p>Good. You should find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tobu] in the center of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_2]. He hardly ever leaves Ulgorn's side. So if you see the boss, you'll probably see Tobu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and one last thing: Be sure to mention that I prepared the fruit. I'm tired of being on Tobu's bad side.</p>

          <p>Oh, is a simple task beneath you?</p>

          <p>Be careful who you cross, [%username]. I'm first in line to take over for Tobu when he decides to retire from raiding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And once I'm second in command of the raiders, it'll be Vanar doling out the various jobs we all have to do.</p>

          <p>Think of the worst possible duty, then imagine doing that every single day. Care to reconsider?</p>

          <p>All right, I'll save you the walk. I was saving this teleport scroll, but I did get it from that wandering fortuneteller. Maybe it's best if I use it up on you, anyway.</p>

          <p>Hah! He thinks he can charm me with a fruit basket? I'm an Ulgorn Raider! I have no desire for such softness as fruit baskets!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen closely, [%userclass]. You'd do well to distance yourself from that fool. Vanar can talk, but he's a coward and gets no respect from the others. If you want to make it as a raider, you need to display loyalty, grit, and ability. There's a good reason we stuck Vanar way out in the Aldelle Basin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thanks for the reports. I'll pass on whatever Ulgorn needs to see.</p>
