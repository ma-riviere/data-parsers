          <p>If what I've just heard is true, [%username], the Steel Rake Pirates are using Stigma!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It beggars belief, but I heard it from a credible source. And if it's true, we can scarcely afford to ignore it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I don't have to tell you how difficult it is to learn to harness that kind of power. And yet these hairy little pirates....</p>

          <p>What's really frightening is this--if the Shulack pirates know how to use the power of Stigma, how long will it be before the Balaur can do so also?</p>
