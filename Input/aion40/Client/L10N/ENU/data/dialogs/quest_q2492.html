          <p>I just have one question: How did you know that I had lost the pendant?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only one person knew I had lost the divine pendant. I asked Signi to find it, but I made it clear not to mention it to anyone else. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Signi didn't say anything, someone else must've told you....</p>

          <p>As the Protector of Divinity, I am responsible for the well-being of all. I'd like to take care of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sveinn] from now on. Would you help me?</p>
