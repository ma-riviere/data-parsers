          <p>[%username], you are a most superior Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have an even more difficult mission now, one that I would like you to lead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could not in good conscience give this mission to either Sakmis or Calon, but I am sure you will succeed.</p>

          <p>We must defeat the Guardian Generals of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q1737all]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to occupy the fortresses, we must drive out the enemy completely. By defeating their Guardian Generals, we will surely break their morale.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gather a Force. Lead them to defeat a Guardian General once the fortress battle begins, and report back to me. I will be glad to hear your account of this epic battle.</p>
