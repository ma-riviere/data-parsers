          <p>[%username], as a Daeva, you're aware of the disorientation and pain that come from using an Obelisk. </p>

          <p>Resurrection causes serious physical and mental aftereffects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Soul Healers, we help resurrected Daevas recover from these.</p>

          <p>This may be a delicate subject, but as far as I know, the Lepharist Revolutionaries have surprisingly few Soul Healers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked around about this, and even sent a letter to a researcher who studies them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to him, the Laboratory of WonshiKutz in the Lepharist Citadel makes a special ointment that helps Daevas recover from resurrection after effects.</p>

          <p>His story fires my curiosity. What kind of ointment could equal the attentions of a Soul Healer? Apparently it smells terrible!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lepharist Citadel isn't far from here, but a Human like me could never go there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], will you go to the Laboratory of WonshiKutz and find some of the Smelly Ointment the Lepharists use? </p>

          <p>My source says The Laboratory of WonshiKutz is under the building located at the entrance of the Lepharist Citadel.</p>

          <p>[%username], even you must have resurrected at least once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine how that felt, but as a Soul Healer, I've helped many Daevas recover afterward. I know it's not easy.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>The researcher was right about one thing, at least--it smells terrible!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll analyze the components--perhaps we can isolate the active ingredient and make an ointment that doesn't stink from here to Elysea.</p>
