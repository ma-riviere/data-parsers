          <p>I was just about to contact you. I have a favor to ask.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you can tell, Krotan Rock is very hot. In fact, this area is known as the Sea of Lava. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The heat is causing a problem. </p>

          <p>Well, it drains the energy out of our soldiers, but more importantly, bends weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you know, [%username], weapons can be very sensitive to heat. Any slight deformation can cause big problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a solution, but neither my soldiers nor I can leave our posts now to make it happen. Can you help?</p>

          <p>All right! We caught this Asmodian scout sneaking around the fortress, and his sword was intact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We interrogated him and found out that the sword was made by mixing [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1822a] into the metal. Apparently it's highly resistant to fire and doesn't melt--even in the lava.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, if you could defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_Pretor_38_An]s around here and bring me their hearts, I'd be grateful.</p>

          <p>Amazing. I thought they'd be hot, but they're as cold as ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know that it's best to melt them into the weapons as you make them, but I just don't have the time. I'm going to try melting them and coating the weapons--ought to be better than nothing.</p>

          <p>At his request, you defeated the Ravenous Pretors and took their hearts to him. Moirai said he would melt the hearts and coat the weapons as a temporary solution.</p>
