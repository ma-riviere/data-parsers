          <p>This is special kind of armor, nyerk. It is very strong, yet very light and easy to wear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like all Mist equipment, it turns back into mist after a certain time, so we sell very cheaply. You will not get better deal for such strong items anywhere!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not offer such a low price to everyone, so you had better buy!</p>
