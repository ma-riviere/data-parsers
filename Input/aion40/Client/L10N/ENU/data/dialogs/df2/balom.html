          <p>Alsig Village isn't a healthy place for Humans to live. But there's no place better to raise Tripeeds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tripeeds grown in other places aren't nearly as good a quality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The choosiest assassins and rangers prefer the Tripeeds of our village.</p>

          <p>There are people who made their fortunes here and then left for an easy life in Pandaemonium or the Fortress. But not everyone gets rich. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I don't want to leave this village. Raising Tripeeds is my passion. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, there have been some problems lately... but I'm sure it will all get sorted out soon.</p>
