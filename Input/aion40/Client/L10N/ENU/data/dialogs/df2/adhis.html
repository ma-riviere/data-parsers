          <p>Centurion Mirka has great strength of character. I have never seen him get angry or raise his voice. And yet people follow him! Isn't that admirable? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope to garner such loyalty from my followers when I become a Centurion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I try to control my temper, but it's not easy. </p>
