          <p>The two-hundred and forty-ninth year after the Cataclysm was a time of strange signs. Tremors in the earth and lights in the sky were reported from all corners of Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Marchutan, fearing they might be omens of something terrible, sequestered himself away to study these portents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the streets of Pandaemonium, in the villages and farms, one rumor was on everyone's thoughts: the Balaur were returning.</p>

          <p>When Lord Marchutan emerged from his tower, his always-stoic face showed the faintest signs of concern. The portents were clear, he said. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A doorway would be opening in the desert of Morheim, a doorway to another place. Something would be coming through.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Azphel ordered Lord Zikel to lead a force to Morheim immediately, to force the invaders back from Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was in the Steel Dagger Legion then, and it was my honor to be called upon by Lord Zikel, to serve directly under a Shedim Lord.</p>

          <p>As our new Legion--the Shadow's Guard Legion, made of the finest fighting men in Asmodae--set out for Morheim, strange omens continued across the land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All of the shattered pieces of the Tower of Eternity, broken by the Cataclysm and strewn to all corners of the world, began to slowly rise into the sky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something dire would happen soon. We all felt it.</p>

          <p>When we reached the deserts of Morheim, the air itself crackled with Aetheric lightning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Following Marchutan's prophecies, we set our camp in the heart of the desert, and waited. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Zikel neither slept nor ate, simply stood and stared off into the sky, as if he saw something none of us could.</p>

          <p>Zikel's shout woke us in the blue hour of dawn. Fear wiped the sleep from our eyes when we saw the portal opening, glowing rays streaming out from a hole in the sky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It made terrible ripping sounds as it grew, until we could make out an army of dark figures in the glare. My hand went to my blade, and I was seized with a cold sweat.</p>

          <p>As the figures stepped out of the portal, we all braced for the worst. But to our shock, Zikel ordered us to stand down--they were not Balaur, but Humans! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet they were quite different from us, their skin warm and tanned, their hair golden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their leader stepped forward to address us, a Daeva of prideful bearing, dressed in elegantly jeweled armor.</p>

          <p>Seeing that we could not understand his speech at first, the Daeva switched to an ancient Human dialect, one that many older Daeva, including myself, still knew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He proclaimed himself as Deltras, leader of the Storm Legion, the pride of Elysea, and the manifest will of Lady Ariel. At the mention of Lady Ariel's name, Zikel bristled.</p>

          <p>Zikel made plain his feelings for Lady Ariel, and all those other traitors that followed Israphel's plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The followers of those deluded Lords, he said, must surely be feeble-minded themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet Deltras continued to boast of the glory of his "Seraphim Lords," casting insults on the Asmodians, calling us abominations that never should have survived the Cataclysm.</p>

          <p>Lord Zikel would hear no more. With one swift gesture, he drew a bolt of Daevic fire from his soul, and pierced the breast of the prideful Deltras.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Storm Legion stood paralyzed in fright at their leaderâ€™s death, and we fell upon them as a crushing wave, showing them the true strength of Aion's chosen people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon seeing our might, they turned tail and ran, fleeing back to Elysea to tell Lady Ariel the news: the Shedim Lords had survived, and they would at last have their revenge on those who brought about the Cataclysm.</p>
