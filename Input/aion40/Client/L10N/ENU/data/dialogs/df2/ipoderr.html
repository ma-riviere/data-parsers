          <p>When we moved to Morheim, I expected the fortress to be a city, but it's more ice than fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't expect high-end boutiques or anything. But there's not even a good restaurant! In Vanahal, we used to order and they delivered the food to our house.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh well, my father says the cold just hardens us, like steel.</p>

          <p>No, my father is a Sentinel at the Temple. He's had lots of different assignments and we've traveled around a lot: Pandaemonium, Vanahal, and now here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this position putting him really close to the Abyss, he expects a promotion soon. I know it will be good for him, but I hope we stop moving around soon.</p>
