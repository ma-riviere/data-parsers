          <p>Believe it or not, we used to be a very small village before the war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we've grown. As long as the war continues in the Abyss and Tripeeds are needed, the village will prosper. But sometimes I worry...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we defeat the Balaur and this war comes to an end, then Tripeeds won't be needed anymore, right? What will happen to the village then? Wars can't go on forever, can they?</p>
