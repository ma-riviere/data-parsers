          <p>I don't look it of course, but I've lived a very long time. Over the years I grew bored with life. Apathy threatened to consume me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But fishing has changed all that. The peace I have found in this pursuit has given new meaning to my life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gathering is about accumulating things. But for a true angler, this isn't about the fish, it's about the fishing. If I ever catch a Gadill here, I will have caught every kind of fish in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No sign yet.... I wonder if I'm using the right kind of bait?</p>
