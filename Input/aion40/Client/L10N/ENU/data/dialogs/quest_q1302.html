          <p>The air around here grows thinner with time, [%username]. Aether thrives where life is abundant, and dissipates where it is sparse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I remember standing atop the fortress when I first came to Eltnen, and seeing nothing but a lush green canopy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So vibrant, so full of life; I could feel the Aether folding around me as I moved. Now the deserts have spread, and the Aether has dissipated.</p>

          <p>Yes. My songs are empowered by Aether: where there is plenty, each has a marked affect. Where there is little, my songs are much less powerful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently there is something else at work though. Many of us have noted the drop in Aether; even the Qooqoos are acting strangely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Phomona, one of the Daevas in the forest, has also been reporting strange happenings.</p>

          <p>The Manduri have been spooked, and have started attacking the trees. The Elim have noticed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, there's no sense in me telling you. Phomona is not far away, and I'm sure she could do with an extra pair of hands.</p>

          <p>Yes, it was the Manduri, but there is no need for panic. The problem has been addressed; tell Clio I feel the Aether calming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You though...you still carry that touch of Aether. I will keep an eye on you, child. I may soon need your aid. When I call on you, you will come.</p>

          <p>Phomona told you that the problem had been caused by the Manduri, and had already been solved. However, she did say that she would bear you in mind if any other problems arose.</p>
