          <p>[%username]! Is that a Guardian Commander's weapon you're carrying? It's amazing, isn't it? But, what if it could be even more amazing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have a Guardian Commander's weapon, some Honorable Mithril Medals, and Abyss Points, you can exchange them for an Honorable Guardian Conqueror's weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have a look. Even if you're happy with your current weapon, you might find something better.</p>
