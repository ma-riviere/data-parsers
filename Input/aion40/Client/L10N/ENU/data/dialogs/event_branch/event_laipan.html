          <p>You there! Were you sent to help us find fossils? Well, I suppose it'll keep you out of trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need insect fossils to start an Atreian Natural History Museum, and we're even offering rewards. Not that we should need to bribe Daevas for such service to Atreia, but I know your type. If you're having trouble tracking them down, just hunt down some monsters and retreive what they've pilfered. Anywhere but Ishalgen and Altgard. You can manage that, surely?</p>

          <p>Scoff, will you? Well, did you know that we can analyze these fossils to find out more about shifts in Atreia's crust? That might help us predict such upheavals in the future. But I know you think you're too good for this kind of work. Well, I suppose I'll take what help I can get.</p>
