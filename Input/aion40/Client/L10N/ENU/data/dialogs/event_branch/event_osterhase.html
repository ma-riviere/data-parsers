          <p>Hello, [%userclass]! Have you ever thought about Darus? I mean, really thought about them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They provide so much for us: fur, meat, horns.... But we take them for granted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I started Daru Days: to force Daevas to take a new look at this much ignored part of our lives!</p>
