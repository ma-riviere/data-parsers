          <p>Oh, Daeva heard about Shugo Springs Pale Ale, this year's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_ITEM_FIRST_BEER]? Word spreading fast! Sales really good, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, only selling beer for tickets, not kinah. Also have Platinum Medals if Daeva prefers. But not easy to get beer, which not only tastes great, but restores the Energy of Repose. So choose carefully, akakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, if Daeva has enough tickets, can buy all!</p>
