          <p>The Pink Petals are quite fascinating as they tumble on the breeze. At first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before long, they turn into a great mess as they're trampled underfoot and start to decay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I gather all that I can to prevent it, though. That's just how it goes, I guess.</p>
