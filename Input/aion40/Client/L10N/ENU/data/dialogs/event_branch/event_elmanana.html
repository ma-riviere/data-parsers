          <p>Oooooh goody goody goody! Someone else who's excited to help me collect fossils for the opening of the Natural History Museum! You are, aren't you? Oh, I can just tell you are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know those plant fossils you've been getting? I need them--as many as you can get! We're starting from scratch, here, and we want our museum to be the best in all Atreia! Of course, we're offering some really good stuff in trade to those who help us get it off the ground, but we like to think that helping is its own reward.</p>

          <p>You know, analyzing these fossil fragments isn't just good for our knowledge of the ancient past, but they also help us predict shifts in the planet's crust. It's vital work!</p>
