          <p>Just look at these, Daeva. Look, look! Gojirunerk worked hard for these ingredients, food for hard working Shugos.</p>

          <p>Now they are rubbish. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonRe_21_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ClodwormRe2_21_An] will be the end of his business, nyerk.</p>

          <p>What is wrong? Twitch your whisk...sorry, Gojirunerk forgot Daevas cannot smell. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonRe_21_An]s dug up the Crimson Barrens and ruined all the vegetables and fruits!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No good for broths, no good for eating. And the smell! No one with a Shugo nose wants to trade for goods with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ClodwormRe2_21_An] flavor!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva truly cannot smell, perhaps can help to get rid of them? Gojirunerk will trade much for services.</p>
