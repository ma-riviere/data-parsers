          <p>Oh the food I had in Pandaemonium! Such variety! Such flavors! Here, everyday it's the same blasted potatoes and leeks.</p>

          <p>The crops grown near Alsig Village have a special flavor, probably because they were grown near Tripeeds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a contract with Tekor to deliver food every couple of days. But it's been fifteen days now and the growling of my stomach distorts the Aether Field readings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's undignified for an Aetheric Field Protector to seem so desperate but...I wrote a letter asking him to send the crops as soon as possible. Would you deliver it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tekor]?</p>

          <p>I make my living supplying food to the Observatory. But the harvest is late, and I have nothing to deliver.</p>

          <p>The contract doesn't pay much, so Balom has no interest in helping me fulfill it. You don't think they'd find a different supplier, would they?</p>
