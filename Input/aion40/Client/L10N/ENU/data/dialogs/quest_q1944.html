          <p>No, you are too modest. There is no doubt in my mind that your gifts deserve recognition at the highest level--the title of Cooking Expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Earning this title is a real honor, achieved only by the finest and most notable chefs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like to receive this title?</p>

          <p>Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fasimedes] is the only one who can authorize the title. It would be my pleasure to write you a letter of recommendation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a prestigious occasion and there will be a ceremony to mark your appointment. I hope you don't get nervous at such things!</p>

          <p>Perhaps you are too shy to accept such high praise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are a rare talent, [%username], but if you are to succeed me and become a master, you must receive the title of Expert. Do not recoil from recognition.</p>

          <p>Just think--how would we eat if the vegetables were too shy to emerge from the ground?</p>
