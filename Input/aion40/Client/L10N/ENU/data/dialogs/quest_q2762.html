          <p>Thank you, thank you. This would be a perfect moment if Minonerk were finished too. He's a classmate. Junjunbinerk enjoy competing with him, but he is very grumpy when he loses. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you care to help him, clever [%userclass]? I'll tell you the last material, and you can tell it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_8]. Do not say I sent you!</p>

          <p>Yes, a protrusion from a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_WaterWorm_30_An] on the Floating Island near Lake Asteria. Collect one from Zephyr Stream or the Clocktower Plain and take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_8]. And keep Junjunbinerk's secret!</p>

          <p>While Junjunbinerk was overjoyed to pass her cube-making examination by crafting a transparent cube, she was afraid that Minonerk, her fellow student, might still be struggling on his own. She asked you to give him the missing material without telling him who sent it.</p>

          <p>You harvested a Transparent Tentacle from a Mirrorglass Waterworm and gave it to Minonerk. Clever Minonerk quickly deduced what had happened, but was grateful and touched, not angry.</p>
