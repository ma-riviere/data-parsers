          <p>You think I enjoy beating and threatening Motgar?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could stand here and watch him work all day, and at the end of it, maybe he'll have half a bucket ready. Maybe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But walk over to him, threaten him with a kick or two, and suddenly...bam! "Bucket of sap for you, Dabi, just like you asked."</p>

          <p>"Encouragement"...heh, yeah. But that's the only thing that works. Motgar has no sense of working for the greater good...not for the raiders, not for Asmodae, though. He's weak in mind, weak in body.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, listen up, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dalot] is waiting on the sap so he can get started on armor for new raiders. Obviously I can't leave, or Motgar will take a nap or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you could deliver the sap for me. How about it?</p>

          <p>Remember, take the sap to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dalot]. He's been pouring blood and sweat into armorsmithing ever since he arrived--and he's fast.</p>

          <p>Maybe you think I should send [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Motgar] on this errand. You think the sap would ever reach Aldelle?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't fool yourself. Motgar is nothing but a weakling, weak in mind and weak in body. I'll have to find someone else to take the sap to the village--someone worthy of being called an Asmodian.</p>
