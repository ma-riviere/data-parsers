          <p>Ksellids and Kselliki are not dangerous animals. They never normally attack Humans unless provoked.</p>

          <p>But we just got word that a pack of them destroyed a caravan crossing the desert!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fortress is investigating, but we can't wait for the results; anything might happen in the meantime. So, we need your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>Hunt some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Shellizard_29_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardBaby_30_An]s, and bring back some samples from them.</p>

          <p>I don't know what made them so violent, but the safety of innocents must always be my first concern.</p>

          <p>Excellent! Go hunt some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Shellizard_29_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardBaby_30_An]s, and bring 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1342a]s as evidence. </p>

          <p>Not only will the area be safer, but with what you bring back we might be able to find a cause for the sudden attacks.</p>
