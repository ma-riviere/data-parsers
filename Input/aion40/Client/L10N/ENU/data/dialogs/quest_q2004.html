          <p>Time for another job...on home turf for you: the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA187].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not just a place to poach trinkets, you know. Buried deep underground is a thing they call the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2004a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This cube is a prize in itself, but its also brimming with all manner of treasure. It's just sitting there, waiting to be claimed...</p>

          <p>I'm gettin' to that. The cube is guarded by somethin' that apparently wants to keep it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whenever any of us get near the grave, the owner's spirit appears and fights us off. There's not much left of him, but he still knows how to handle himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you're made of stern stuff, [%username]. Bring back that cube, and you'll be rich beyond your wildest dreams.</p>

          <p>Ah, that's the tricky part. Head to the cemetery inside the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA187] and knock on the tombstones there. Each time you knock on a tombstone, you'll see a spirit appear. An angry spirit, if you take my meaning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thing is, it's been a while since any of us tried takin' the cube. None of us remember which tomb actually holds the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2004a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You just need to knock on the tombstones until you find the right grave, then steal the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2004a] and bring it back to me.</p>
