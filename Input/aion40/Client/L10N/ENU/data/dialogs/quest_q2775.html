          <p>Which means the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_SAMB_32_An] we've seen on the outer islands of the Garden of the Dead, The Shattered Temple, and the Garcikhan Stronghold may be more closely connected to these stones than we previously thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to check how seriously and by what the crystal inside the Wardstone is contaminated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please find and open the Tainted Guard Stones and collect the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2775a]s. Those should give us some very interesting information.</p>

          <p>Greip found out something unexpected while conducing tests on the crystals you had given her. It seems the Wardstone Crystal is vulnerable to contamination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She needed Tainted Guard Stone Crystals to understand the effects of the contamination. You destroyed several Tainted Guard Stones to collect their crystals.</p>
