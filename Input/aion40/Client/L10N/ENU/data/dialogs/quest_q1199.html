          <p>Oh, Daeva...could I speak to you for a moment? Just a moment--I won't take up too much of your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must know Sanctum well. Perhaps you came across someone I know...or, used to know. Someone by the name of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tersites]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is a Daeva like you. A fine, handsome Daeva, with wings soft and strong at the same time....</p>

          <p>Oh, excuse me. I'm embarrassing myself going on in this way. Yes, we were friends, of a sort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then one day, he just...stopped. Stopped looking at me the way he used to, stopped visiting...stopped everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hoped that my passions would be quelled in time, but it rages on, Daeva--so much that I am afraid of what I will do without him.</p>

          <p>You could find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tersites] for me. I am embarrassed to ask, but pride means nothing in the shadow of my solitude.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know he is in Sanctum. I never stop thinking of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you speak to him? Will you remind him of the woman whom he once loved so dearly, and ask him to come and see me?</p>
