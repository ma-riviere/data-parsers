          <p>Minonerk ground the item you gave me into a powder, which was used to polish the cube...so!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Feel that. Solid, sturdy, yet completely transparent! It starts with the materials, but the polish is what finishes it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Minonerk wants to give this cube to kind [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_9]. She will jump for joy when she sees this! Would you like to deliver it to her?</p>

          <p>Minonerk showed you the process of creating transparent cubes, a secret known to few besides the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Minonerk also wanted to show his first cube to Junjunbinerk and give her a letter, but was afraid because their instructor dislikes romances among his pupils.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you smuggled the items to her, Junjunbinerk was overjoyed and gave you a keepsake.</p>
