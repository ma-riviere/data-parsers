          <p>Do you know why I love books? Because I love travel, and books are the only way to get to some places without putting yourself in a perilous situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I love meeting travelers just as much, and the Guestbloom is the ultimate way to keep track of them. So, of course, they interest me as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been reading up on Guestbloom Fertilizer. It helps your Guestbloom grow hale and hearty, perfect for receiving visitors. I can make you some, if you like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I need is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_fragment_amazing_01]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_fragment_scary_01]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_fragment_lonely_01]s--one each.</p>

          <p>Apparently, the Aether contained in some gems have unique qualities that react favorably with Guestblooms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is so much we don't know about Guestblooms, though, so it's fascinating to read up on the latest news and findings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have the Aether gems I need for the Guestbloom Fertilizer, you can see for yourself what happens!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, actually, not ANY time.... I need a day to turn the ones you bring me into new batches of Guestbloom Fertilizer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please do tell me about your Guestblooms when you can. I promise I'll be the best listener ever!</p>
