          <p>Pardon me, Daeva, but do you have any plans for that Kromede's Flame yet?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you melt it down, you can compound it with the Greatsword of the Judge to make one very strong weapon.</p>

          <p>You'll need three things to do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third and final item you'll need is the Greatsword of the Judge. If you can get that mighty blade, then I can refine it for you.</p>

          <p>Consider yourself blessed by the gods, [%username]. I normally wouldn't dirty my hands on an unpaid project like this...but I'm making amends for taking Ariel's name in vain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Forgiveness has its price, you see. And since you're the first Daeva I happened upon, you'll be honored by my help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find the Greatsword of the Judge with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. Get that, and I'll do the rest.</p>
