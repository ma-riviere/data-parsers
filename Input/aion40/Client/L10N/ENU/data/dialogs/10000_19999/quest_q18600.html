          <p>I wish I could say Heiron is safer now, but it's not. It's actually worse now than ever before.</p>

          <p>In addition to the Balaur and Asmodian situations, we now have a problem with Fake Stigmas.</p>

          <p>They're being sold on the open market. Even one of my Guardians fell prey to the cheap imitations. I'm not one for depriving Daevas of cheaper prices...but these imitation Stigmas have some bad side-effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some Daevas have gone crazy after using them...others have slipped into comas. My sources tell me that the Black Cloud Traders have their hands dirty in this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, the Black Cloud Traders are in Sanctum for a union meeting. It's the perfect opportunity to find out more. Can I hire your services for this one, [%username]?</p>
