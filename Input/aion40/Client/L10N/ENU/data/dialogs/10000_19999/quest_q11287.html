          <p>The best defense is in obscurity and obfuscation, but when those things fail, we must fall back on military strategy, or even on brute force. That is why I hope you will lend your skills to our efforts, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Signs indicate that the Asmodians are no longer ignorant of Silentera Canyon. Our best efforts to cloud their eyes have failed, and now we must prepare against the eventuality that they invade Inggison through the canyon.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Agent has been dispatched to the Inggison Outpost, but if the Temple of Scales and the Altar of Avarice fall to Asmodians, we risk losing all we have worked so hard to build here.</p>

          <p>Veille is Lord Kaisinel's most favored agent. To put her at risk is to court the Lord's wrath.</p>
