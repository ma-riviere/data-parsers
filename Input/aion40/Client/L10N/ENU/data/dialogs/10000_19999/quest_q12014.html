          <p>Ouch! That's the third time I've banged my shin against boxes in the warehouse! You'd think we'd have more light, being near a volcano.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no, it's more humid than bright. And the ash darkens the skies so much, you can hardly see a thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to use torches; they're dangerous, and it's hot enough as it is. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_12014a]s are perfect: bright light with no heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get them from the remains of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Elementallight_m_spring_58_An]s. Bring me some, and I'll make it worth your while.</p>

          <p>What a disaster! I almost gave a burly male Archon plate mail made for women!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's because it's so hard to see in there. One of these days, I'm going to make a major mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's about to change... that is, if you got what I asked you for....</p>

          <p>Indeed! These alone will be enough to light the entire warehouse space!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad there are still Daevas like you out there. The front lines are important, but we supporters need aid too.</p>

          <p>This may be just a small job for you, [%username], but every little bit adds up. Thanks.</p>

          <p>You killed Brightly Glowing Spirits and got the Light Beads for her, much to her deep appreciation.</p>
