          <p>[%username], front and center! I have new orders for you. Or rather, one new order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lucius, a merchant working the Abyss, said Governor Michalis needs a table for his war room.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, unlike you lazy good-for-nothings, I got right to work and made a Round Table. My finest piece yet!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But someone's got to deliver it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lucius] in the Abyss, and I've chosen you. That is a direct order from a superior officer!</p>

          <p>Perhaps you have something for me? I don't recall ordering any supplies. I have all that I need for the moment...</p>

          <p>Oho! It's finally arrived! Let me see... ah, yes! Undin is an... odd fellow, but his craftsmanship is second to none.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must be one of his students? He drives most away with his harsh style. For you to stay... you are very dedicated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Undin will have no reward for you other than more work and abuse, so here's something for your efforts. Call it... a tip.</p>
