          <p>You've had quite the impact, [%username]. A top officer of Asmodian Scouts has come to Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_NPC_Q12052A] is now at the Basrasa Legion Garrison investigating his recent losses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a unique opportunity. With him out of commission, the Asmodian reconnaissance effort will take a major blow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill Vanguard Scout Tulin, and we will have a major advantage over the Bats.</p>

          <p>I'm glad I was sent here. I don't know how I'd be able to take being around Asmodians all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's naive if he thinks he can just force peace. But why does that argument sound so familiar...?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter. Your safe return leads me to assume that your mission was a success?</p>

          <p>You've done well. I can imagine him crying at his Obelisk over his defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if only temporarily, you've cut the head off of Asmodian intelligence. Even that short advantage could be vital.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum will hear about this, I guarantee you. Good luck in the rest of your battles here in Tiamaranta.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, you dispatched him with vigor, returning to great praise for being so tireless in working for Elysea.</p>
