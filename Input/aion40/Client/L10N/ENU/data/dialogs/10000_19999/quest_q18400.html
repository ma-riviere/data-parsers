          <p>Shards! As if we didn't have enough problems. Now we have this odd occurrence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whenever we capture fortresses in Inggison, we take local Balaur prisoners for interrogation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they disappear! No signs of forced entry or exit. They just vanish!</p>

          <p>The Aetheric fields we put up should prevent that. There must be something else going on.</p>

          <p>One of my [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDF4Re_Drana_Li_NPC]s found something, and I want you to continue the investigation.</p>

          <p>Good. We need a fresh pair of wings on this. Your arrival should infuse the energy this investigation needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're ready, go to the Altar of Avarice or the Temple of Scales. You'll meet up with either of my [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDF4Re_Drana_Li_NPC]s there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope for good news. If I can't have that, I'd at least like some not-all-that-bad news.</p>

          <p>Hrm. I suppose I should've expected that. Inggison is a dangerous place, full of drains on a Daeva's attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, who knows how those escaped prisoners could undermine our operations?</p>
