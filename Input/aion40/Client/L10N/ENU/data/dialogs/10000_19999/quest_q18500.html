          <p>I'd been investigating two seemingly unrelated cases...only to find out today that they might be connected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My first case involves missing Dukaki from the Dukaki Settlement. My lead suspects were the Krall...or so it seemed. My other case involves the underground distribution of Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two separate cases that...(whispering now) connect the Dukaki with the Skurvs. Someone is illegally producing and distributing Odium and Odella, and getting rid of anyone in their way.</p>

          <p>Just eyewitness testimony and a hunch, [%username]. A big hunch, see. Someone big is behind this, because reports say that both Elysea and Asmodae are getting squeezed pretty hard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And this latest report...this is what connected the two cases for me. Zephyros noticed something very suspicious at the Cantas Coast. If he's right, this goes beyond illegal Odium production.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you head to the Cantas Coast and confirm [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zephyros]'s testimony? Keep your gleemers peeled for clues.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll cut to the chase. The other day, I found something suspicious as I was patrolling the Cantas Coast. Suspicious Odium. Here...look. Looks like regular Odium, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wrong! Dead wrong! Take a closer look.... This Odium was made to extract Aether! It's not the method the Krall use. Someone with juice made this...someone with Kinah. Big Kinah.</p>
