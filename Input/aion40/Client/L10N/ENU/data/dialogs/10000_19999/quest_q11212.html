          <p>Ahhh, arieluma, [%username]. I thought Balaurea might be good for my research, but so far it's turned up nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could only find and kill myself a Dramata, then I could finally leave my mark in Sanctum's history books.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, sorry, my friend. You didn't come here to listen to me whine, did you? What can I help you with?</p>

          <p>Wait, is this? Could this be a Quartz of Memory? It's...it's like a book the Drakan use. It says here..."The Battle of Dramatas." Interesting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If my Balaur language skills are as sharp as I think they are, this is a manual of their war tactics! Where did you find this? This is amazing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have to take this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kerus]! He's one of Sanctum's leading scholars on Balaur war tactics.</p>

          <p>Well, well, well, the Drakan book of Dramata war tactics. I have heard that it existed, but I never thought I'd get my hands upon it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, may I study this? There is much to be learned from this manual. Much to be learned. Thank you for bringing it to me.</p>

          <p>You took it to Dramata Chaser Wivius, who then said to take it to Kerus. Kerus asked to study the Quartz of Memory.</p>
