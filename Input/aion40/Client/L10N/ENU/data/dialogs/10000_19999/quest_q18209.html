          <p>Well, well, Liberator. Back for more?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good! Since you did your thing in the Crucible Challenge, it went quiet for a while, but now we're getting reports that the Balaur are back. Some of our less competent fighters got banged up pretty good.</p>

          <p>What kind of defeatist, un-Elyos talk is that? Lord Kaisinel himself ordered that Crucible built! We're not going to let the Balaur make us change our whole plan!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, way I see it, I have the solution standing right in front of me. You've been in there a few times, and you seemed to handle yourself all right. Can I rely on you to clear out these infiltrators again?</p>

          <p>That's the spirit. Well, you know the drill by now: run through the Crucible Challenge a few times, weaken Vanktrist Spacetwine, and keep an eye out for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In]s. If you see one, I want you to go through it and take out the infiltrators before they get through.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're counting on you, soldier. Dismissed!</p>

          <p>What? You're no better than the mudslimes these infiltrators are pasting. Just go and hand victory to the Balaur right now, why don't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, if I don't find someone with more fighting spirit, I might have to ask you again later.</p>

          <p>Funny thing. Now, I'm hearing reports of Asmodians as well as draks. Can you confirm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, we've got a pretty serious breach on our hands. Can't be sending mudslimes to their deaths, can we?</p>

          <p>Thanks for doing your part to keep things orderly. Dismissed!</p>
