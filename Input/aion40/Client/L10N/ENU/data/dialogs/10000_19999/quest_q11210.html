          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I know your rigid beliefs in protecting Elysea, but I must admit that I'm glad I left the legion!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is not that I don't care about Kaisinel or his master plan.... I just don't like following orders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, I'm no mercenary--I'll protect this great land of ours, but I'll do it in my own way.</p>

          <p>Killing Drakan...winning fortresses...losing fortresses...endless battles! It's like a recurring dream I keep having.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only way to win this war is to focus on the real problem, not all these little situations that seem to pop up. Not all Drakan reach ascension. And those that don't...they become Dramata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Dramatas are only good at one thing: reproducing! They're like a plague! Dramatas are the root of the major problem here...it is they who must be killed.</p>

          <p>I've never been able to find a Dramata nest, so no one will believe me until I do...until they see how many eggs are there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could just find their nest, we could win this war and get back to living our lives. I have this feeling that the Forest of Antiquity might be a good place to start.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a lot of Drakan there, and where there's Drakan there's Dramatas. Would you help me investigate the forest, [%username]? We could save a lot of innocent lives if I'm right.</p>

          <p>Then let's begin.. Before I can start my investigation, I'll need you to help me get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C3_DrakanFi_55_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C3_DrakanFi_hero_55_Ah]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Safety first, you see. Once they're cleaned out, we can safely scour the area for the nest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're quite dangerous, so I recommend assembling a small faction to help you...unless, of course, you think you can handle it on your own.</p>

          <p>But if you're happy following orders without questioning them, then you're better off in a legion amongst other thugs.</p>

          <p>Inggison is a dangerous place for a Daeva out on his own. But I'm happier risking my life for what I believe than what Kaisinel believes...incorrectly believes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you realize how dangerous bad leadership is? It's worse than going into battle without armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, did you get rid of Basrasa Rioters and Basrasa Supervisors? Is it safe to start my investigation there?</p>

          <p>Daeva, you've really accomplished something special today. If I can find this nest, we may save many Daevas from having to go into senseless battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although they were just a small fraction of the Balaur empire, we are at least one step closer to victory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a token of my appreciation! Take it. You may not like it or want it, but please take it. You've really helped me out today.</p>
