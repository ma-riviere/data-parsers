          <p>The other elders are beginning to see the reasons behind my concerns, and it's all thanks to you.</p>

          <p>However, the instability in the ground still exists, and for the same reason: the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_2F_Spaller_56_Ae].</p>

          <p>I can't be sure, but it certainly feels like the ground is settling--in a good way, I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the first time in a while, there haven't been any serious tremors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is this because of you? Or just a pause before the storm?</p>

          <p>Ah, my mind is finally at ease.... I was starting to doubt I would ever feel this calm again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hadn't told the soldiers here about the situation yet, not wanting to cause panic. I'm glad I won't have to now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They, of course, won't be grateful for what you've done, but I'll show enough gratitude for all of them, and more.</p>
