          <p>I know the Dragonbound are supposed to be servants of the Balaur, but I never trust hearsay without confirming for myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought of a pretty clever way to find out....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The items they carry!</p>

          <p>Well, if the Dragonbound are anything like the Balaur, they'll have symbols engraved onto their items. Subversive forces can't hide their nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These symbols will tell me for sure what they really believe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that you've had some experience with them, would you go deeper into the temple and retrieve some of their items for me? Anything that has a symbol on it will do.</p>

          <p>During my research on the Lepharists, I learned that the more a culture values something, the more symbols representing it they inscribe on their items.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can handle it, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticKn_53_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticWi_53_Ae]s and loot items from each of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should hopefully shed a little light on what they really do and think.</p>

          <p>That's peculiar.... This symbol I recognize...it's a Balaur mark for death or murder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this symbol here...it's unlike anything I've ever seen. It resembles their symbol for the afterlife, but there's more to it.</p>

          <p>Well, it looks like I have plenty of work to keep me busy now. Thank you, [%username].</p>
