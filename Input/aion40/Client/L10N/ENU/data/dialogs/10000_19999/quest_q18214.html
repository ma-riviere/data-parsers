          <p>Well, I suppose if you have lowered expectations, anything seems like a success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make no mistake, I expect better from those under my watch! Would you like some advice on how to improve? And perhaps then you can have another try in the arena.</p>

          <p>In my experience, the most effective in the Coliseum are those who go all out. Perhaps they have special, unusual skills. Perhaps they pour all their efforts into survival, tricks, and tactics. Perhaps they are unflinchingly brutal, or cow their opponent with psychological manipulation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It really doesn't matter. Results are what counts. Now, go and think about your approach, and come back to me when you've defeated five opponents.</p>

          <p>Good job, I suppose.</p>

          <p>Molfus has convinced me that I shouldn't give you my next challenge. I was going to require you to get ten kills without dying yourself, but he says that's too big of a jump from the previous test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you will try that on your own time? See it as a personal challenge.</p>

          <p>When you succeeded, she refrained from giving you her next test, which Molfus deemed too difficult, but challenged you to try on your own time to defeat ten opponents without dying.</p>
