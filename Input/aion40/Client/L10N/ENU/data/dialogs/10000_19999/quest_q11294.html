          <p>Now, remember how I said I toasted the Dramata spawn? I may have fibbed a little. I only kept one--and it was the smallest one, which obviously had a while to go before it hatched. I thought maybe we could get some useful information from it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only thing is, I'm not knowledgeable enough to know what I'm looking for. I thought maybe you could take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Wivius] for me. He's one of the Dramata Chasers, and he's been studying this for decades.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a hundred percent sure it won't hatch on the way. Okay, ninety percent...</p>

          <p>Dramata eggs are very rare. Even most Balaur never get to see one in their entire lives, they are so closely guarded by the Dragon Lords. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Wivius] will be thrilled to get his hands on one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he doubts that it's really Dramata spawn, you can tell him you saw them yourself in Padmarashka's Cave!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, I hate to ask more of you, but please report the whole sad story to Agent [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cainus], even the part where I messed up. He'll find out eventually, but he'll be way more angry if I try and hide it.</p>

          <p>Yes? Do I know you? You don't look like a scholar or a Dramata Chaser, so, if you don't mind, I have a great deal of work to do.</p>

          <p>That's not a Dramata spawn. Can't be. It would be more... impressive. Surely? But, now that you mention it, the markings do look very characteristic...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You say Jamia gave you this? That little upstart! I've put decades of my life into this research, and she gets her hands on some spawn within months! I'm going to seek her out and give her a piece of my mind. Right after I get this stowed away. Hmm, I wonder if I still have that magnifying jewel? Or the corrosive potion?</p>

          <p>What, you're still here? Leave now. I have science to do!</p>

          <p>Oh, Jamia. She may be impetuous, but her sense of duty and honesty always win out. That's why I entrusted her with this sensitive task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am intrigued to know what Wivius will find when he examines the spawn. Perhaps he will find a way to detect its particular magic, so that we can trace Dramata to their lairs all over Tiamaranta. I won't bother him for a week or two, though, to give him at least some chance to investigate it.</p>
