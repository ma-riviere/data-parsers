          <p>Oh. That is... disappointing. Of course, I understand that it's a difficult mission.</p>

          <p>I'm not disappointed in you, [%username]--just anxious to find the Protector before the Balaur do. If they are able to harness the power... the destruction! There will be nothing left, [%username], and we will not even be here to mourn the death of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before you go, take this necklace. It has always kept me safe. Perhaps it will lend its power to you, as well.</p>

          <p>Daeva... You have come a long way to disturb my rest.</p>

          <p>But... you are here, so Atreia must yet stand. Tell me, Daeva--I am almost afraid to ask--do the Reian people still survive? Wait! I feel their presence still. Oh, what relief! But if Tiamat has Siel's Relics, my people will not stand for long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must not delay! We must act! We... argh! I can hardly catch my breath! Something must have sapped my power while I slumbered. Help me, strange one. My [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_10053B]s... it is likely that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Elementalking_Cristal_57_An]s took them, as they are the only beasts capable of touching my realm.</p>

          <p>My power is a blessing, [%username]. You may carry it already, but you have yet to truly earn it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is not some petty thing you may turn to your own devices. It must be used only to countermand the power of Siel's Relics. Know that retribution for its misuse could have dire consequences, least of which is the end of my own existence.</p>

          <p>While you attempted to awaken Protector Oriata, Drakan gained access to the realm and attempted to capture her. When things looked most dire, the power in the necklace Garnon gave you drove the Balaur back.</p>
