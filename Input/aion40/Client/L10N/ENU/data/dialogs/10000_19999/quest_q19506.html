          <p>You're making quite the name for yourself in Sanctum, [%username]. Charna and Bellia were just telling me how impressed they are with your skills. And I've even managed to get some of those supercilious warrior types to grudgingly admit that your magic has proved quite helpful on the battlefield. Hrumph! Pompous Sylphen!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, don't let that praise go to your head! There's still a lot to learn, young Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This war with Balaur Lords will test all Sanctum's Daevas. We must stay focused.</p>

          <p>While we've been fighting those shade-spawned Asmodians in the Abyss War, many of us have forgotten our true enemy is the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Under the protection of Aion's Aetheric Field, it's been relatively easy to keep the blighted Balaur at bay...but those days may be ending. I've been instructed to teach my students how to fight without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, students from my Temple will be able to survive without the Aetheric Field. To make them stronger, fiercer, more independent soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], do you want to join us at the Temple of Illusion and learn how to increase your powers?</p>

          <p>Good to have you on board.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple just crafted a powerful Greater Stigma. We discovered how to craft it while battling the Steel Rake, and tested it's powers in Dark Poeta with incredible results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We want to get this Greater Stigma out into the battlefield, but we can only give it to Daevas who've proven that they're capable of handling such raw power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ ten times, to prove your mastery. Then come see me again.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I can now give you a Greater Stigma without worrying that you'll blow your eyebrows off with it. I think you'll find it quite helpful in Balaurea.</p>
