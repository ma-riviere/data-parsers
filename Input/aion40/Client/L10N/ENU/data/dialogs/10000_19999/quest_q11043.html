          <p>We, the Daevas of Life, spend our days searching for ways to obtain Aether. There is no place in all of Inggison that is more abundant in this rich energy than right here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although abundant, we have recently found that collecting the Aether isn't as easy as we had first hoped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are strange creatures and fierce enemies every direction you turn in...and, even more importantly, there just aren't enough available Aether stones in this place.</p>

          <p>And once we do find the stones, we then need to purify the Aether to a high enough degree to be suitable for the Aether Cannons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes it feels like a curse to be blessed with a talent like manipulating Aether. It's an almost spiritual ability--you can't force it. It's like trying to force the sun to move.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the Brigade General of the fortress seems to think we can. He thinks we can use our abilities to manipulate these damn Aether Searchers.</p>

          <p>Precisely, Daeva. There is a limit to one's own ability...even for a Daeva of Life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which leads me to my next point.... Might you be able to lend us a hand?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to retrieve the Collecting Plates of the Aether Searchers installed not too far from here. Would you mind getting them for me? It is not as difficult as it sounds.</p>

          <p>Ah, you are my sunbreak at dawn, Daeva! I'll give you a quick tutorial. Basically, an Aether Searcher is a device that attracts Aether with its core-like component.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have...four devices installed in the area. Would you mind grabbing the collecting plates from each of them? I promise you, they're very safe.</p>

          <p>Daeva, it has been quite some time since the devices were installed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11043]s are either full or overflowing by this point.</p>

          <p>Sweet blinding light! The Aether Searchers work quite well, don't they?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The technology of Sanctum amazes me.... I never could have imagined something so advanced in my younger days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your assistance, Daeva. This will provide plenty of purified Aether for us.</p>
