          <p>The Esoterrace produces many...materials of concern to the Seraphim Lords. It's time to raid their Drazma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We still don't quite understand how Drazma works as a mutative agent, especially how it affects animate objects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So this mission has double purpose: to deprive the Balaur and to gain samples for future study.</p>

          <p>You would think so, but our needs are more specific. You see, there appear to be Dracunis at the Esoterrace MADE of Drazma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From what we know of the substance, that should be impossible. But the Esoterrace's Drazma seems to be unique somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That makes getting Drazma from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q18411] especially important.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I cannot say which Dracunis you should be targeting. They will look the same as normal ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only way to tell is to fight them. The Drazma-embedded ones will be noticeably stronger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, you'll be able to tell by the Drazma you cut from their corpses.</p>

          <p>I didn't think you were the type of Daeva to cower in the face of a little danger, [%username].</p>

          <p>But then, perhaps that's easy for me to say, safe under the watchful eyes of Kaisinel's agent.</p>

          <p>The more I think about the Esoterrace, the more I loathe it. Especially since it sounds like it was once a beautiful place.</p>

          <p>In Ariel's name, we will restore it to its former pristine state, and drive Tiamat's foul stench out forevermore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Examining the Drazma will be just one of many steps towards that goal. I assume you've brought some?</p>

          <p>I know it's difficult to find. With so many Dracunis wandering about, it's like trying to find loose Kinah at a Shugo conference.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we know they exist. I trust our intelligence on this matter. There's nothing to do but be persistent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Having that Drazma will increase our knowledge of the Balaur substantially. This is an important task.</p>

          <p>Hmmm, yes, as we thought.... This definitely doesn't look or feel like any Drazma we've encountered before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will be safely stashed and taken to Sanctum for further study. The scholars will have a field day.</p>
