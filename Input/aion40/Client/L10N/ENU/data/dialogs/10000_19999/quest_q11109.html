          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I know you've become quite partial to the Reian Tribe, but it's not wise to believe that every single one of them is friendly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure, when we first came to Inggison, we befriended them. Had a sort of pact with them. But they're about as trustworthy as this brittle land we walk upon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those Reians are very different from us. Even more so than the Asmodians, if you ask me.</p>

          <p>A peculiar race that's causing plenty of problems for us! Our scouts were riding a windstream in Silentera Canyon and discovered a strange place called the Jotun Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There seems to be some big secret the Reians are keeping from us. The Jotun are believed to be enormous stone creatures, as tall as a mountain, but that's about all we know so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The real problem is an old Reian named Aran. He won't let any of our investigators get close to the Jotun Studio.</p>

          <p>It's not just one old man...it's one old Reian man! Aran won't listen to reason! He used to be a great leader at some point in their history. Problem is, he thinks he still is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our soldiers wanted to kill him, but of course the Reian tribe strongly disagreed. To keep the peace, I sent two negotiators out to talk to him: a Reian, Gelon, and one of our own, Suleion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gelon can talk an Asmodian out of its mane, and Suleion can convince it to buy it back! Things should've been settled by now, but I haven't heard back from either of them yet. Can you find Gelon and see where we stand?</p>

          <p>I shouldn't have been so diplomatic about this. I should've just sent my legion in to...show that old Reian fart what a knife party is. No one would have been the wiser.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that damn Gelon insisted he could persuade him to leave in a calm fashion. And Suleion swore to me that he could alter his thoughts. Why did I listen?</p>

          <p>My superiors want that Jotun Studio, [%username]. They're breathing down my neck. Please, find Gelon and see what's going on!</p>

          <p>Suleion went to the Jotun Studio to speak with Aran, a former Reian leader. He is a very wise old man. He led my tribe to safety when Siel...forgot about us.</p>

          <p>It is a blessing that he is still among the living. To imagine him doing something evil is beyond my mind's grasp, Elyos.</p>

          <p>Although Suleion has not come back from Jotun Square yet, do not fear for his safety. I know in my heart that Aran would never bring him harm.</p>
