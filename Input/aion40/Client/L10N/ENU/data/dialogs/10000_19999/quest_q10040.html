          <p>We are ready. I feel Aion's hand guiding us. History will remember today as the beginning of an era of glory for the Elyos people. Today, we destroy the Dragon Lord Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Battleship_name] is anchored nearby, ready to confront Tiamat. [%username], I want you on that ship when it advances into Tiamaranta.</p>

          <p>Find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shured_LF4b], and she will secure your passage onboard.</p>

          <p>I overheard some soldiers whispering that perhaps you were afraid of flying. Hey, those are their words, not mine! You'll prove them fools in the end, I'm sure.</p>

          <p>We haven't much time. Do you fly with us to Tiamaranta, Daeva?</p>

          <p>How can you war amongst yourselves, even now? We have a greater enemy--a common enemy. Look around you! See what Tiamat's power has wrought! If you cannot adapt, you will never overcome strength like the Dragon Lord's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your people are strong, and fight valiantly. But that is not enough to defeat Tiamat. Together, though... together, we may have a chance!</p>

         <p>No. Elyos and Reian... and Asmodian. I realize that it would be the uneasiest of truces, but there is no other way. The Elyos must work with the Asmodians if they are to survive and overcome the Balaur threat.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Regardless of what you decide, I will not allow your war between Elyos and Asmodian on Reian soil. My people see enough war as it is. Transgressions will be met with overwhelming force.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Now, if you are willing, I'll send you to the Griffoen. I want you to deliver my message to your superiors. Understood?</p>

          <p>Join forces? I am glad to consider allying with the Reians, despite their impertinence. But the Asmodians?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm... we cannot defeat Tiamat alone. Elysea's future depends on the Dragon Lord's destruction. We can crush the Asmodians afterward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This man... his name is Kahrun? He doesn't strike me as an ordinary Daeva. I suppose I should speak with him myself.</p>

          <p>Convinced of victory over Tiamat, Outremus ordered the Elyos airship Eulos into Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Confident Elyos forces advanced into Tiamaranta, where they met with Tiamat's unfathomable power. The Dragon Lord had been badly underestimated. Annihilation seemed inevitable, when a mysterious ship came to their aid. The surviving Elyos were led to safety by Kahrun, leader of the Reian people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun refused to allow the war between Elyos and Asmodian on Reian soil, and insisted that Tiamat could only be defeated by a joint venture between Reian, Elyos, and Asmodian forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A hesitant Killios admitted there was reason to Kahrun's plan.</p>
