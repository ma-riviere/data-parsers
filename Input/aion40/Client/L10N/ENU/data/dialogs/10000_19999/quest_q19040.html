          <p>Arieluma. You've gained all sorts of experience since last we met, I see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I could be like you, going faraway places and having adventures. There's got to be more to life than feeding the Methus in Sanctum, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad my sister doesn't think so.</p>

          <p>Of course I do! You didn't think I was all alone, did you? No Daeva should be alone, aimless, wandering the world without family....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What about you, [%username]? Do you have family?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I rarely see [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Letia] anymore, though. She's concentrating on becoming an animal expert of sorts. Pets give her life meaning, she says. Pets! I don't understand it. Will you talk with her about them? She'd be so happy.</p>

          <p>You can find her east of the plaza.</p>

          <p>Those few times I do see her, she'll only talk about pets. It makes her so happy, [%username]. She gets this big smile on her face and exclaims over their cuteness.</p>

          <p>Neither am I. I like having the freedom to pick up and move, not worrying about being responsible for an animal's well-being.</p>

          <p>I can always make friends with the Methus here, right? Why would I need a pet?</p>

          <p>My sister is the sweetest Daeva ever! So when she kept telling me that Sanctum is awesome, I gave in and came here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, really, it's not that great. My poor pets don't get to run free and have unstructured play time.</p>

          <p>Pets are life partners! The Towers of their owners' eyes! That's why dismissing my little cuties here is rude!</p>

          <p>There's not much more to tell you, really. To understand, you need to raise one yourself.</p>

          <p>Leah stands alone at the fountain, even though her sister lives in Sanctum now, because her sister focuses on raising pets rather than on spending time with family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You met with Letia, and she told you that you'd have to raise a pet to truly understand her little cuties.</p>
