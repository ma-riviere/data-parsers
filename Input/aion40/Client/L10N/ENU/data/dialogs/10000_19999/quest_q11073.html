          <p>Though I stand sentry during the day, nighttime is MY time. When it gets dark, my energy flies up into the stars and I go out to hunt Moonflowers and Ksellids.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Except...yes, I guess I have started to feel the exhaustion set in. I truly do need to skip one of these activities, and the General will kill me if I don't show up for duty, so....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you deal with the Moonflowers and Ksellids lurking to the north of the fortress for me? Just for today?</p>

          <p>Isn't it a rush? Going to the Wildheart Grove and getting Moonflowers and Ksellids before they get you? But it's also practical.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine there's a battle with the Balaur. You touch a Moonflower or Ksellid accidentally, and you'd be poisoned before you even glimpse the enemy.</p>
