          <p>Congratulations, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You made a fine, delicate necklace worthy of presentation to the Cloister of Kaisinel. I'm sending it along with some other temple offerings I have ready to go.</p>

          <p>You have truly proven that you have the skills of a Handicrafting Master. Are you ready to accept the title?</p>

          <p>Wonderful. A talent like yours shouldn't be wasted. You'll need to go to the Cloister of Kaisinel to get High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eremitia]'s approval and acceptance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this recommendation letter to her in the Cloister of Kaisinel, and she will bestow upon you the title of Master.</p>

          <p>Are you concerned about the responsibilities of a Handicrafting Master?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you have a great gift for Handicrafting. Becoming a Master will enable you to reach even higher levels of skill. Don't think of it as additional responsibility, think of it as your ticket to more knowledge.</p>
