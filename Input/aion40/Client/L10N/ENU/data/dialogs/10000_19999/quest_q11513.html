          <p>Would you believe it if I told you that I played in the hills above us as a child? Ever since the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_000] formed, this place has twisted into something hideous and new.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the past, we would tremble if there were even a rumor that a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Cyclops_Crk_58_An] had been sighted. But now... they overrun the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_000]. What's left of the land shudders beneath their enormous weight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all the more painful to see the Petrahulks rampage in places I once knew. If you were to eliminate them on my behalf, Daeva, I would reward you.</p>

          <p>I always knew that my homeland would change, and I was not surprised to encounter hardship. We Reians have always lived in the shadow of the Balaur.</p>

          <p>But what's happened here... it breaks my heart.</p>

          <p>Thank you, friend.</p>

          <p>I know that grasping the fragments of the past only makes change harder to endure, but my memories of those hills, green and peaceful and full of adventure and stories... it's precious to me.</p>

          <p>She asked you to eliminate some of the Petrahulks crushing her memories as a personal favor. You were happy to oblige her, but when you returned for your reward she did not seem much happier.</p>
