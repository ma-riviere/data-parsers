          <p>Hmm. Interesting. It seems that the magic that keeps us from fighting the Asmodians is weakened in the Balaur legion garrisons around Tiamaranta's Eye. Lady Ariel and Aion smile upon us--this is our chance to get the upper hand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_A4], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_A4], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T4_A3], and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C3] are all beyond Kahrun's Will, but if you don't want to risk those, you could try [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C1_A2], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C1], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C2_S6], or [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C2_A1]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rid these places of the Asmodians so we Elyos can dominate. Make sure the Reians do not see you, or our efforts will be in vain.</p>

          <p>Perhaps Kahrun is right--perhaps Elyos and Asmodians can live in peace together once the Dragon Lords are defeated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They will have to abandon their dark ways, of course, and the Shedim Lords must stand trial for their crimes, but that doesn't seem impossible anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that is a matter for later, after our victory is secure. I trust you have done your part, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You've done well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Asmodians will continue to fight against us, for that is their way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We cannot let our guard down, not until final victory is ours. But thank you all the same for your efforts today.</p>

          <p>Erasmus asked you to kill Asmodians in places beyond the power of Kahrun's Will, so that the Elyos could take them over once Tiamat is defeated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you fought your hated foes, then returned to Erasmus' praises.</p>
