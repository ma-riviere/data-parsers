          <p>You were right, [%username]. I had the same nightmare as the one you told me about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was strange.... I could understand what was being said, even though they were Asmodian. This nightmare must speak directly into the dreamer's soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of this Stigma as a small child. And this child has much he wants to say, but can't or won't voice it. I believe he's either scared or very shy.</p>
