          <p>Daeva, tell me you have a moment to spare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I... I have lost everything. My barn and Qooqoo house, burnt down. My home... I saw my neighbor running aflame through my garden, Shulacks chasing after him, chattering with ugly laughter as they shot arrows into his back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the days since the Dredgion leveled [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_02], I have struggled to move on, but the sound of those Shulacks laughing fills me with such venom I fear I will never be able to let go. My request is simple, but desperate: a small measure of vengeance. Please, go to the ruins of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_02] and destroy those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_ShulackRa_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_ShulackFi_57_An]s.</p>

          <p>When I... when I left Menin I begged Aion to return me to the Aetherstream.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no. I must live. I must let go, move on, and rebuild. Thank you, Daeva, for helping me.</p>

          <p>Rotheti lost everything when the Dredgion bombed her village and the Shulack occupiers razed whatever was left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She desperately wanted to move on, but could not forget what had happened. You helped her feel a measure of closure by taking vengeance on the Shulacks in the ruins of Menin Village.</p>
