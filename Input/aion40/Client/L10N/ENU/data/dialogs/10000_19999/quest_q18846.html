          <p>Mama and Papa work with Constuck... Constru... Con-struc-tion. Do you know what that is?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They said that they make beds and tables and roofs and all kinds of things we put in our houses! Isn't that neat?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mama says that everyone who wants to live in a house should go and see her and learn about Construction and she'll give them a present! I love presents!</p>
