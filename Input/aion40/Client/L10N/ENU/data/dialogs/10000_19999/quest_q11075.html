          <p>For starters, had it not been for the Windstreams and the geysers, we'd only have our wings for transportation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those geysers are astonishing...like Inggison's netherworld is exhaling through a straw. And you can ride them straight up for hundreds of meters!</p>

          <p>Never in all my years have I found such a thrill. You must ride one of these geysers, [%username]. You'll love it.</p>
