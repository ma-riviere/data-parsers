          <p>Of course! I never pass on a new recipe. I must try it at least once before I'm satisfied.</p>

          <p>So let's test this nearly alien dish! You'll need to catch the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A5_Fungy_Cactus_51_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A5_Cellatu_Frog_51_An]s, and then get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shell_n_c_50a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shopmaterial_co_23a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can use what spices we have, but the problems are the diabolical main ingredients.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>According to the recipe, you need to bring fifteen [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11037a]s and seven [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11037b]s. You can catch the ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shell_n_c_50a]s out front, and buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shopmaterial_co_23a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Luelas].</p>
