          <p>That's a lovely plant, Daeva. I am told that Kanen "the Flamboyant" owns one just like it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you'd like to visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pesarius], Daeva. She's an expert on Blooms and other plants.</p>

          <p>Your Butler likened your new plant to those owned by "Kanen the Flamboyant." He then suggested you see Pesaryus, a Bloom merchant, to see other options.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you met her, Pesaryus said she believes in personal style and that you should get more ideas from the infamous Kanen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kanen happily told you all about plants, statues, and more!</p>
