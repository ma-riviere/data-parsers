          <p>First thing I did yesterday, I went out and got a Jukebox.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as I heard about them, I knew I had to have one. I mean, musician, musicbox. Musicbox, musician. It makes so much sense!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want one too, I think [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kaionen] still has some left at Tezz's House.</p>

          <p>Of course. Here, let me give you one, for being such a good friend who shares my troubles.</p>

          <p>Soon, we won't need Miris at all. Instead, we'll carry around Jukeboxes like this everywhere.</p>
