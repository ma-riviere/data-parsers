          <p>It's time! In hours, our life will begin anew. My thanks are owed entirely to you, dear Daeva. Thank you, so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have one last request to make of you, if you would hear me?</p>

          <p>I will take this sleeping drug and fall to my sleep, but in that sleep, I cannot raise the alarm, nor ensure my plans are carried out correctly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would like you to rouse the others. Once I have fallen unconscious, and appear dead, you must cry out so that the others are alerted. They will come, so make haste in your departure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, one last thing. I have many prized treasures in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11512_box] beside me. I will not need them after this, for I will be dressed in Aurio's love, the warmest of blankets against the coldest sky. Please, take whatever you wish! And goodbye!</p>

          <p>Both of them died! Even better!</p>

          <p>Now we just have to make it look like Aurio and Owllaet killed each other, and the whole tribe should come crumbling down in no time.</p>

          <p>Excellent work, my Elyos friend. You've done us a great favor today.</p>

          <p>Owllaet took the poison you gave her, believing that it was sleeping drug. She dropped dead, only for Aurio to emerge seconds later. Enraged, he attacked you, forcing you to kill him too before returning to Molius.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Molius was thrilled with the outcome, and said that they could twist things to look like the two parliaments were at war, thereby dooming the tribe.</p>
