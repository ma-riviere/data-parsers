          <p>We may have the fortress again, but we cannot rejoice too soon. We must strengthen its defenses as soon as we can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur still roam around the Angrief Wastes--they are planning another attack. I can feel it. They watch us...just watch us, waiting for us to drop our guard for a mere second.</p>

          <p>Please hurry. Go to the Angrief Wastes and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_11205] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C2_Spaller_mini_55_An]s. That should slow the Balaur attack down.</p>
