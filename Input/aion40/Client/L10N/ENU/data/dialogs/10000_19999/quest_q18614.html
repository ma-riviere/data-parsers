          <p>Just a shame to let Kromede's Tear go to waste like that, [%username]. Kromede would probably shed tears to see you just carrying it around like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you refine the Tear with the Spear of the Judge, it'll greatly increase its killing power! Make it damn near indestructible!</p>

          <p>Well, you'll need three things before we can begin: Kromede's Tear, the Spear of the Judge, and a very gifted blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first item and, with my legendary talent, you have the third thing. You just need the spear. If you can get that, I'll take care of the rest.</p>

          <p>You should be thanking Ariel I'm offering to help you, [%username]. I am one of the finest blacksmiths in all Elysea</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So good, in fact, that I can both enhance your spear AND tell you where you can find it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. Easy as buttering a biscuit.</p>

          <p>Have some faith, Daeva. I wouldn't tarnish my reputation by making you a shoddy weapon. Come to me with the weapon and Kromede's Tear in your Cube and I'll show you what I mean.</p>
