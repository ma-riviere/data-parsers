          <p>I thought I was just getting forgetful, but things were actually being stolen by Shulack pickpockets?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These pickpockets must have incredible skill to avoid alerting their victims every single time. I don't want to go anywhere near their hideout. I hope they get caught and disappear soon.</p>

          <p>Oh, what a relief!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping some of the Daevas would help out, but I didn't think anyone would take care of those pickpockets this quickly. You didn't recover the stolen goods though? That's too bad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since so many have had their Guestblooms stolen, the village will be inviting merchants who sell special ones to come to the village. I hope they arrive soon.</p>
