          <p>O, ho! It's the Liberator! My, but you're eager. Lining up for training, even while your comrades are sitting with their feet up sipping meon cocktails? Well, I like that in a mudslime.</p>

          <p>Of course there is! You don't think we'd waste valuable training resources on just anyone, do you? They gave me a list of candidates I'm supposed to let into the Crucible Challenge. If it were up to me, they'd slash half the names from this list. But then, it isn't up to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, they think you're up to it, and you think you're up to it... now you only have me left to convince. Are you going to try the personal training?</p>

          <p>I should think so! Now, Liberator, let me tell you what you'll be up against.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've tackled the Empyrean Crucible before, you know the drill: multiple stages of enemies, each made up of multiple rounds. And a big bad guy named Vanktrist at the end. Only, this time, there are only 6 stages, and you will go through the ordeal alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll see you back here when you have Vanktrist's blood on your hands. Uh... his illusory blood, that is. No actual enemies here!</p>

          <p>Perbano, you hear this? Mudslime's saying it conquered Vanktrist. Can you confirm?</p>

          <p>Well, well, well. Sounds like you're on the level. We have a title for people who've done what you've done: Crucible Challenger. Honestly, I didn't believe you had it in you, but I'm happy to admit I was wrong!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Crucible Challenge will be open to you again in the future, for you to hone your skills.</p>
