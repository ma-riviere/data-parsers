          <p>If the Urugugu tribe is a night sky is full of stars, Daeva, then the brightest are plainly mine and Aurio. But a dwindling, posturing energy lies directly between us, and threatens to ruin everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This star's name is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Owllau_AsQ_57_An]. He and I are betrothed to each together, forced into companionship for political gains and a base lust for power. The spark of love, which shines so bright between dear Aurio and I, cannot be extinguished for such cold, heartless maneuvering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that I ask, is that you remove Periwoo. Blow out that star, and let mine and Aurio's shine brighter than ever before!</p>

          <p>Oh hoo hoo!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The stars fell from the night sky, Daeva! What's gone is gone. The Count is dead. Love has been sprinkled with his blood, and will blossom into the strongest of trees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have prepared a poem to celebrate this occasion.</p>

          <p>"True love hath many guises, hath many dreams and hopes too. But none hath seen it stronger than in Owllaet and Aurio. Beauty and wonders alike cannot make do, Ah hoo hoo hoo hoo, ah hoo hoo hoo hoo."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Words cannot compare! Time writing poetry is wasted when it could be better spent in Aurio's arms. And now, thanks to the efforts of the Daeva before me, Aurio and I are closer than ever before. Hoo hoo!</p>

          <p>Owllaet told you about a major obstacle between her love affair with Aurio - the fact that she was betrothed to Count Periwoo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You were asked to kill him, which you did. On your return, Owllaet recited possibly the worst poem ever, and told you things were in place for their love to be realized.</p>
