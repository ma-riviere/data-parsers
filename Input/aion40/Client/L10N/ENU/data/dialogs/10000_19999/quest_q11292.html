          <p>Oh, sorry, I've just been more and more on edge the longer I have to lurk outside this Aionforsaken cave. I thought I heard something speaking Balaur. I've been convinced that Padmarashka's Protector is going to come out and spot us. If that happens, we're both done for!</p>

          <p>We don't have any time to spare. See, Padmarashka laid its spawn several days ago, and it can't be long until they hatch. All my research indicates that they can lay dozens at a time, all of them powerful Drakan from the moment they emerge, and getting stronger by the day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to get a League together, infiltrate the cave, and take out Padmarashka. If we kill it now, it can't hatch its eggs. They need constant care, so the problem should take care of itself once the Dramata is out of the way.</p>

          <p>Ah. If you're not prepared to fight Dramata, you should probably get out of here. This place is crawling with super-powerful Balaur, and if you let down your guard for just one moment, you might end up at an Obelisk.</p>

          <p>Will you at least go back to Outremus and tell him to send someone more capable?</p>

          <p>Hmm... bloodied, but not bowed. You surely can't have been involved in all that ruckus inside the cave, [%username]? I'd think you'd look much more ragged than you do.</p>

          <p>I must say I'm impressed! At least, if what you're saying is true. Others have claimed triumph, but that beast has always turned out to be alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dramatas are quite tough, so if there's even a tiny bit of life left in them, they'll recover soon enough. Still, you don't look like a liar, so I'll let you have the reward that Agent Outremus assigned.</p>
