          <p>Greetings, [%userclass]. Might I ask what you plan to do with the Kromede's Flame? It's not worth a cracked shard to a Shugo trader as it is, that much I can tell you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you let me melt it down, I can compound it with the Dagger of the Judge to make one very strong weapon for you.</p>

          <p>It requires three items, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third is the Dagger of the Judge. If you can get that, then I can do the refining for you.</p>

          <p>Consider yourself Aion blessed, [%username]. Normally, I wouldn't dirty my apron with an unpaid project like this, but I'm making amends to Ariel for some...late-night indiscretions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Absolution has its price, eh? And since you're the first Daeva I happened upon, my repentance's bounty falls to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find the Dagger of the Judge with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. You get it, I refine it, and then I'm absolved...just like that!</p>
