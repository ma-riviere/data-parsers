          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been watching you. That last robe you made had the most delicate Tailoring lines. Very impressive workmanship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it's time for you to take the Tailoring Master test.</p>

          <p>You'll just need to craft a tribute item that can be offered at the temple of an Empyrean Lord.</p>

          <p>Wonderful. And I have just the item for you to make. High Priest Eremitia from the Cloister of Kaisinel has ordered a cloth sash.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already made the design, and it complements your skills beautifully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go get the design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Proserpina]. Tell her you're there for the Master test. She'll be happy to help.</p>

          <p>Ah, you want the design for [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_19020]. Fabulous. I've got two!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first design is called Eremitia's Sash. It's less expensive, but more difficult to follow and only occasionally yields Eremitia's Noble Sash. The second design is called Eremitia's Noble Sash. It costs a bit more, but the highly detailed instructions guarantee that you'll always make Eremitia's Noble Sash, as long as your crafting is successful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which design would you like? Choose the more expensive design if you want certain results, or the cheaper design if don't mind trying your luck.</p>

          <p>Now, the design for Eremitia's Sash is volatile and can only be used once. Master Daphnis wants to keep the design tightly controlled, so she cast a self-destruction spell on it. It's quite annoying, but we've got to deal with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For only 111,500 Kinah, you could purchase Eremitia's Noble Sash instead. Eremitia's Sash costs 84,000 already.</p>
