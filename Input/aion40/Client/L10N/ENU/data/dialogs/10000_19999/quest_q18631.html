          <p>Ah, [%username]. What are your plans for the Kromede's Flame you hold? Might make a nice gift for an Asmodian lady of the night, but not much else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or...you can let me melt it down, and I can compound it with the Jewel of the Judge to make you one very strong weapon.</p>

          <p>Well, it will require three items.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first two--Kromede's Flame and a skilled, accomplished blacksmith.... That would be me, by the way, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which only leaves the Jewel of the Judge. If you can get that particular jewel, then I can refine it for you.</p>

          <p>Ariel herself has smiled upon you, [%username]. I woke up today feeling charitable, and helping a fellow Daeva should satisfy that feeling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you're the first Daeva my gaze happened upon, you shall be the lucky recipient of my charity.</p>
