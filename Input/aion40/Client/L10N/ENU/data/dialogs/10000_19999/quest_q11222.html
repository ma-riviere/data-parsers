          <p>If you go to the southern part of the Temple of Scales, you'll see a valley where the land splits into two.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aether flows freely through this area, so Daevas can spread their wings and fly to their heart's content.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's amazing to find a rich Aether spot in this Aether-deprived land.</p>

          <p>This valley is called the Conqueror's Ravine. It's where the Empyrean and Balaur Lords fought many, many years ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The force from this fierce battle split the land in half. When swords clashed, there was lightning. When arrows soared, there was rain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither side won--they both simply walked away bloodied and beaten--but the mighty weapon of the Empyrean Lord was left there in the wall of that valley ever since.</p>

          <p>A sacred weapon...and mysterious Aether still seeps from its mighty blade.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Conqueror's Ravine is a precious relic that our Empyrean Lord left for us. The Aether from it might be the only reason we can survive here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the Tricos who inhabit the area don't seem to feel the same way. Even though they're considered sacred, we still need to...remove them. Feel like Trico hunting?</p>
