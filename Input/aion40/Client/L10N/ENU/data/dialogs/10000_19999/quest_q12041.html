          <p>The Heart of Gravity now belongs to Elysea! Let Tiamat rage and tremble! Soon he will personally face our justice!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this place took a lot of damage in our efforts to conquer it. We'll need to shore it up a bit to defend against the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand that Gravity Wall Mugolems are made of a special Straight Stone that is harder than normal stone. It sounds ideal for our purposes. For the good of our war efforts, I charge you to get some for us</p>

          <p>There are some holes and weak spots in the outer walls that need to be patched.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is also talk of building a warehouse for the Legions stationed here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need material to do any of that. We need Straight Stone.</p>

          <p>Ah, yes.... Its quality is just as I'd heard. No, better! We can even add extra ramparts, and so much more!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With what we can build out of this, we'll be occupying this fortress for the next millenium!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat has been dealt a grave blow, and we didn't even fight him! My thanks to you, [%userclass].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and a delighted Lilia was already planning how to use the stone you'd brought her.</p>
