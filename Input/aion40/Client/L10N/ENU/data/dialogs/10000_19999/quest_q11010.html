          <p>You think so? Hmm.... Anyway, I didn't actually ask you over here to listen to me vent. I need a favor. There's this Daeva of Nursing who works here at the Fortress. Her name is Naiting.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>I don't know why she came out here; she looks like a spoiled city kid. I figured she'd only last a few days, but she's been here for quite a while now.</p>

          <p>She's amazing. As soon as she started working on our wounded, our recovery times improved exponentially. I have no idea how she does it. It's phenomenal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she's working herself too hard. She's not sleeping or eating enough, and she's always covered in blood and dirt. It's...distressing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you pop over there and give her a hand for awhile?</p>
