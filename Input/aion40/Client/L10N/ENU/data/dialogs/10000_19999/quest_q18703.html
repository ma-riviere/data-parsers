          <p>Incredible. If we can study the Balaur life cycle from the beginning, we may discover more about how to defeat them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is quite cold, though. Perhaps exposure to the warmth of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDRaksha_ItemUseArea_Q28703] might help.</p>

          <p>Don't worry; this egg is hardier than mere lava. Give it a try, then return if something happens.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes. That sure did the trick. The egg is nice and warm now. And whatever's within is definitely alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But time's taken its toll; the life force is weak. We must shore it up, or it'll be of no research value to us.</p>

          <p>I suggest the [%dic:STR_DIC_FOBJ_IDRaksha_mandali]. It's a hardy plant that may bloom somewhere in Raksang.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so hardy because of the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18703g] within it. Find and extract it, and bring it and egg to [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Amis].</p>

          <p>As one experienced in pets and hatching eggs, I would expect she would best know how to proceed from there--or at least knows who would.</p>
