          <p>Say, [%username], remember the Kromede's Flame necklace I gave you? What are you going to do with it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Haven't thought about it yet? Well, did you know you can melt it down and compound it with the Longbow of the Judge to make a curiously strong arrow shooter?</p>

          <p>Yes, yes. You'll need to get it first. You'll need three things, actually.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third and final item you'll need is the Longbow of the Judge. But you'll need to pry it from its owner's hands first.</p>

          <p>No need to thank me, [%username]. I have the easy part in this transaction. You, on the other hand, have the hard part: getting the longbow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to take it from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. And she won't be too thrilled to see it go.</p>
