          <p>Anusis and I worked together in the Artisans Hall in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We designed a lot of powerful pieces in those days, and also learned a lot about precision. He made me this hair pin, and I made him a number of brooches with blue gemstones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He probably doesn't wear them anymore.</p>

          <p>Mmmm, look at that gorgeous mace. Laestrygos always had an eye for detail. He made me these brooches, you know. I bet he doesn't wear the crude hair pin I made him anymore....</p>

          <p>Enough reminiscing! You want the mace and the Aegis merged, you give me 8,000,000 Kinah. Up front. If you think that's too expensive, go find someone else.</p>

          <p>Most craftsmen can go fifty mortal lifetimes before seeing an Piece of Aegis. Wow. Look at the colors. If you just reach out and.... Oh! Oh! Hello there, Piece of Aegis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me just close my eyes and commune. Mmmmmm. It's in my soul. I can practically feel the vibrations right down to my....oh, yeah....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And here's Laestry's Mace. It feels just like...oh...just like him...ahhh! So, [%username], what do you think of your new mace? Do you like it?</p>
