          <p>Here's my trouble: do you know what Hascals are, [%username]? They're a new breed of Balaur, probably descended from Nagas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're cruel and vicious. We've encountered them for the first time here, but who knows how far the Dragon Lords will spread them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must discover as much as we can about them: their strengths, weaknesses, skills, the whole lot. I've tried, with little success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to ask you to fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_NagaGaurdSc_59_An]s and report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Canopus] with your impressions and findings.</p>

          <p>You've returned. I hope you're here to tell me you found Grant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a good operative. His silence is the very reason I sent you in the first place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, give me your report.</p>

          <p>Hascals, eh? I'd heard of them from some of my troops but never encountered one in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Grant won't return until we know everything about the Hascals. It's a little off his mission, but I agree this is important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your information is a good start, though. Thank you for assisting in Grant's work.</p>

          <p>Grant told you about Hascals, a new breed of Balaur. He'd been trying to find information on them, with little success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you fought Naduka Hascal Snipers and reported your impressions to Canopus, who thanked you for the vital intelligence.</p>
