          <p>Boreas and Macus have spoken very highly of you, [%username]. Your abilities are already quite renowned in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But remember, a war with the Balaur Lords remains the true test for any Daeva. You must remain pure, as you were in the beginning. That is the only way to have the strength to beat the wicked Balaur.</p>

          <p>While we Elyos fought the Abyss War, I think we forgot that our true enemy was the Balaur. We focused all of our skills on fighting the Asmodians and no one else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this will all change once Empyrean Lord Kaisinel makes his decision. We, the followers of Ariel, will have to become stronger to fight for Sanctum without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Lords have ordered me to train my students at four Temples in glorious Sanctum to give them the chance to become stronger soldiers. How about you, [%username]? Care to learn the teachings of the Temple of Justice and gain new powers...new strengths for battle?</p>

          <p>What the Temples offer is a Greater Stigma. We saw the potential when we took care of Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't simply bestow a Greater Stigma on every Daeva. They're too potent. You have to prove you are capable of wielding its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Gladiator, you can use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ, right? Well, you must use this skill 10 times to prove that you are ready. Go do this and then come back to me. Then you will be ready.</p>
