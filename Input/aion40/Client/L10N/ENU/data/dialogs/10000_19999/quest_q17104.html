            <p>The village is planning a platform to add decorations to the fountain.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>This platform will accent and display the fountain, but we need materials. Bring [%dic:STR_DIC_E_junk_town_upgrade_seasonlight] to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Town_shugo_Worker_05] to add seasonal flavor to the fountain's decorations.</p>

          <p>Decorating fountain to reflect season will make it much more beautiful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look over here, please. First, pillar is placed in center over there, then platform on which beautiful plants can grow is added! Will make village at least ... 20% more beautious, nyerk, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plants on platform are different from flowers in flower beds. We need Season's Light to keep the fountain plants blooming in every season.</p>

          <p>Wonderful! Daeva has brought exactly what we needed. Not many Daevas seem to have met the right Agrints to bring this to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, perhaps Daevas in village just are not interested in prettier fountain? No, must be bad luck, akakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fountain will be much prettier soon.</p>
