          <p>Do you know anything about the one called Sulinia? She has been searching for Paris for some time now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The reason I ask is I have the Inggison Jacket, crafted personally by his skilled touch. How did I get it? It's a long story that I'll spare you for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it does me no good.... It only reminds me of a lost friend. So I'd like to propose an offer to you, Elyos.</p>

          <p>I have a debt to settle with the Balaur...those damned Balaur! You see, they slaughtered my family long ago. Not just my family, but countless Reian families.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My people are now small in number, and we lack the strength to stand up to Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need arms, armor, scrolls. For that, we need Kinah.</p>

          <p>Indeed. The Shugo pay top Kinah for [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11055a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11055b]s--they are used in blacksmithing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get them from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_DrakanKn_54_Ae]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_NepilimWalker_53_Ah]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_NepilimGuard_53_Ah]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can find enough of them for me, I will give you the Inggison Jacket. I would also like to request 200,000 Kinah from you...a start for our fund to arm ourselves against the Balaur.</p>
