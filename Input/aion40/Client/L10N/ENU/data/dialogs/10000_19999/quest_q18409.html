          <p>It seems that while you were gone, Tillen contacted his higher-ups in Sanctum. A lot of discussion followed before he got orders from some of the top generals.</p>

          <p>I understand exactly how you feel. Meddling with the power of a Dragon Lord for our own purposes...doesn't seem right somehow.</p>

          <p>Well, Sanctum will need to know to assign this to another Daeva. They may want you to brief him or her beforehand.</p>

          <p>Ahem. At any rate, I need you to see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ukon], the smith. He already has the hilt and can tell you what needs to be done.</p>

          <p>And this power...is this the power of a Dragon Lord? If you're not at least a little frightened by it, you're a fool.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the shattering caused a power drain. Sanctum suggested you take the sword to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDTemple_Low] and defeat Debilkarim the Maker to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The surge of energy produced by Debilkarim's defeat is apparently enough to "light the spark" within Tiamat's Power. Good luck!</p>

          <p>They weren't sure what it was, but I knew. It was a feeling of power renewed. Tiamat's power, I'll wager.</p>

          <p>Amazing. To even hold such a thing.... And best of all, Tiamat can't use it to spy on us, as Surama took care of that already!</p>

          <p>Veille needs to see this. She'll know what the Seraphim Lords wish to be done with it now.</p>

          <p>Ah, your reward. None of these weapons quite match up to Tiamat's Power, but they are mighty nonetheless. Take one with great thanks.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ukon reforged the sword, but said it had lost most of its power. You had to defeat Debilkarim the Maker in Lower Udas Temple to restore it completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed Debilkarim and took the fully restored Tiamat's Power back to Tillen. He praised you mightily and gave you a generous reward.</p>
