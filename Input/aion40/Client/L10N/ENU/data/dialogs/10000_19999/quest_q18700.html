          <p>Let me tell you about Raksang. It's a prison where Tiamat imprisoned Raksha, a mighty dragon-turned-rival.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Reians believe Tiamat is planning to free Raksha once more, promising him power in exchange for fighting us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Raksha will take that deal, if only to destroy the lowly Human race before challenging Tiamat once more.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, and it may lie with a Reian named Hiel. He was kidnapped by the Balaur, then rescued near Raksang, his memory erased.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand he's now disappeared, saying he regained some of his memories, and was going to "take care of everything."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I for one am sure it's related to Raksang, especially with the massive Aether and Drana surges there we've detected. We need someone to investigate.</p>

          <p>Hiel is an expert in sealing magics. We can only assume he was originally kidnapped to apply that expertise within Raksang.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must find him there, wherever he is. Pry what memories you can from him and give whatever aid he might need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Arza is an old friend of Hiel, and knows Raksang as well as anyone. She'll show you how to get there.</p>

          <p>I know this is a lot to ask based on rumor and hearsay, but haven't you done more with less?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bringing a Dragon of Raksha's power into this war does not bode well for us. But it's risky to Tiamat as well. The Dragon Lord must be feeling pressured to take such drastic measures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If there are other things you must do, do them, but return to this mission again. It could hold the key to keeping Tiamaranta.</p>
