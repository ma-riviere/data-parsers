          <p>Ugh. I'm so tired of staring at the ground whenever I decide to go somewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_SandShark_58_An]s, [%username]. They hunt just below the sand, and pounce up when they sense nearby movement. The only tell-tale sign is the shifting sands above them, but it's not a tell we can ignore. Just yesterday I saw one of yours dragged under the sands in the jaws of a Zanthay. I can still hear her screams...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You couldn't kill them, could you? We can't afford to lose any of our guards, and the Zanthay issue is distracting everyone from their actual jobs.</p>

          <p>The Hushblade Legionary Rakya was worried after seeing the Rock Blade Zanthays attacking refugees with increasingly frequency. She asked you to go out and kill the Zanthays before the problem got even worse, which you duly did.</p>
