          <p>She's a lot kinder than I am, greenhorn, because she thinks you're actually worthy of the Construction Master test!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd better remember MY reputation is on the line as well as yours! But if any of the Elrocos I call my students can do it, I suppose it would be you.</p>
