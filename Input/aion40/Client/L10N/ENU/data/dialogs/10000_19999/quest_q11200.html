          <p>We cannot do this on our own! We have lost the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A], and I watched as many of my comrades fell to the blades of our sworn enemy!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must strike! We've already dispatched several legions to reclaim the Altar, including Kaisinel's Shadow Legion. But we still need more soldiers...we need [%userclass]s!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was told to seek help from the Angrief Observation Post if our situation became dire. Well, our situation has become dire, [%username].</p>

          <p>If we delay any longer, we may lose the Temple of Scales as well. Empyrean Lord Kaisinel is doing what he can, but it's only a matter of time until the Balaur and Asmodians break through our defenses.</p>

          <p>Please, [%username], help us reclaim the Altar of Avarice! We need to break through the line of enemy guards so our forces can get through....</p>

          <p>We need you to go there and kill off as many of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_11200all] as soon as possible! The Altar of Avarice is in your hands, [%username].</p>

          <p>We must reclaim the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A]! When you see your chance, when their defenses are weakened, you must eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_11200all] to break through!</p>
