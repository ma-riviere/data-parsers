          <p>Ah, [%username]. It took quite some time, but I was finally able to talk to Aran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I looked deep into his eyes and let my mind become one with his...or, attempted to, at least. But his mind was like a stone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A stone weathered by a world of pain. His soul has deteriorated and his will broken...he is himself no more. He must be stopped.</p>

          <p>Yes, stopped. Don't make me spell it out, [%username]. He protects the Jotun Studio because within its walls is a powerful device.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This device holds the power of the ancient days. Aran wants to use it to cast his vengeance on the Elyos...this much I could read from his bitter mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He blames us for Aion's Tower falling, for Lord Israphel and Lady Siel Displacing, for leaving his people to rot in Balaurea.</p>

          <p>He doesn't see the truth any longer.... He only sees what he wants to see. Time has distorted the soul of this once great leader of the Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is impossible to persuade him otherwise. There is no longer any light in his spirit.</p>

          <p>The Reians will be furious, but you must relieve him from the shackles of his hatred. You must kill him, [%username].</p>

          <p>I feel for Aran, and I understand his plight. I was supposed to assassinate him if I could not persuade him...but I cannot, my friend.</p>
