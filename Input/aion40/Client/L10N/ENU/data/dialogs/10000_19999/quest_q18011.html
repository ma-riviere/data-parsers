          <p>Hmm... A strange rumor is going around inside the castle. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Supposedly there's screaming going on somewhere at night. At first, I thought it was the sound of the wind the people got confused with. But since every guardian on duty had the same report, we should probably check it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, there's one thing that I'm thinking of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Gadoron and tell him the circumstances and see if the screaming has to do with what he's investigating.</p>

          <p>You were sent by Centurion Tenitian. The screams? That's fairly simple to explain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This fortress in the plain has Tiamat's laboratory. That's where they studied the source of energy of ancient weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I'm right, the sounds should come from there.</p>
