          <p>Silion's weaponry may be powerful, [%username], but like most things, it can be upgraded. That bow of yours is no different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, it can't be upgraded with thin air and sheer willpower. You'll need an item, an all-seeing bit of goo that empowers your weapon... somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm talking about [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18711A], which, naturally, Paruam isn't inclined to part ways with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, if you're able to collect it, head to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lagia] and you'll end up with a fair bit more bite in your weapon. What do you think? Interested?</p>
