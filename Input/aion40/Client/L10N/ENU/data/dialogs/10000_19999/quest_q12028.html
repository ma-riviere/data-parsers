          <p>[%username], we all know this alliance with the Asmodians is ridiculous. They're Asmodian, for Kaisinel's sake; they understand peace about as well as the brax understand economic elasticity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sooner or later, Tiamat will die. And, when he does, we'll be thrust back into war with the furbacks. Our high council have discussed this inevitability countless times, and have authorized a secret assignment that I've been ordered to give you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDLDF4b_Tiamat] and kill every Asmodian you see. We can only send single Daevas who we can later pass off as lone warriors, and we all know you're capable of handling yourself. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Ruonas spoke to about the false peace that reigned over the Asmodian and Elyos forces. She suggested that it wouldn't last once Tiamat was defeated, and suggested the Elyos start gaining the upper hand by thinning out their numbers now. You went alone, and did as you were ordered.</p>
