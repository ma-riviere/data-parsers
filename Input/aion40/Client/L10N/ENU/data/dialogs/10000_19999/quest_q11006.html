          <p>Isn't it wonderful? I've been asked to do something more than just carry messages! I'm going to check on the Obelisks near the forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since this is a key Aether-collecting area, the Obelisks need to be maintained with special care.</p>

          <p>We'll find traces in the water if the Obelisk is functioning correctly, so I could give you some glass bottles to draw water from the [%dic:STR_DIC_QW_LF4_SZ_A1_Q1] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_A5].</p>

          <p>Sure, we could detatch the Obelisks and examine them individually, but this way is much simpler.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's do them one at a time, all right? That way, I can check the first bottle of water while you're getting the next one.</p>

          <p>And it's a good thing! I can tell that there's an above-average concentration of Aether in this bottle as well. The Obelisks in both places seem to be working perfectly.</p>

          <p>Clodia was excited to check whether the Obelisks installed near the forest were functioning correctly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You helped her by collecting water samples from the Calmheart Grove and Dimaia Fountainhead. She said the Aether concentration in those samples was above-average and that the Obelisks were functioning beautifully.</p>
