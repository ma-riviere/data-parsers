          <p>What? Why don't you want the title? Is it the thought of having to go through a ceremony?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have a great passion for Tailoring and becoming a Master will open the doors for you to access greater and deeper Tailoring knowledge.</p>

          <p>It's just one ceremony. Surely you can manage to survive in order to gain such knowledge?</p>
