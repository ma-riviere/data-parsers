          <p>This place is overflowing with Aether energy.... Taloc seems to absorb it like a sponge, and then it gets passed onto the creatures around it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which means...to collect this Aether we must first collect it from the creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to harvest the Aether Gems formed in their bodies.</p>

          <p>Ah, thank you, Daeva. I seem to find myself in your debt more and more these days. I will give special mention to you when my thesis gets published.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have discovered that the Aether energy is strongest in [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Dionaea_Od_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Rottentree_Green_52_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure what form the Aether takes inside these creatures, but it registers quite heavily within them. Whatever form, we need to collect it.</p>

          <p>Daeva, I was worried about you...it's been quite some time since you first left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did the Aether harvesting from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Dionaea_Od_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Rottentree_Green_52_An]s turn out? Was it as we had hoped?</p>

          <p>We may lose this war with Tiamat if we cannot collect enough Aether. And, more importantly, I will not get published if I have nothing to write about!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, Daeva, go and harvest the Aether from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Dionaea_Od_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Rottentree_Green_52_An]s. You must hurry. And maybe take notes....</p>

          <p>Curse the shadows! This Aether is contaminated! It's murky and tainted with some strange color.</p>

          <p>Hmm, but it may still work for the Aether Cannons, though. I will have to purify it several times, but it may still work.</p>
