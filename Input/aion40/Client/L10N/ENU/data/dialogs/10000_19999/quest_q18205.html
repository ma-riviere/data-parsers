          <p>Here's a tip, Liberator. Don't get too caught up in what you think you know. Battle is all about surprises, even though your commanders prepare you as best they can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you should know that the final sparring partner for Stage 10 is not a Balaur from Dark Poeta. Instead, you'll face the Vanktrist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We found him in the Aetheric Field, and none of my charges have defeated him yet.</p>

          <p>He didn't believe me, so we made a bet. I had 550 Kinah on you.</p>

          <p>If even half of that story is true, you're the best trainee to graduate from the Empyrean Crucible yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If none of it's true, you're still among the proud few who've completed Stage 10. That's something to be proud of and the reason why Chief Walzen asked me to bestow this title upon you. He regrets that he couldn't give it to you in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With talent like this, you'll handily defeat any Balaur legion!</p>
