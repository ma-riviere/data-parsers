          <p>Greetings, [%username]. I'm curious...what are you going to do with your Kromede's Flame? Might be able to get a little bit of Kinah for it on the market, but I have a better idea....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can melt it down and compound it with the Spear of the Judge to make one very strong, very potent weapon.</p>

          <p>You'll need three things to accomplish this, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which we've established you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, you'll need the Spear of the Judge. If you can take that mighty weapon from its owner, I can refine it for you.</p>

          <p>No need to thank me, [%username]. I have the easy part in this transaction. You, on the other hand, have the hard part: getting the spear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to take it from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. And good luck with that.</p>

          <p>You must have heard of me, Daeva! I'm Ukon...the legendary blacksmith Ukon, from Sanctum!</p>

          <p>You're turning me down? No one turns me down.... I turn other people down!</p>

          <p>Fine! I'll just find another Daeva! Anybody else would jump at the opportunity for my help.</p>

          <p>Here, take your Kromede's Spear. Just as I promised...stronger and sharper than ever. Don't go throwing it at stone walls now, [%username].</p>
