          <p>Strange, strange. These beaks you brought back? Definitely Bluetail Crestlich beaks, but they're all no different from any other.</p>

          <p>Imagined it? No, I definitely heard a Crestlich talk. I wish I could describe it better.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was so peculiar looking, but it was running too fast to make out many details. Maybe.... You know, I have a sneaking suspicion that it might have been [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A1_Crestlich_NamedQ_52_n] I saw.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a particularly large Crestlich I've heard the Reians talk about. Care to go on another hunt?</p>
