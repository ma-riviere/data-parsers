          <p>Oh...arieluma, Daeva. I'm supposed to be researching the impact of Tiamat's breath on this land...but I haven't made much progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you guess why? Look around.... It's those damn Pucas!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only are they strong, but they're smart, too. They hide, they steal our equipment, they attack our investigators.... Those damn Pucas!</p>

          <p>Would you help me out, fellow Daeva? Would you kill as many of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Bookie_Stone_53_An]s as you can for me? For my research?</p>
