          <p>All of Elysea is buzzing about Oriel! It is, as the children put it these days, "shinyriffic!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahem. Perhaps I should leave the slang to them. But it really is a beautiful place where a Daeva can establish a retreat worth returning to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Polyidus] can teleport you there. Meet Information Officer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Leejunius] once you arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He can tell you all about Oriel and everything it has to offer. I can guarantee you'll at least want to listen.</p>

          <p>It's a place for all Elyos, home owner or not, to revitalize themselves for a while, far from the hectic wars.</p>

          <p>It is. This is a place where people and events amble by at their own speed. It's the perfect place to make a home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas who rest here return to the battlefield feeling like they could take on the Shedim Lords all by themselves.</p>

          <p>Relax! Let your cares wash away under the bright, beautiful sun. Enjoy the world Aion has made for you.</p>
