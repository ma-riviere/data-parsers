          <p>Thank you. Lord Kaisinel gave my legion the special ability to make an Illusion Fortress, and we were almost overwhelmed at first. We built this fortress with painstaking effort and plenty of spilled blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to constantly maintain the illusion, lest we lose the Fortresss to carelessness. A small mistake could split the illusion into shards, much like Tower of Eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go out and build an accurate picture of the illusion's health while familiarizing yourself with the area?</p>

          <p>This will be part "surprise inspection" and part "chance for Wisplight to show off to the new resident".</p>

          <p>May I suggest you see Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gellius], Legionary [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aiola], and Alchemist [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phailos]? Admire their work while hunting for anything they've failed to report.</p>

          <p>Knowing that you know nothing about the illusion, you won't put yourself in the position of passing judgment on it. I'm impressed, [%username].</p>

          <p>But the true exercise is less about judgment, and more about knowing where things ought to be when running smoothly. Are you sure you won't go?</p>

          <p>The Brigade General has told us to do what we can, and--while I appreciate his trust--I'm under immense pressure. I need twice the men, twice the resources, basically twice everything.</p>
