          <p>You're studying me closer than most. You're paying attention to my facial muscles, my breathing, my blinking, my eye contact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I didn't know better I'd be flattered. But no...you're studying my face. You're looking for a truth, suspicious that I won't simply say it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should let me teach you to refine your knowledge. I am a Daeva of Emotion. I know little else in this world.</p>

          <p>Excellent. An apprentice!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, we'll start by having you read this book. I wrote it myself, and it teaches the basics of expressing emotion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, knowing and expressing your own emotions is an important first step in reading and understanding them in others.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You read Andreas' Manual, which argued that spontaneous expressions are most important, and learned about expressing yourself through motions.</p>
