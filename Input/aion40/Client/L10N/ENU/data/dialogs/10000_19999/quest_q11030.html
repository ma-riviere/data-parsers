          <p>[%username], have you seen Mosswing around these parts? It's a Wraithling that's been tearing Daevas up around here. The Hushblade Legion is looking for it, but they've turned up nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Hushblade Legion...they make me so damn angry! They always come in high and mighty then leave halfway through the job! They never finish anything they start.</p>

          <p>You've got a good system there. I wish Armond worked alone. He's the one that really...angers me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He'll begin something, take all the glory, then he'll have the Sanctum Expeditionary Force put their lives on the line and clean up the dirty parts.</p>

          <p>You know, [%username], I bet when they can't find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A4_Vampire_NamedQ_52_An], they'll make us do it.</p>

          <p>So...I have a plan. What if we caught [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A4_Vampire_NamedQ_52_An] first?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could shove it in Armond's face if we caught that Wraithling first! Finally show the Hushblades that my Sanctum Expeditionary Force is the best!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it? Can you give us a hand here?</p>

          <p>Considering that the Hushblade Legion has been looking for him for days now, this may be a bit more difficult than you expect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'll share a secret with you--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A4_Vampire_NamedQ_52_An] can hear them approaching. Its hearing is so sharp, it can pick up a whisper in a windstorm. That's why they can't get him!</p>
