          <p>The Balaur will be unable to regroup and resupply, but we must continue to pound them...sever their throat from both sides.</p>

          <p>First and foremost, infiltrate the Chantra Dredgion and pound it like a fist. Do not let up for one second!</p>

          <p>The second string of this operation is to hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanFiHigh_55_Ae]es and eliminate them...with extreme prejudice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With enough constant assaults, and the winnowing of one of their key troop types, we may finally gain the upper hand.</p>
