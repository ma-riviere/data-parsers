          <p>So, Asmodian, what's the situation in Heiron now that the Balaur have taken the Observatory?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I know about it--Daevas of Zephyr are intelligence agents. We make a point to stay informed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now I need more information--what's the story?</p>

          <p>Hmm. The Bakarma Legion must be stronger than we thought--and they have something up their sleeves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I better wrap things up quickly here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], could you help me? I came here to gather information on the Indratu Brigade General and other leaders, but the Nagarants have kept me away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you take on the [%dic:STR_DIC_A_IDLF3CI_1517a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_A_IDLF3CI_1517b]s? Then I can infiltrate the fortress.</p>

          <p>It looks like every warrior's been assigned a mage. You should probably find some allies to go with you to defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_A_IDLF3CI_1517a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_A_IDLF3CI_1517b]s.</p>

          <p>It's almost certain that a force will head out from Indratu to Beluslan before long. Isn't it obvious what will happen then?!</p>
