          <p>Have you considered why the Temple of Life assigned you these tasks? Ever looked to the higher purpose?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lady Yustiel is worried that Clerics and Chanters might be forgetting what the meaning of Life is, that they might be losing sight of our true mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I don't believe we've entirely forgotten her teachings. Still, during times of stress, Daevas may be distracted from serving those we need to help most.</p>

          <p>[%username]! Young disciple of Empyrean Lady Yustiel, the disciples of Life must go forth now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Elysea is suffused with rage--toward the Balaur, toward Asmodians.... Hatred devalues all life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return to your place of duty. Give salvation of Life to those who have fallen, and return after you have spread our teachings.</p>
