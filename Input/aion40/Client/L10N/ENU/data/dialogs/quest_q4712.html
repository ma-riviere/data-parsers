          <p>You've distinguished yourself, [%username], and displayed exactly the skills I need--so I have another mission for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much of what we know about the Dredgion we owe to a small band of scholars and the Archons protecting them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've risked their lives time and again--their work made it possible for you to infiltrate the ship for us.</p>

          <p>It does indeed, and it puts us in their debt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even as you were sabotaging the Dredgion, we learned that several scholars and Archons have been captured and are now being held prisoner there. We're told they've gathered new information since their last report, so that must be recovered as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you willing to rescue the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDAB1_Dreadgion_prisoner_dark]s from the Dredgion?</p>
