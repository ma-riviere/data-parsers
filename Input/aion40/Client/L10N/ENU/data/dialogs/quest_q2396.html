			<p>Hi! Are you new here, too? This village is...it's just fascinating.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>Ah, but I'm sure you know that. And you aren't here to chat--I can see that in your face. You've come to trade coins. Well, I have two kinds of reward items for Gladiators, Templars, Assassins or Rangers.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>It really depends on how experienced you are at your craft. Would you like to trade for something now?</p>
