          <p>Defeating Life Reapers is a trivial mission in itself, yet it is essential to recapturing the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does that sound contradictory to you? The best laid plans require everyone to do their part--whether they like it or not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I won't beg. If you are afraid of the spectres so be it--and be gone!</p>
