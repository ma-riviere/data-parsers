          <p>I got bad luck. Real bad luck. I promised Krodis I'd find him some Mandrake. I was so sure I'd find some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I searched all over and got nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I gave up in the end. Came back to this rock right here. Then I got a hunch, and looked under it, and would you guess what I found?</p>

          <p>A whole bunch of 'em! Real fat ones too!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I gotta get 'em back to Krodis before they go bad. They go bad real quick once you pick 'em, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I promised little Eradis back in the village I'd fetch him some herbs, and I gotta keep that promise. Don't suppose you'd take the Mandrake to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA157] for me, would ya?</p>

          <p>Okay. Here's the Mandrake. It's already shrivellin', you better hurry!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get it to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA157] quick as you can. If he wants it to grow, he needs to get it into the soil right away.</p>

          <p>If it dries out, just come on back and I'll give you another.</p>

          <p>When I had a headache, my grandmother used to mix me up some Mandrake juice. Tasted horrible, but it worked.</p>

          <p>Come on, my lovely. Into the soil with you. There we go...</p>

          <p>Thanks, Daeva. If this gets growing, I'll have fresh Mandrake whenever I want!</p>

          <p>Gano was asked to bring Mandrake to Krodis, but he was busy gathering other herbs and was afraid that it would wither before he delivered it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took the Mandrake to Krodis before it dried out.</p>
