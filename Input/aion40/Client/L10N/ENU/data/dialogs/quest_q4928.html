          <p>You know that only Daevas can use Divine Power skills, right? But you can't use them as often as you might like. That's why many Daevas are still inexperienced with Divine Power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The test is an incentive proposed by the Governor to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They call it a test, but it's really more of a training program. It ends when you use a chosen skill ten times. Would you like to try the Divine Power Test?</p>

          <p>You're a Cleric? Then you must have learned the Acquittal skill. If not, you should.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That skill will be the subject of your Divine Power Test. Return to me when you've used the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DP_Pr] ten times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck!</p>
