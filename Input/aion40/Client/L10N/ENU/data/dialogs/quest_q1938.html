          <p>So...the clues suggest that the fake Stigma Stones originate from the Abyss?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is going to require a proper investigation. Can you imagine the consequences if we sent out Legions equipped with fake stones? They would be massacred! Their blood and souls would be on our hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, I will not allow that to happen. We must fix this, now.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A seasoned veteran like yourself is just the Daeva to head up our investigations. No one will dare hide the truth from you. Of course, if they did, then I'm certain you'll be able to--ahem--discover the truth.</p>

          <p>I trust you, [%username]. Don't let us down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first task is to find out more information. I know a Shugo at Teminon Landing, a tricky little opportunist named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_L1], who's got her paws in more pies than I care to count. She's quite knowledgeable about such unsavory things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nayorinerk may not be forthcoming with answers, but we don't have time to play nice here. If you think she's holding back information... Well...I'm sure you know what to do.</p>

          <p>We can't risk ignoring this dilemma, [%username]. Our Legionaries' lives are at risk every day these fake Stigma Stones remain in our inventories. As it stands now, our market is flooded with fakes.</p>
