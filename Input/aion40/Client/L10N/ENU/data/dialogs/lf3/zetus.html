          <p>He picks the graveyard where he will be buried and prepares himself to depart from his beloved family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though this village has been devastated, this is where my wife and I wish to be buried. So no matter how dangerous it gets, we're not leaving.</p>
