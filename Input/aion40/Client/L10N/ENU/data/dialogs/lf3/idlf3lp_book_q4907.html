          <p>Procedural Log: Transplanted Slime's poison organ to 10 Humans. 5 subjects expired. Remaining subjects suffered high fever and blue skin discoloration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Discoloration and fever subsequently diminished, being absent from all subjects by day 15. Four subjects suffered deafness, and dramatic reduction in intelligence. The sole exception will hereinafter be designated RM-108c, the others collectively RM-113b.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>RM-108c and RM-113b were moved to the Bio Experiment Lab for detailed observation.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>400 varieties of poison were injected or force-fed to the subject. Subject's visual and auditory nerves were replaced with tissue from RM-5c and RM-60c. Balaur muscle tissue successfully transplanted to subject.</p>

          <p>Procedural Log: New procedure designed to create ideal close-quarters fighters. Selected tissues from RM-78c were transplanted into selected subjects. 30% died from various side effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Testing determined that subjects' vision and auditory senses are similar to RM-78c, but combat skills are only equal to elite soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One Centurion was completed and sent to Azoturan Fortress for battle experience testing.</p>
