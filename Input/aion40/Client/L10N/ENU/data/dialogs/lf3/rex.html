          <p>You know who has the most diverse collection of plants in all of Atreia? Rex, that's who!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are plenty of plants in the Poya Jungle, but you won't discover them sitting in some camp. I discover tens of new mushroom species every year!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Try doing that in a library! Good solid fieldwork is the essence of all discovery!</p>
