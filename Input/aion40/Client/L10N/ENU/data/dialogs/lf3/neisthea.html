          <p>Heironopolis and Vaizel's Peak are the relics of the Superus civilization that was prosperous in the Heiron region before the Cataclysm. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The civilization was clearly very developed based on other relics that we've found. It's all so fascinating.</p>
