          <p>It seems that there's no place Humans can't live. Brave people still live in this village, even though the Balaur threaten their very doorstep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lepharists are a threat as well. This place is truly besieged. Good thing we Daevas of Zephyr are here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I shouldn't say so, but if not for my efforts this village would have fallen to the Balaur or Lepharists long ago.</p>
