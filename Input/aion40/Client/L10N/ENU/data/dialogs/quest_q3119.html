          <p>There are so many undead in the Adma Stronghold, they should just call it Zombie Central.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know, maybe we should study them! Maybe we can find out something that will help us get rid of them faster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, [%username]! Collect some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q3118a]s from the Undead and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Klotho]. She ought to know who to give the blood to.</p>

          <p>This blood came from the Asmodian Undead? Hmm... We might be able to sell this to some of the scholars for a nice profit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rovilance might be all right. He has a great sense for what makes money.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad he's still a rookie, haha. We'll split the profits just between us, okay?</p>

          <p>Rovilance said Klotho would know where to sell the Asmodian Undead's blood drops. He asked you to get them and take them to Klotho, who agreed that Rovilance's plan was good and would make a tidy profit.</p>
