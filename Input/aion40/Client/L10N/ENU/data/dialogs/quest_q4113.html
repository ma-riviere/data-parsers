          <p>I'm not sure if you've heard about the recent changes with the Manastone Removers Association, but we've become unionized.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't really heard too much about why, but rumors say Pandaemonium wasn't paying female soldiers as much as males...but those are just rumors. We don't get much news out here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I have an order to fill for 30 manastones--3 bundles of 10 each. If you can find me what I need, I'll give you a tasty reward.</p>

          <p>So, I've received reports that we need bundles of HP +60, Accuracy +20, and Block +20 manastones. So that's 10 of each, for a total of 30.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it sounds like a lot, but you probably have most of them in your cube or warehouse. And the rest you can find within spitting distance, I'm sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you check your warehouse? Do you have them?</p>

          <p>Have you heard other rumors about the Manastone Removers Association? Is that why you're declining?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are a lot of distressing stories drifting around Brusthonin these days. I don't even want to speculate on some that I've heard...including Balaurean business ties.</p>

          <p>Be safe, Daeva. I'll be here if you change your mind.</p>

          <p>I heard the Manastone Removers Association has been making Kinah on the side by selling some of these manastones to dubious customers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm just a remover...a union remover now, but still just a remover.</p>
