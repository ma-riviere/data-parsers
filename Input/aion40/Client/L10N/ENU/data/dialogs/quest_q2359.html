          <p>Daeva! I need your help, if you have time. I can't speak in detail of my mission, but it's urgent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can tell you this...I'm searching for Daevas. Well, weapons, notes, their work, their findings.</p>

          <p>No, I need help uncovering, literally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's something I found recently. It's from a sword, most likely shattered in combat. These mineral deposits from the lava make it hard to see, but it has rich engravings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look here, and here. This wasn't any old weapon. This was custom made. It belonged to a Daeva.</p>

          <p>That's where you come in. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FlyingEyeD_28_An]s produce an acidic fluid that will dissolve the scaling.</p>

          <p>Perfect. Now I just extract the fluid...mix it with these other materials... and create the solvent!</p>
