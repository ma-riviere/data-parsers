          <P>Lady Lumiel, ordered the Temple of Wisdom to heal the lands of Brusthonin. And so my sisters in the Wisdom Orb Legion and I have come.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <p>We've studied the contamination in the soil and we're making great strides towards curing it. The research takes a great deal of my time, however, and I have other matters to attend as well.</p>

					<p>The Archons and Watch protect the settlers while our Legion focuses on soil research. We make great strides, but it leaves me blind to what the other groups are accomplishing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I really need are updates on how the settlers and reconstruction projects are faring. I get written status reports, of course, but what someone knows and what they'll put in a permanant record aren't always the same thing. </p>

          <p>The settlers are afraid to tell us how things are really going. All we hear are the good things, which is fine as far as it goes, but it's the setbacks we really need reported. </p>

          <p>It's my job as the de facto leader to keep the settlers safe--herding Taygas is easier, to be honest. We're doing our best, here, but it's just not safe. We can't even walk around in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_DF2A] without fear of attack.</p>

          <p>I tell you what, Daeva. A farmer without land isn't worth a bucket of Kobold dung. There, I said it. It's just so freeing to finally get it out in the open. </p>

          <p>Years of chef training gone to waste. I dreamed of opening my own cafe, or cooking for generals....Where did I end up, though? The camp cook for a bunch of settlers. It's very frustrating.</p>

          <p>Snill told you that poor food quality is slowing work, and Jarnsaxa said that food shortages would soon lead to starvation. Randet seemed surprised by your reports but promised to act on them at once.</p>
