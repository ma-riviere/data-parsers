          <p>This is indeed a proud moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Weaponsmithing is an ancient and venerated skill. In spite of my years of study, it seems you have surpassed me. There is no more for me to teach you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your diligence and effort have paid off, [%username].</p>

          <p>No, the credit belongs to you. With little else to guide you but my words, you have excelled where others have fallen short.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the time has come for you to take your rightful position amongst your peers. But it is your decision to make. Would you like to receive the title of Weaponsmithing Expert?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, this is certainly a matter worthy of my time! Without weaponsmiths such as yourself, our Daeva would be left to battle Asmodians and Balaur with little more than their courage and wits. You have obviously reached the highest level of proficiency in your craft.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hereby bestow upon you the title of Expert. Furthermore, I trust you will always remain steadfast in your efforts to arm Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I urge you now to return to Anteros, [%username], and see if he can help you further in your trade. Congratulations!</p>
