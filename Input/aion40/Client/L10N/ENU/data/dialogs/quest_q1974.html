          <p>Ha! Excellent spirit! Make Vulcanus' Noble Breastplate if you can, and bring it to me for inspection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need more than talent to make something so rare. Only intensity of spirit will allow you to succeed, but if my judgment is correct, you will have no problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you must know this--if you become a Armorsmithing Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So please think carefully before you answer.</p>
