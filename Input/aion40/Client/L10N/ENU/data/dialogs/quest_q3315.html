        <p>It's the Manduris! When you were up in the Stores last, you scared them off, which was a great temporary fix. But now they're back with a vengeance, and we need to take a more aggressive stance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't let those brutes use the Mystic Spring as their dumping grounds!</p>
