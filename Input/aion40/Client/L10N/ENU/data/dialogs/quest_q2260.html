          <p>Even though the Taygas were frightened off, we still lost a lot of construction supplies. As it stands we don't have enough material to continue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I didn't want to do this but... I need to request more materials from the Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brigade General Suthran will be furious! But, it can't be helped. We need those supplies to keep working.</p>
