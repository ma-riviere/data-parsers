          <p>I'm slowly figuring this out, [%username]. Besides Dragel, there's something called Drazma. Both cause mutations, and they're both related somehow to Drana. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I'm interpreting the report correctly, Drana just might be the source of all the rest. I need to know more--such as how are the Balaur obtaining it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The report's a bit short on detail, but the hints are quite tantalizing.</p>

          <p>I'm sure you can. I have to have some examples of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3916a]. </p>

          <p>If I can analyze the similarities between Dragel and Drana, I'll know more about how they're related.</p>
