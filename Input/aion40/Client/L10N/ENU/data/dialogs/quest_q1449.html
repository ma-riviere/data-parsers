          <p>I'd like to make an Adamantium Sword. I used to be a fine weapons crafter before I grew old.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, I don't have enough Adamantium to make a sword. To get it, I would have to venture to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_I1]. The journey would surely be the death of me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I know someone at the Mystic Spring of Laquepin who can supply it. Would you deliver this letter to him?</p>
