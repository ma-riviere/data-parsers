          <p>There's just no way we can operate like this! It's a constant struggle to ensure we have enough supplies to keep our war effort going!</p>

          <p>We've been forced to beg for supplies directly from the Elyos people! I honestly don't understand how this whole situation has come about.</p>

          <p>Oh, fantastic!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is just the kind of thing we need. Just yesterday I had a Sorcerer ask for healing remedies, and I had to send her to Sanctum. It slows our operation down, and takes a combat-ready Daeva out of the field unnecessarily!</p>

          <p>Thank you for this, [%userclass].</p>

          <p>I'll make sure it's put to good use.</p>
