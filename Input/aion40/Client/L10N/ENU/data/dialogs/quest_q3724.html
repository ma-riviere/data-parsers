          <p>As I hope you are aware, Daeva, the priority of our operation here is to cease the supply of materials and reservists to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is also another matter at hand...something only you can be made aware of. What I'm about to tell you doesn't leave this conversation.</p>

          <p>Good. A major operation we used in Reshanta...we're going to reuse it here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your priority is to eliminate...assassinate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_VID] aboard their awful ship. It won't be easy...that much I don't need to tell you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to know right now: can you handle this, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Exterminate every single Balaur commanding and secondary officer on that dredgion--exterminate with extreme prejudice. But keep to your original cover story if any other soldiers should inquire. Trust no one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As proof of mission completion for Brigade General Yulia, bring me back a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724b] from every officer you kill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In addition, [%username], you must also terminate [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanRaInspector_55_Ah] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanFiSupply_55_Ae], and bring back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724c] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724d] they should be carrying.</p>
