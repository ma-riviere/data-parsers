          <p>In order to advance your skills you must make Fasimedes' Noble Sash!</p>

          <p>If you enjoy Tailoring as much as I think you do, making Fasimedes' Noble Sash is just the thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must have a grasp of the finer skills of Tailoring to create one, but I'm sure you can do it.</p>

          <p>You can buy the Fasimedes' Noble Sash design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Proserpina]. It looks similar to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1983] design, but it's far more complex and challenging.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if you can make one of those, no one will dispute that you're an Expert.</p>
