          <p>When the Empyrean Lords ascended, they announced that they would raise an army to fight the Balaur. This army came to be called the Legion, an unstoppable fighting force of hundreds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Legion's numbers grew, and eventually it become the Sword Legion and the Shield Legion.  Over time those divided into more and more Legions as the Millennium War dragged on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually, the Empyrean Lords sanctioned a ruling body, the Nobelium, to organize and govern the creation of Legions.</p>

        <p>Famous Legions</p>
        <p> </p>
      <p>The Storm Legion: Led by Deltras, this Legion was the first to explore the Abyss, and the first to discover the Asmodians. Only a handful of men survived to tell the tale.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Nezekan's Shield Legion: One of the most decorated Legions in the Abyss War, they take their name from Lord Nezekan's shield, Izith. Like Izith, they protect us from the threats of the Balaur and the Asmodians.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Western Army Legion: This fearsome Legion is known as an unstoppable juggernaut in battle, plowing through their enemies as an axe through saplings. All their enemies tremble to hear their name.</p>

          <p>The Purpose of Legions</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While the original and central purpose of Legions was to be large-scale fighting forces, over time, some Legions have come to resemble social clubs, where Daevas meet others of like mind and purpose, and others have become little more than craftsmen's guilds. Some unofficial "Legions" even have more questionable aims such as theft or profiteering.</p>

          <p>Creating a Legion</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Legions must meet three requirements to be sanctioned by Sanctum. Firstly, all members must swear an oath that they share a common cause. Secondly, they must have an approved Legion name. Thirdly, a small processing fee must be paid to the Legion Office. After that, the Legion is officially formed and can begin recruiting new members and enjoying all other benefits of Legionhood, including their emblematic cloaks.</p>

          <p>Legion Ranks</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Legion Office classifies Legions into three ranks based on the number of Legionaries, their contributions to the war, and their monetary assets. Higher-ranked legions can purchase more supplies from Sanctum, including personal Kisks to help them do battle in the Abyss.</p>
