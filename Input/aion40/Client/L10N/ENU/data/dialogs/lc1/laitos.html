          <p>What brings you all the way out here, Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Outer Port isn't pristine like the rest of Sanctum. Nobody talks about it much, but sometimes there's trouble right here...watch your purse. Con artists and swindlers will eagerly part you from your Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans in Poeta or Verteron think Sanctum is all clean streets and serenity. Does it ever occur to them that we might have our rough spots too?</p>
