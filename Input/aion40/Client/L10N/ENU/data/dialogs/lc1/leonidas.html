          <p>At any time I could fly into a fierce battle, and die valiantly! I wouldn't regret it, not once! I could be dead within the hour! One day I shall perish, and I am ready! I spit in the eye of death!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...It's strange, really, when I think about it. Nobody's managed to kill me yet. I always charge into the fight, but I never seem to die. I suppose I'm just too good. I wish I knew if that was a blessing or a curse....</p>
