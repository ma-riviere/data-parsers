          <p>In some universe where Asmodians frolic in the sunshine and Balaur spend most of their time gardening, your ability to choose clothes might--might!--be considered almost mediocre.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We do not, as you may notice, live in that universe.</p>

          <p>My genius is at its peak. Daevas come from the farthest reaches for the privilege of having me berate them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And do you know why? Because I spend days, years, crafting a single garment, only releasing it at the pinnacle of its perfection. There is no detail too small, no expense too high, when it comes to my quest to achieve sartorial greatness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when you say, "I think I'll just take one of those" right off the rack, you make a mockery of everything I work for. You show your ineptitude in the land of fashion! You break the remains of my tiny heart!</p>
