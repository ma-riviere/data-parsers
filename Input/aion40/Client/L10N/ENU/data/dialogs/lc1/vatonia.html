          <p>Greetings, [%username]. People call me the Walking Encyclopedia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whenever they wish to know some obscure fact, they come and consult me.</p>

          <p>I first came to this library over five hundred years ago. At first, it was just to amuse myself and while away the hours. However, the more I read, the more knowledge I absorbed and the deeper my love of learning grew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I kept reading and reading. Now, half a millennia later, I have earned the unofficial title of "Walking Encyclopedia."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a misnomer, in truth. The more books I read, the more acutely I feel the gaps in my knowledge. There is still so much yet to be found out.</p>
