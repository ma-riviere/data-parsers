          <p>Greetings, Daeva. Are you looking for information about an ancient weapon? Oh, I just assumed you were. Normally that's all anyone asks me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ancient weapons and artifacts contain a lot of information if you know how to look at them. Studying a weapon can tell us much about the culture that made it.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm one of the few people more interested in learning about weapons than wielding them. If I go on too long about it you can tell me to stop. I won't be offended.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your understanding. I spend long hours at my studies, so I sometimes forget other people aren't as interested.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>I'm a little rusty at making casual conversation, unless I'm talking to a fellow researcher...then you can't get us to shut up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to worry that my devotion to my studies might make me unlikeable, but that doesn't bother me anymore. My work is important, and I enjoy it.</p>
