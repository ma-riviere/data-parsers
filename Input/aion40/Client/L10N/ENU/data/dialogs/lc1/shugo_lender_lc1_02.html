          <p>Welcome, Daeva, to home of highest quality weapons in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Notice, please. Rinurinirerk's wares are in whole new league. Other vendors still sell weapons and armor made with Balaur materials. No good for Elyos Daevas, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here you find only items of highest quality, no Balic goods. Some say rental time limit is trade-off, but Rinurinirerk can see you understand importance of best quality armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please. Let us not put price on best craftsmanship in Elysea. First, Daeva must view items and understand their value.</p>
