          <p>Do you know about the Five Seraphim Lords? Let me tell you of them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ariel is the Lightbringer, a transcendent beacon! Nezekan is the Justicar, bringer of judgment! Vaizel is the Liberator, who shatters the yoke of enslavement! Kaisinel is a Blessed Deceiver, weaver of illusions! And Yustiel is the Nurturer, sustainer and preserver of life!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We praise them, and ask them to keep us in their favor--Human and Daeva alike. Do you have a prayer to offer up?</p>

          <p>Let us pray together, then. I have faith that the Five will hear your petition, and be swift to grant it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely they who see all things, from the tiniest speck of dust to the farthest star, will see the desire that burns within you, and pay heed.</p>
