          <p>The waters are beautiful, are they not? They seem to cleanse the very soul, even as you sit and watch them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often come here to calm my mind and meditate. All my troubled thoughts and deep fears are carried away when I sit in silence here by the waters.</p>

          <p>The miracle of the constant waterfalls is a reminder of the power of the Five. They watch over us constantly even in our darkest moments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There will be dark times in your future, too, I think--times when you return from the battlefield spattered with blood and filth, with the screams of the dying ringing in your ears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of where the waters flow pure and clear. Think on the purity of Aether and find peace.</p>
