          <p>There's an old saying that you can judge a swordsman's prowess by watching him dance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Balance, rhythm, and precise control of your movements are common to both disciplines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you dance, [%username]? I think you should.</p>

          <p>Hello, [%username]. I noticed you watching me. You must appreciate what you see, hmm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No need to answer. The compliment of your gaze is enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've worked hard to master this art. I feel no shame in accepting the thanks of grateful admirers.</p>
