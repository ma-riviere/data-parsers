          <p>Hatching a pet from an egg is like having a baby. You'll pour your heart and soul into it.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>And your pet will return that energy tenfold. Some even bring you gifts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's because they love you. If you don't want a pet for the love, then you'll both be upset on bad days.</p>
