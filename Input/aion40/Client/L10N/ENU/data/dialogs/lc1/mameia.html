          <p>I've been studying the Krall for...oh, it feels like forever! I've sort of made them my life's work. They're endlessly fascinating creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you've read my books? "A Study of Krallic Religious Rituals"? Okay, how about "Basic Krallic Language"? No? Never mind. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose it is a bit of a niche field of study. I tend to forget, not everyone shares my enthusiasm.</p>

          <p>Oh, I'm glad you asked! Okay, so...you probably know this already, but the Krall are a race of Sapiens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like other Sapiens, their biological structure differs from that of Humans or Daevas. Of course, they differ greatly from animals as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's as if they have a whole branch of the biological tree to themselves. I'm still gathering data, right now. There's not much to go on, but I learn more each day!</p>
