          <p>Zumion was the first and most glorious Atreian temple. Built by the power of Aion, the shrine was grandiose and beautiful. Verdant gardens, smooth pristine walls, crystal blue waters. Zumion was most sacred ground; all of Atreia made pilgrimage to bask in Zumion's beauty and Aion's glory. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though the Balaur ruled the world, Humans worshipped Aion alone and developed their own religion and culture. The priests of Zumion were chosen for their faith and wisdom. They wielded great authority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zumion's beauty and the priests' faith gave Humans hope through centuries of oppression.</p>

          <p>The first creatures given breath by Aion, the Balaur, became the first creatures to curse Aion's dominion. The Balaur envied Aion's power over life and death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unsatified with persecuting the races of Atreia, the Balaur desired more power--Aion's power--and questioned the Tower's absolute might.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shrines devoted to Aion were anathema to them. So, the Balaur Lords set out to desecrate every temple in Atreia.</p>

          <p>One by one, the Balaur systematically demolished the shrines in Atreia, sending terrified people fleeing before them to Zumion. With all the other shrines in ashes, Meslamtaeda finally reached Zumion. Shattering its buildings was no longer enough to quench the Drakan Lord's rage and hatred of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans huddled inside the temple, beseeching Aion to intervene. Instead, they heard Meslamtaeda's dreadful voice roar a curse: "Zumion, silence! Forever!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even as the words echoed back, every quavering follower and priest turned to stone. The shrine sank into the water. What had once been the pinnacle of Aion's glory became in moments the zenith of the Balaur's jealousy.</p>

          <p>The collapse of Zumion reverberated among the remaining Humans. Horrified, they did not dare to rebuild the shrine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As time's pages turned, Zumion faded from Human memory and the Balaur vanished from Atreia. However, the Zumion Ruins still remain, silent now, under the water.</p>
