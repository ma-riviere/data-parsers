          <p>Daeva, you are addressing Fasimedes, the Governor of Sanctum.</p>

          <p>You've made your mark, but whether that mark is the stamp of bravery or stupidity remains to be seen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must assume you have something important to tell me. Something that may alter the course of this endless war. Am I correct in this assumption?</p>

          <p>Listen closely, [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every day I'm presented with reinforcement requests, logistics issues, battlefield reports, research and development updates, broadcasts from the Abyss, and portal status updates. I must regularly speak with the Five, and constantly assess and evaluate the overall war effort, balancing homeland protection with strategically relevant offensives....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My point, [%userclass], is that I have little time to spare and no time for idiots. I would appreciate not having to worry about constant interruptions from my own soldiers. I will let the offense pass this time. Do not be so presumptuous again.</p>
