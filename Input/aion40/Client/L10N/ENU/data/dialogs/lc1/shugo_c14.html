          <p>Perhaps you can tell Maorinerk why he must trade insults with customers, and not Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is just business, yes? Sometimes there are problems! Always someone is at fault, but angry words instead of fair negotiations are not acceptable.</p>

          <p>Rude Luelas comes often for spices. Maorinerk always trades fairly, but Luelas insists that this month's goods are not the same as before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Poorer quality. Poorer, he says! Terms are clear. No returns, no refunds. No need for anger, is just business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why must he call me a Sapiens? Sapiens! Of all things to say!</p>

          <p>Why? Why?! Is an insult to all Shugos!</p>

          <p>We are no Sapiens! Would Daeva trade with Krall or Dukaki? Sapiens?! Stupid, violent creatures. Not at all like Shugos.</p>

          <p>Maorinerk, has worked long and hard to serve, and this is his thanks?</p>
