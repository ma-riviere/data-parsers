          <p>I feel that you have been in contact with Eternity Fragments. Or, at the least, you know of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are sacred items, [%username]. Your collecting them would be worthwhile, for Elysea and yourself personally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For yourself personally because I am offering rewards for your Eternity Fragments. Would you like to see them?</p>

          <p>But alas.... You don't seem to have any Eternity Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know getting them may seem like wasteful effort considering the war, but I can assure you it is not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rewards we give may help you in war against the Balaur and Asmodians. Is that not worth it all on its own?</p>
