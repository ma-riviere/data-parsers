          <p>When he arrived, Lepharists! Everywhere with constructions, patrols. How is a Shugo supposed to compete with that?</p>

          <p>Business plan is already in motion. Diligent young Shugo workers are coming, supplies are ordered...all ruined now.</p>

          <p>Barosunerk has neither Kinah nor power to kick out Lepharists from his hot spring.</p>
