          <p>The brass at Eltnen Fortress are out of touch with the realities we live with every day. They've assigned us a patrol area that's far too large to cover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can just about manage to patrol the major danger spots, but there are potential problem areas, and I can't spare anyone to investigate.</p>

          <p>For one thing, the desert north of here is usually full of Morphinos, but I haven't seen one in weeks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1336_2], south of Sataloca's Tomb, is unusually quiet. I haven't seen any smoke from their chimneys in several days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>South of here at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1336_3], you can usually find Razorwing Gryphus. They're scavengers, and I'm afraid the fact that they haven't left the area for several days means there's a rich source of carcasses there to attract them.</p>

          <p>Thanks. I know it's a lot to ask.</p>

          <p>Okay, north of here you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1336_1]. [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1336_2] is toward the southern end of Sataloca's Heart, and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1336_3], where the Razorwing Gryphus are, is just south of where we're standing.</p>
