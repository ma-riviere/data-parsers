          <p>All the Daevas are fighting the Balaur in the Abyss. But we've got Balaur--full-grown, honest-to-Aion Balaur--right here in Heiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one seems to care.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur opened up an Abyss Gate at the Indratu Barracks. I doubt they'll stay there for long.</p>

          <p>I know! The Aether that flows through Elysea is supposed to be anathema to the Balaur. Somehow, they're resisting it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our forces are tied up in the Abyss. Every time I send a report about the Balaur in the Indratu Barracks, my superiors ask me, "Are you sure they aren't ordinary Drakan troopers?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you've earned a lot of respect throughout Elysea. Can you investigate the Indratu Barracks and report what you've seen firsthand?</p>

          <p>You're the Daeva who's going to deal with the Balaur at Indratu Barracks? Excellent. I've figured out how the Balaur can stay here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the Balaur Guardian Stones--they repel the Aether itself! That's why the blasted Balaur can walk freely throughout the barracks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get rid of the Balaur Guardian Stones, [%username]. The flow of Aether will weaken the Balaur...maybe kill them or force them to retreat.</p>

          <p>Piros works quickly. As soon as I sent him a report on the Balaur Guardian Stones, I knew he'd send someone to destroy them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_DragonObelisk_Q1062]s are easy to find--they're scattered all over the Nute Warrens northwest of here. The entrance looks like the mouth of a dragon. However, the place is filled with Draconutes and Nagas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, smash all the Balaur Guardian Stones in the warrens. Then, dispose of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DrakanLF3Boss_48_Al]. We don't want them to repair or replace the stones right away.</p>

          <p>Lamidros told you that the Balaur Guardian Stones were in the Nute Warrens. You destroyed the Balaur Guardian Stones and Guardian Drafala. When you returned to Brigade General Perento, he said plans were underway to destroy the Indratu Legion.</p>
