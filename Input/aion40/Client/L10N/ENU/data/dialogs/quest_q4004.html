          <p>Now we just have to figure out how to help the settlers. I will contact the Temple of Wisdom, but we should deal with the food problem ourselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our Legion's research has helped make cultivating the land a real possibility. It's time to make that part of the answer.</p>

          <p>With Lumiel's help--and yours, of course--Brusthonin will be self-sufficient once more.</p>

          <p>Exactly! Here, take these Improved Seeds. Decades of research went into these, so guard them well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find fields everywhere in the Polluted Waste. Try to plant them in [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2A_FOBJ_Q4004]s.</p>
