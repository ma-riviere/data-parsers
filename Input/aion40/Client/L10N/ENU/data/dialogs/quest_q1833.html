	<p>Here to hand in a relic, I hope.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The Balaur Treasury is supposed to be littered with them, you know. Jewels from our history, the very tools our ancestors used in all aspects of their lives.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They're not just museum pieces either. More than once we're discovered ancient secrets lost long ago. That's why I've been authorized to hand out Abyss Points to those who recover them.</p>

	<p>So you do! Interesting--just a shame it's so damaged. Did you drop this?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>We grade the relics on two criteria, condition and age. This relic is so damaged that it wouldn't have been of much value, but the few markings that I can make out seem to suggest it's a relatively recent relic.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Unfortunately for you, that means the relic is of little value to you, and your reward is in the lowest bracket.</p>

	<p>Well, look at that! The markings are in ancient Atreian!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>This piece would have been a significant find, but many of the inscriptions are illegible from the damage this piece has sustained. Shame, a terrible shame.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Still, the item's age alone elevates it above the lowest bracket of item. Please bring others like it.</p>

	<p>Stunning!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The condition of the relic is nearly flawless, and it's clearly an extremely old item. If it weren't for these few scratches you'd have uncovered a truly perfect sample.</p>

	<p>Well...well yes, I believe it may well be!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>This is an outstanding sample, [%username]. Its condition is nigh on perfect, and the markings here and here tell me the age of the relic. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you so much for bringing me your find. Our researchers will be thrilled with such a specimen, I'm sure.</p>

	<p>I'm sorry, [%username], but I cannot believe that you found this yourself. The Balaur Treasury is heavily guarded--I don't believe you would have been able to gather anything from within its walls.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>That leaves me wondering exactly where DID you recover the relic?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I can't take this, [%username]. We only accept items that were recovered directly by the Daeva who brings them to us. I'm sorry.</p>

	<p>No, no, you should hold onto that for now. I can't give you any more Abyss Points right now, but if you get stronger, or if you lose your current points somehow... well, I'll still be around.</p>

	<p>These ancient relics are each tiny portals into our history.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They were the tools, weapons and books that our ancestors used centuries ago. The Balaur attacked and plundered our resources. They nearly wiped all traces of Humanity from the face of Atreia.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>But why didn't they destroy our relics? Why did they preserve them? Perhaps the relics themselves hold the answers to our questions.</p>

	<p>I'm sorry [%username], but there's nothing here.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Did you leave the relic somewhere else? Some relics are extremely delicate, but you don't even have fragments in your cube, and I refuse to believe the item was crushed to dust in transit.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>See if you can find it and bring it to me as soon as you can. Faith and arms!</p>
