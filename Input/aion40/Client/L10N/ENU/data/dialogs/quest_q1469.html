          <p>Thank you, [%username]! I've heard that there's a door in the basement of the Kyola Temple that leads to a temple in Asmodae. That temple could very well be the Fire Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go through that door into the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1469_Zone] and look for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Denlavis], please.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he's not there...please don't give up. Anything you might find could be a clue.</p>
