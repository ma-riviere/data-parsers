          <p>Two of the others went out while you were gone.  Found a fruit. An Elim fruit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it. Elim fruit grow once a decade, sometimes once a century, and what do Embla and Utgar want to do with it? Eat it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Took a drawn blade to stop them.</p>

          <p>I don't care about how things get done, Daeva. I care that they get done. I took the path of least resistance. No one was hurt, and I have the fruit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now you need to take it back to its owner. His name's [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Magni]. Poor thing was hit by lightning a while ago, and is going to die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give him his fruit back, [%userclass]. Do the right thing.</p>

          <p>You went to Magni to return the Fruit to him. However, he told you the fruit meant nothing to him, and was willing to let you keep it.</p>
