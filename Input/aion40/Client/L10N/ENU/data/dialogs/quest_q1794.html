          <p>We have taken control of the Miren Fortress--for now. The Asmodians won't give it up without a fight, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In particular, the Red Hasia Legion is gathering around the bind point on Drakenwreck. They've been quiet lately, but that just unsettles me all the more.</p>

          <p>Of course they're planning something! They're always planning something!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The trouble is that our numbers are already stretched thin--we can't spare the men to find out what those roaches are planning. Perhaps you might help us?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rossjof], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grid], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lofn], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lifprasir], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Magnair], you might find an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1794a] on them. Bring that back here, and maybe we can determine what they're up to.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. If we can get hold of that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1794a], we can learn what they're plotting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll be able to shut them down before they get started.</p>

          <p>If, Ariel forbid, things do not go your way, retreat immediately. Those plans aren't worth losing one of our best Daevas.</p>
