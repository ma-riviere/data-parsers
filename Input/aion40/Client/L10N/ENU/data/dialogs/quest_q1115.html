          <p>Ah, [%username]. I was hoping you might help me with something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you see the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA29] standing by me? His name is Noah, and I think he wants help with something, though for the life of me I don't know what it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What makes matters worse is that Elim hardly ever speak to Humans, so for Noah to contact me like this--there must be something seriously amiss.</p>

          <p>If you plan on heading to Lake Cliona anytime soon, please speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_LA07]. She has conversed with the Elim before and may be able to understand what Noah is asking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find her by [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA03]. I'm sure she'll be willing to help.</p>

          <p>You were right to come to me with this. Problems in the Daminu Forest often have implications for the rest of Poeta, so this is certainly something I should look into.</p>
          <p> </p>
