          <p>Aye, it was a dreadful slaughter. They slew our Guardian General, and we withdrew in shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better to live to retake the fortress than die in futile battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our latest reports show that the Asmodians may have taken the fortress back from the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Whoever has it is irrelevant. It should be ours. Will you help us retake Siel's Western Fortress?</p>

          <p>The plan is thus: eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_title_1746] of fighters and archers, and bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1746a]s to me.</p>
