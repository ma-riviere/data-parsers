          <p>A top Pandaemonium general has hired us to steal combat orders from Agent Greenlake, an Elyos strategist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: Intelligence confirms that she is involved in the planning of a large-scale assault on Gelkmaros. She has written orders due to be delivered to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is our duty to find Agent Greenlake and take the orders from her before she can send them to her masters. They may also give insight into future Elyos plans.</p>
