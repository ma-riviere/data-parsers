          <p>Argh! They've done it again! I can't sell my goods if half of them are stolen by the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Condor_DR_58_An]s, can I?</p>

          <p>Argh! They make me so angry! Please, [%username], for the love of Siel, do something about them? They're based near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1] cliffs--when they're not over here thieving my goods, that is.</p>
