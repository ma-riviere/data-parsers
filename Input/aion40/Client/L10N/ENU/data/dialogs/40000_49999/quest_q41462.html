          <p>I have something deeply Reian to assign you, [%username]. I would feel uncomfortable giving you this task, but you're just one step away from joining Siel's Spear....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are a great many undead Reians wandering through Tiamaranta. We do not know why they stalk our lands, but we need them dealt with. Now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The elders have allowed me to assign you this as part of your Koligran, and require you to head to Tiamaranta and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_YunFi_Ghost_59_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_YunWi_Ghost_59_An]s there. Complete the task, and you'll earn yourself a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_02].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now. The abominations desecrate our way of life with every blasphemous step.</p>
