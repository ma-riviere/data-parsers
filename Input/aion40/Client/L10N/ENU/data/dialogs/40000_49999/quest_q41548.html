          <p>I've lived here for many years, researching Gurriki social patterns. It's rewarding stuff, for the most part.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But lately the population has boomed, and I've noticed a disturbing trend. As the swamp and grotto become more crowded, some Gurriki are becoming violent where they used to be peaceful and endearing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's mostly the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuFi_57_Ae]s and the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuAs_57_Ae]s. They actually attack me when I'm out in the field! [%username], I hate to do it, but could you cull their numbers a little, for all of our sakes?</p>

          <p>Good... I guess. After so many years among them, I always feel awful when the Gurriki die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now at least I can conduct my research without getting clobbered.</p>
