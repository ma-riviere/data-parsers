          <p>It's time for your next test. I hope you're ready. Each member of the Siel's Spear Legion must create an item known as a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452a_1] before they are permitted entry to the unit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These statues are then kept in our most sacred temple and used in our daily prayers, thereby safeguarding its creator as they serve the legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, obviously these statues are not easy to craft, and require a great deal of time and patience. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Seles] will tell you more, if you accept the challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and one more thing. The temple requires the statue be sent alongside another [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_01].</p>

          <p>We have a term for outsiders who dream of living Reian lives such as yourself, you know. We call you "banjani", which roughly translates to "he who reaches without fingers to grasp." </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I have heard of your efforts so far, and I will not stand in way of your efforts, no matter how futile they may be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun has already contacted me regarding your application. You are to craft a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452a_1], correct?</p>

        <html>
        <body>
          <p>Of course you don't! You have not been steeped in our ways. You are a Sparkle hoping to be accepted as a Brax. Still, I am required to give you the same information I give other applicants, so listen carefully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are seven items required: a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_WS], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_AS], a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_TA], an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_HA], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_AL], some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_CO], and an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452B_ME]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each of these items must be crafted themselves, and each require mastery in a specific field of crafting. You are not Reian, so you won't be able to craft them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the test is not concerned with your crafting skills, but your patience and commitment. You may purchase the items required if able. Once you have them all, then you will need to combine them into the statue.</p>

          <p>Back so soon, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you haven't already created your [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41452a_1]. The lesson, by the way, is that many fine things can work together to create something even finer. The Asmodian principle isn't so different, as far as I understand it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, how can I help you?</p>

          <p>This... this is superb. Did you create this? Truly? It's flawless, as good as the finest statue I've received. Honestly, I am at a loss for words. I'll... I'll make sure this is sent to our temple right away.</p>
