          <p>When the Heart of Petrification filled with Tiamat's power, it spilled over into this land, turning this beautiful temple to stone and petrifying the Reians within.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We fear that their souls linger still, trapped within unforgiving stone by the Dragon Lord's hateful power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Materia] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T4_S2]. She can tell you more.</p>

          <p>I know it's important to focus on the present situation in Tiamaranta, but the thought of an eternity trapped in stone....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This Aether Marble is tuned to Reian aetheric vibrations. If you use it on the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_CrystalYun] members, it should crack the stone and release their souls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion knows what kind of state those souls are in by now, but I pray that Lady Siel's mercy will guide them peacefully into the aether.</p>

          <p>Nico sent you to find Materia so you could help her release some Reian's souls trapped by Tiamat's Power of Petrification.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Materia gave you an Aether Marble that could break down the stone trapping the souls, and you freed the trapped Reian spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The souls of the freed Reians were grateful to you, as was Materia, who was happy to have honored her ancestors.</p>
