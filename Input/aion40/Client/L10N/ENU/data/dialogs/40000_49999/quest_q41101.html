          <p>When you're in the Sandstorm Legion, the word "deadline" takes on a more literal meaning than usual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For instance, we must kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Sheluk_Worm_Nmd_57_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_IronGolem_Nmd_57_An], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Daru_DR_Nmd_57_n] in northern Sarpan to clear the way for a major offensive. But the influx of refugees had seriously interfered with Sandstorm efficiency.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can kill just one of them, then we'll have the time to take out the rest before the deadline. [%username], peace in Sarpan depends on this.</p>

          <p>Venomous Geruk, Kugen the Ravager, and Careful Peruru are quite powerful. Having to deal with all of them in addition to the offensive's goals would be too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll move out against the other two once we know that you've dealt with the third.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I'll send word right away!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My higher-ups won't tell me why our schedule is so tight, but this must be important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm sure your contribution will be noticed. Until then, take this on behalf of the rest of the Sandstorm Legion.</p>
