          <p>The term "Sandstorm Targets" refers to the creatures that pose the greatest threat to Sarpan--the Sandstorm Legion's most wanted list, if you will. We pursue them with extreme predjudice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ordinary monsters are nothing compared to these fiends. But they're wily, and despite our best resources, they're difficult to find.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we recruit special agents. Without the help of capable Daevas like you, [%username], the Sandstorm Targets will be on the loose forever. Find one of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41114a] and kill it.</p>

          <p>You know, in the wild, Qooqoos have mass migrations every 14 years. We're talking thousands at a time. Such a wave of Qooqoos is a sight to behold... and more than a little humbling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're in one piece, I see. I'm glad you came back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Were you able to find your target? It couldn't have been easy.</p>

          <p>It's quite amazing. You've done what we continually fail to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You would make a fine addition to the Sandstorm Legion, [%username]. Thank you for your efforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this reward. A bit of gratitude from all the Legion. I hope to see you again.</p>
