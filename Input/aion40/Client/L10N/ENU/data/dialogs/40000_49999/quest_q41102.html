          <p>Peace in Sarpan is paramount, [%userclass]. It's attainable but not without sacrifice and hard work. That's where the Sandstorm comes in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got targets in the area. Not only are they messing with Reian supply lines, but they're also cutting a swath through the rest of the creatures in the forest--really messing up the ecosystem. I need you to take one of them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_Octaside_leaf_Nmd_58_An] carries a lethal venom, so watch out. And don't let the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_ElementalLightF_Nmd_58_An]'s appearance fool you--it's not delicate, not at all.</p>

          <p>Our people have struggled and suffered to get what little we have, and we deserve a little security.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You probably wouldn't believe it, but things are better now than ever before. A lot of that is due to Kahrun's leadership, I'll admit, but I think it's fair for the Sandstorm to take some of the credit as well.</p>
