          <p>Take this, [%username]. It's a Projection Crystal made from [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41574a]. It'll let you to communicate with the soul connected to the Mamut Skull. But the soul may not be right near the Skull--you may have to search around abit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The connection seems to be strongest near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_C2_S4]. Go there, and find out what you can about the Mamut. Go, go! I'm dying with curiosity. Ha!</p>

          <p>I don't think I can focus on my work until you come back, [%username]. </p>

          <p>Hello? Is someone there? Finally! Someone to talk to.</p>

          <p>I've been trapped here for so very long. But I think my salvation is long past, now. </p>

          <p>When Tiamat attacked Siel's Temple, I became separated from my fellow Reians. All I could do was watch as my friends and the temple were petrified.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Tiamat flew near, I used magic to leave my physical body and enter the Mamut's. It was the only way I could survive to bring the fight back to Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the body was petrified, and there was nowhere else for me to go. I tried and tried to revert to my own form but with no luck. I died in a Mamut's body. The Skull must have been moved over time, but this is where it dies and this is where I've been trapped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so glad to see a new generation here to defeat Tiamat. I can now embrace the flow of Aether without regret. </p>

          <p>Wow. So that's the story, is it? The soul of an ancestor, trapped while trying to escape Tiamat's curse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard to accept that this tragedy of ancient times continues to have such influence on us. All the more reason to diligently develop new weapons. I'll make sure to create the sword that helps my fellows defeat Tiamat!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is the way to honor our fallen. Enemies take heed! Ha!</p>

          <p>Shumaron asked you to use the Projection Crystal to communicate with the soul tied to the Mamut Skull.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found the Reian soul, Viter, trapped near the Ativas Cave. He had gone inside the Mamut's body to escape Tiamat's curse at the destruction of Siel's Temple, but the Mamut was petrified and Viter became trapped where the Mamut died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After hearing the story, a lamenting Shumaron decided to focus more on making the weapons that will defeat Tiamat. </p>
