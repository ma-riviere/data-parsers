          <p>The Siel's Temple Ruins are far more than a legacy of the past. Buried deep underneath these wonderful remnants of time, precious relics lie in wait.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are quite likely powerful relics from Empyrean Lady Siel herself. Just waiting for us. This is what will help us defeat Tiamat once and for all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hesitate to ask--and risk destroying the archaeological integrity of the site--but could you look around for [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_CrystalBox]s and retrieve the relics from them? PLEASE, try not to break anything, [%userrace]!</p>

          <p>We've found some amazing artifacts: mostly personal and household items. Nothing useful for the war effort, but we're gathering so much historical data.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you had any luck, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Well... this one's actually just a rock. Nice try, though. Nice try. Can't expect to find everything your first time out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These others appear to be more of the same common items we've been finding. Nothing amazing, I'm afraid. But they will definately add to our historcal understanding of the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lady Siel's secrets are here somewhere. We just have to keep digging.</p>

          <p>Taladin oversees the archaeological excavation of the Siel's Temple Ruins, hoping to find powerful relics from Empyrean Lady Siel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You brought him a collection of Ancient Relics. He was happy for the help but sad that none were from Empyrean Lady Siel.</p>
