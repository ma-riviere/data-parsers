          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recent efforts have rapidly depleted our stock of [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45048a], which is a crucial component in the manufacture of several essential substances, including healing potions and serums.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Wardens are hereby tasked with collecting this substance. All [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45048a] gathered should be brought to either [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amphibia] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mollusca].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45048a] is an important ingredient in a number of potions. If gathered fresh and distilled promptly, it can create some of the most potent healing serums around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately there's plenty to be found in Gelkmaros. Have you gathered any for me?</p>

          <p>Thank you for bringing this so quickly, [%username]. As I said, this herb can only be used to create healing potions and serums when it is distilled right after gathering. If it is left to dry too long, it becomes a deadly toxin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, take this token as a sign of the Field Wardens' thanks.</p>
