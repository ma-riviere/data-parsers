          <p>This land has few precious resources. We constantly compete for them with the Balaur and the local fauna.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the desert in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1]. It was once a lush forest before the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_SalivadoRed_56_An] population exploded ate all the vegetation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've gotten reports that they seem to be on the move. We can't afford to let them turn more potential farmland into desert. I want you to cull the Bristlewhisker Hornskulls before they start settling in refugee regions. Those poor souls have enough to worry about.</p>

          <p>Some Daevas make the mistake of dismissing anything that's not a Drakan or Sapien as a minor threat, not worth dealing with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you have more experience and wisdom than that, don't you? You know a Hornskull can be just as destructive as a Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of Hornskulls...</p>

          <p>Good, good. Hopefully we don't have to worry about them stripping the land bare again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every last resource we can wrest out of Sarpan will not only support those of us who live here, but those who move on to Tiamaranta proper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As such, I can only give you a small portion of what I would like. But I hope it shows the appreciation we all feel.</p>

          <p>Varzeni told you that Bristlewhisker Hornskulls had already stripped an entire region of vegetation, and were threatening to spread.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To stop this from happening, you reduced their numbers. You returned to Varzeni's genuine gratitude.</p>
