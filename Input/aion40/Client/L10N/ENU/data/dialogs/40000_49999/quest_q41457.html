          <p>A Koligran challenge has been set, if you are ready to fight for your right to be counted amongst our finest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the Balaur. Battle [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41266all_0] until your weapons have been dulled from use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But... be careful. You know the Balaur well, but they have learnt new tricks recently and are more aggressive than usual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now. You will not be back soon.</p>

          <p>Excellent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your reputation soars with each kill, [%username]. This Dedication Curio is more than warranted. At this rate, you'll join Siel's Spear within the month. As I said, excellent work.</p>
