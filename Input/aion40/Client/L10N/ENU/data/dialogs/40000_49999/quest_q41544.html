          <p>Now all that remains is one crucial ingredient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The final component is a lock of a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41544a]. In my vision, it was long, fine, and pale.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It looked exactly like one of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ioran]'s fair locks. But she thinks I am a fool.... Friend, will you speak to her on my behalf?</p>

          <p>Davikik gets these strange obsessions. He came down with the swamp fever a few months ago, and he's been acting kind of bizarre ever since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know if it's good for you to indulge him, [%username]... but I'll participate if you think it'll stop him hopping up here to beg me for Reian trousers and diction lessons every other day.</p>
