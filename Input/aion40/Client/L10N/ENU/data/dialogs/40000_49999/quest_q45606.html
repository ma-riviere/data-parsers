		<p>I have to admit, sometimes I lament being a quartermaster. I miss the scent of battle, the crunch of bone under boot, the scream of an Elyos falling to their death. There's nothing more invigorating, know what I mean [%username]?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Still, I have an important job here, ensuring the war effort continues to move forward, and keeping our soldiers supplied.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Well then, have some Crusader Tokens to trade in, [%username]?</p>

		<p>For seven tokens I can't offer much, [%username]. The idiots that package these supplies just denote the grade of the supplies contained in the crates, and seven Crusader Tokens will get you the worst of the bunch. </p>

		<p>Now, a Daeva of your stature should be able to slay far more Elyos and collect 15 or even 30 marks. </p>

		<p>I won't lie, there are a few half-claws in the Blood Crusaders, but with you on the battlefield, those Elyos weaklings will have nowhere to run!</p>

		<p>You're quite the jokester, [%username]! It's funny that you clearly don't have that many marks in your cube, and yet you still tried to pass it off like you did! </p>

		<p>Let's both have a laugh, because I'm sure you know that you would have lost a limb if this were not a joke. Aha. Ahaha. Aha. Ha. There.</p>

		<p>Remember to check your cube before you come waltzing over now--your limbs depend on it!</p>
