          <p>A prominent legion has hired us to destroy Necromancer Duchai.</p>

          <p> 2. Location: Reports have tracked him to the Dragonrest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: He has filled the Abyss with his undead Drakan army. His soldiers fall, only to rise again at once. This must end, or the war will turn against us.</p>

          <p>Daeva! I read the report! This Necromancer Duchai makes me shiver all over, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Please tell me you destroyed him! Thinking about him makes me mad and scared at the same time, nyerk!</p>
