          <p>Ah, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41270A_pagati] is done! Isn't that aroma wonderful? [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kinotia] will love it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want desperately to be the one to give her the soup and tell her the good news.... But I've just been summoned to fight in a major offensive. So many lives hinge on its success, but I can't bear to keep Kinotia waiting even a moment longer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you please deliver the soup, and the news, to her in my stead? Tell her I will join her as soon as I can.</p>
