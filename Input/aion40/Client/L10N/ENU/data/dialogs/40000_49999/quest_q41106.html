          <p>[%userclass], I just received reports detailing four new Sandstorm Targets. It's the blasted Sapiens again, but this time it's not just talons and trotters sticking out into Reian land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This report claims that four Sapiens were caught in some kind of meeting. These weren't just fledglings and piglets, either, but high-level tribal functionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think they may be planning something, [%userclass]--planning together, and that's unprecedented. The Urugugu are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Owllau_As_57_Nmd_Ae] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Owllau_Pr_57_Nmd_Ae], and the Humnaz are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_CalydonAs_57_Nmd_Ae] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_CalydonWi_57_Nmd_Ae]. I want you to take a team after one of those four as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Lutau the Slayer and Prophet Huruhuru, both Urugugu tribal functionaries, were seen meeting with Shadowstrike Gubacha and Dumuch Faithhealer, two elite Humnaz warriors. Sandstorm Soldier Eyan thinks that the four might be planning some kind of Sapien alliance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An alliance between the Urugugu and Humnaz would severely upset the balance of peace in Sarpan, so you eliminated one of the four targets to prevent the plan from progressing.</p>
