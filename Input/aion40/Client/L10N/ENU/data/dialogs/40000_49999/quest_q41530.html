          <p>My superiors and I are in agreement: we must stop the Dragonbound now, before they become a factor in our campaign against Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have determined their leader is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Fanatic_Named_59_An]. Defeat him, and their morale should crumble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41530a]. Use it to turn his personal guard to Ribbits, making them easy to defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then slay Krata himself. I trust you are up to this task? We cannot afford to fail.</p>

          <p>Wonderful! With Reclusive Krata gone, his remaining lackeys will be in disarray.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have already sent several Legions into the area. They should be able to mop up the rest with little problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've done Atreia a great service. Keep up the good work.</p>

          <p>Sirio wanted to eliminate the Dragonbound before they became a real threat. He charged you with killing their head, Reclusive Krata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Using a Transformation Stone, you turned Krata's personal guard into easy-to-slay Ribbits, then slew the leader himself. Sirio was grateful for your aid.</p>
