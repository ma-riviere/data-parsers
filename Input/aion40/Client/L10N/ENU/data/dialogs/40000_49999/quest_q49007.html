        	<p>What? Elyos infiltrating Brusthonin? There's no rift there!</p>

        	<p>Is it possible that they've developed Dimensional Vortex technology as well?</p>

        	<p>The incursion doesn't matter though, if you've stopped it. Give me your report.</p>

        <p>That was fortunate timing then. With their supplies and reinforcements cut off, it will be easier for us to deal with the remaining Ellies.</p>
        <p> </p>
      	<p>I'm concerned though, that we didn't realize the Elyos had landed in Brusthonin. Reconniassance shows they made their beachhead to the South.</p>

      	<p>I think we got lucky with this one. Thank you, [%username].</p>
