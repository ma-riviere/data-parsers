          <p>Have you seen the tortured souls wandering near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_02], [%username]? I just can't... I just can't describe how horrible it is there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reian souls wandering aimlessly, twisted beyond recognition by Tiamat's energies. Such sacrilege is hard to top in a Reian's eyes. The dead deserve more respect than that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, please go there and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Yun_undead_Fi_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Yun_undead_Wi_57_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are simple puppets being pulled by Balaur hands. They will not feel pain, and their souls will thank you for eternity.</p>
