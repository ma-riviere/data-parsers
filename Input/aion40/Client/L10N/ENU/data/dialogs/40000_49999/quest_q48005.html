          <p>So many come to this city every day. It's fascinating to watch. You never know who you will meet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I try to be as friendly to everyone as possible. I am one of the first representatives of Pandaemonium they see, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, as I told you before, some take advantage of that and treat me like a messenger.</p>

          <p>The reason I mentioned this is that I was given a message to give you. But they actually paid me, so I was happy to take it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see, where is it...? Oh, yes. It's from Charlirunerk's Daemons. They're a sort of mercenary organization, I understand.</p>
