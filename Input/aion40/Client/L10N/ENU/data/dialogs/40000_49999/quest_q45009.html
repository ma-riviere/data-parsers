          <p>Trusted Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hours ago we discovered that an unknown group had distributed suspicious substances across Asmodae, with the Beluslan area being one of the key loci.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Early research indicates that the substances can disturb Aetheric Field and flight devices, though they resemble ordinary stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Extreme urgency is needed in removing these substances, lest the situation in Asmodae grow even more chaotic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No Warden should lay idle--all must take initiative to disable [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45009]s and bring evidence of disposal to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007] with all due haste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not delay. Remember that every Asmodian is your ward.</p>

          <p>Ah. Thank you, Warden. This appears to be consistent with the other objects we've discovered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've managed to stave off a potential tragedy today, but who knows when this might happen again? We simply must uncover the subversive group who did this! Perhaps Pandaemonium will help us broaden our surveillance efforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, take this token for your efforts, and let me dispose of that letter for you.</p>
