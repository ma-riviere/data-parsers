          <p>It seems that the Balaur aren't the only ones taking advantage of the chaos of late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_Shadowstalker_Leaf_56_An]s, which live south of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1], have been attacking refugees and patrols. They are so named because some believe they are taking revenge for plants cut down by settlers and harvested by farmers in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, they're a menace that should be dealt with, if only so that they don't distract us from more important matters. Can you take care of it?</p>

          <p>Some refugees that recently arrived were talking about a "brave [%userrace] Daeva" battling [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_Shadowstalker_Leaf_56_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Some details, like whether there was more than one Daeva, varied, but I assume you were involved?</p>

          <p>I thought so. That means one less thorn in our side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better to take care of such problems now than risk them becoming stronger, or popping up while we're battling the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, other refugees in the area can rest easier, thanks to your efforts.</p>
