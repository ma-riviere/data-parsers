          <p>The Forest Essence is actually the energy of Tideheart. Bring it back to gain your reward.</p>

          <p>I overheard some Daevas talking about the Forest Essence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They said that Tideheart has been living there so long, it has absorbed many years of magical energy!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They seemed very excited about studying it. Now I am curious! Did you bring it for me to see?</p>

          <p>I know the Spiritfall Forest is big, but think about poor client! Do not let stupid forest defeat strong Daemon!</p>

          <p>Besides, you cannot get Token if you do not complete job! That is basic rule of Charlirunerk's Daemons!</p>

          <p>Ooooh, it is very pretty! Too bad it will be used for research; it would make very pretty necklace!</p>

          <p>I heard what client said they would do with it, but I did not understand, nyerk. Hopefully it will be good!</p>
