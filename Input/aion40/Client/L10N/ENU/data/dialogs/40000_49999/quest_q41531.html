          <p>This forbidding place teems with life. Fascinatingly, it seems that the Mudthorns and Petrahulks are an invasive species.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before Tiamat's power provoked Mount Wrath into eruption, this was a mountain plain full of wooly Daru. Green Mountain Airon lived along the streams, but that species seems to have gone extinct now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Mudthorn_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Cyclops_58_An]s that took their place cause us endless grief.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>It would be a great help if you cleared some of them out. The Pyroclasts are very effective against them--though careful not to get caught in the blast.</p>

          <p>Those Mudthorns are quite aggressive.</p>

          <p>One chased me halfway down the volcano the other day, straight into a stand of Pyroclasts.</p>

          <p>Excellent, [%username].</p>

          <p>It's hard to concentrate on calibrating a seismonitor when you're constantly watching over your shoulder.</p>

          <p>You've earned my thanks for certain, as well as this reward.</p>

          <p>Viaus noted that Flame Mudthorns and Volcanic Petrahulks, both species new to the Fields of Fire, were causing the research expedition trouble.</p>
