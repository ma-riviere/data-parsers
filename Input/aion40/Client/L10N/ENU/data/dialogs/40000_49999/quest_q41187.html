          <p>I was hoping you'd pass by, Daeva! I was just thinking, "Gee, it'd be great if a Daeva came by just when I could use some help!" And here you are! Isn't that great?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun] is just fascinated by the [%userrace] use of Medals as marks of valor. He's given me the go-ahead to make special offers to valorous Daevas who've earned Platinum Medals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's the deal, Daeva. If you give me four Platinum Medals, I'll exchange them for a Mithril Medal. A great bargain, hey?</p>

          <p>Kahrun has really been making an effort to reach out to both Elyos and Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We want both races to feel at home here, right at home!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what do you say? Want to trade those four Platinum Medals for a Mithril Medal?</p>
