          <p>Danitur has finally gone too far! He was one of our kin, once. A good soldier, too. Full of flair and a smart planner. His tactics were always unorthodox, but usually successful. Then one day he failed. His men were wiped out. He hid himself away for months, and all the while, we had already offered him forgiveness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually he emerged, but something was different in him. He began preaching about Atreia's true masters, and how he was ready to deliver us all to them. Most of us thought him crazy. Most, but not all. He left with many of our kin, and I believe you've just found them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Yun_Named_59_An] wants to abandon the Reian cause, then so be it. But the others could still be saved. You must go, [%username]. Leave for their village and find [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S6]. Knock on the summoning sculpture there, and my men will appear to apprehend the others while you kill Danitur. Once you're done, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aesty]. Understood?</p>

          <p>Good. The others will be rounded up and given a chance to redeem themselves. Danitur though, he deserved death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I do believe I owe you this. Congratulations, [%username]. Yours was a job well done.</p>

          <p>Winbrey spoke to you about the Reian Traitors, and about how they'd been misled by Danitur. You were asked to return to the traitor's village, kill Danitur, and allow the Reian guards to arrest those who had so blindly followed him.</p>
