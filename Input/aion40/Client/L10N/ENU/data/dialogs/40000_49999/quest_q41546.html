          <p>What? Well, of course he didn't transform into a Daeva! He's Gurriki! I've known him for years!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is why I told you not to indulge him! Oh, it's my fault too, for playing along... We have to do something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this necklace to him. Tell him that if he wears it for, say, ten years, it will change him back to his true form. It's a lie, of course, but Gurriki have terrible long-term memories. He'll forget what the necklace is for in a few months.</p>

          <p>Davikik's dram did not transform him into a Daeva, sending him into deep despair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You paid Ioran a visit, who felt guilty for participating in Davikik's delusion. She handed you a necklace and told you to bring it to Davikik, telling him it would transform him back to human after ten years. Gurriki have terrible memories, meaning it was likely that Davikik would forget the incident long before then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You brought Davikik the necklace, who instantly cheered up.</p>
