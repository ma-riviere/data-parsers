          <p>Orph always carries that thing around with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He used to tell people his mother dropped it the day Balaur kidnapped her... and that one day he'd get to Tiamaranta to find her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as he heard about this expedition, he ran to Kahrun to volunteer. But he just wasn't strong enough to make the Expeditionary or Zayedan forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he's come on his own... it's dangerous out there, all by himself! Please. Go back to the Avad Village and find [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41580]. </p>

          <p>Did you find Orph?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His missing mother was all he ever talked about, so we called him "Orph" for "orphan."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's eyes, I hope he's all right.</p>

          <p>How awful. I never thought he'd actually find his mother anywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to reunite only to learn she'd been Dragonbound... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Orph must have known that the Dragonbound lose all their memories, yet still he tried to fight for her.</p>

          <p>Porin thought Orph must have secretly come to Tiamaranta to find his mother, who was kidnapped by the Balaur when Orph was only a little one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to the Avad Village to search for Orph but ended up finding his lifeless body.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took Orph's Diary to Porin who recounted the tragic incident.</p>
