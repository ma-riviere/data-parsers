          <p>[%username], I need your help with something. This could be a grim task, my friend, but from what I've heard, you've had your fair share of grim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was scouting the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_10] when I saw an old backpack on a cliff edge. I would've retrieved it myself, but sands were shifting fast, and I was forced back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, I think I know who the bag belongs to, and it was heavily blood stained. I've been reassigned here now, but I can't leave this story untold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, you must find the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41211A] and take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Linacroft]. Just... be gentle.</p>

          <p>Please, be quick. I have my hands full and need to get my tools stored before this sandstorm winds up.</p>

          <p>Ganofus said he found an Explorer's Backpack while out scouting, but couldn't identify whose it was. So you went to the Jotari Sanctuary Ruins and found it on a cliff overlooking the Debarim Petralith Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took the backpack to the Jotun Lead Researcher, Luanna, and she was overwhelmed with shock, explaining that it belonged to her father.</p>
