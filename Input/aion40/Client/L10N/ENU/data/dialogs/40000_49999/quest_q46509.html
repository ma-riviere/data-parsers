          <p>We have been hired by an anonymous legion to track down Dragonbound magic-user Diama Blacktome.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: She is a former member of our client legion who took an ancient and powerful staff with her when she disappeared upon various windstreams. We must return this staff to our client.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rewards to Daemons are contingent on bringing back the staff undamaged.</p>

          <p>Wonder why staff is so valuable? What can you do with it? Just wave it, and poof, you get lots of fish? Mmm, fish!</p>

          <p>Oh, well. Does not matter what I would do with it. Client wants it, that is that.</p>

          <p>Defeat Diama Blacktome and get the staff back! Bad for Daemon reputation to let Dragonbound traitor run around!</p>

          <p>No! Cannot betray client! Must resist!</p>
