          <p>Field Warden enrollee:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Information has been received regarding the widespread distribution of a dangerous substance in key areas of Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No specific details are available, but it is believed that the objects--which can disrupt the flow of Aether--look like mundane items, possibly mineral.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All effort should be given to recovering these substances, else they interfere with our advance to Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Loyal Wardens will immediately seek out and disable [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45023]s, bringing all remnants to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021] so as to provide proof.</p>

          <p>I would never have thought someone might brazenly distribute dangerous substances around Balaurea.... Who could do such a thing? I don't think the Elyos bold enough. They must be loyal to the Balaur. Yes, that must be it....</p>

          <p>If you see these Discordian Fragments around, [%username], please destroy them immediately. We must protect Asmodae!</p>

          <p>Well walk me to the Edge and push me over, [%username]! You do quick work. Pandaemonium is deeply concerned about this rise in terroristic activity, and will no doubt continue to provide us the necessary resources to battle this plague.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your continued noble efforts. Allow me to dispose of that letter, and give you your due reward.</p>
