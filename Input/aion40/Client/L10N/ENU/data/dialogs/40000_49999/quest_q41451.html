          <p>Before we start on your second test, I must take a moment to talk to you about Lady Siel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Reians view Lady Siel as the most virtuous, the most pure. She had the courage to end her life, and use her life force to hold our shattered planet together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The others, as powerful and as convincing as they are, cannot compare, not even Lord Israphel. Think about it, [%username]. Every life that has been created since the Cataclysm owes its very existence to the benevolence of Lady Siel. Yours included.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We recognize her acts through regular tributes, and wish for you to be included in our next ceremony. Bring some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41451all_1] and another [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_01] if you accept our offer. And hurry; the others will not wait for you.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. I was waiting for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you bring the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41451all_1] I asked for? And a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_01]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're almost ready to present our tribute. Your items will make a fitting centerpiece.</p>

          <p>They're... they're beautiful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So much was lost that day. But through loss came life, hope, and existence. Though we cannot ever hope to warrant Lady Siel's sacrifice, we can at least recognize it through small acts like these.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The members of Siel's Spear Legion live their entire lives in tribute of the good lady, you know. Though you are not a member, if you ever hope to be accepted into their fold, these are all things that you must know and accept.</p>

          <p>Kahrun told you that each Reian had a duty to pay respect to Lady Siel, something which you would have to partake in if you hoped to become a member of Siel's Spear Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You agreed to help pay tribute, and traveled inside the Aetheric Field to gather the energies of the four seasons. Kahrun accepted your offering on your return, and told you a little more regarding the Spear Legion.</p>
