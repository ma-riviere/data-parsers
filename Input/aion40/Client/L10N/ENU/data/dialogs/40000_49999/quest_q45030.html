          <p>The "Balaurea Aetheric Field Observatory Plan" continues to unfold, but to truly make progress we must continue to ensure the cooperation of Archons at each key fortress.</p>

          <p>Today, we need to contact an ally named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kirhua] at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A]. Infiltrate Inggison and then take his message to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
