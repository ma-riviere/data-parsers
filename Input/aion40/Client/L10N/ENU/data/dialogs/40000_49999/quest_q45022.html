          <p>Respected Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ultimately, we all know that Empyrean Lord Marchutan's advance to Gelkmaros will lead to triumph.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aetheric levels in the atmosphere will, however, prove to be crucial in determining the speed with which we will achieve victory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Loyal allies in the Pandaemonium Research Center have provided Aetheric Field Scanners, which we have we installed in key areas of Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Wardens are advised to recover Scan Results from an [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45022] and bring them to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blood for blood, Warden.</p>

          <p>Our advance to Balaurea has been greatly bolstered by the work of the Pandaemonium Research Center. We and the research center are working more closely than ever before, in new and...unexpected ways. To our benefit!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which reminds me...did you bring me anything...special?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We really do need the Scan Results from an Aetheric Field Scanner here in Gelkmaros. Please, don't return until the job is done. The task is yours!</p>

          <p>Yes. Thank you, Warden. I'll take that off your hands now, as well as your letter. I'll see that it's properly disposed of. Balaurea surely won't fall into our hands overnight, but these...results will aid us in determining when the tide might turn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please take this token--you've earned it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You found a Scanner and brought the Scan Results to a Gelkmaros Field Agent, who rewarded you for your time.</p>
