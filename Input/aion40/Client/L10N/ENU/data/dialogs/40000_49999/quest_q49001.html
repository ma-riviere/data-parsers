          <p>Oh, [%username]. The attack isn't going as well as we hoped. Somehow the Elyos learned of our plans, and now we're in a real fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have another mission for you.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q49001]s are blocking the way to Jamanok Inn. Eliminating them will help our reinforcements join with the main force.</p>
