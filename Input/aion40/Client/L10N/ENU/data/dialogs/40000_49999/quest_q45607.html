		<p>Those fool Elyos are knocking on death's door with more and more Blood Crusaders joining the battle. </p>

		<p>I've often mused about how these supplies are packaged. I believe it involves blindfolds and several pitchers of wine.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Bottom line, I have no idea what's in these crates. But we do have an idea of the caliber of supplies contained within. For seven tokens, all you'll get is the lowest grade supplies. Come on, [%username], I'm sure you can slay a few more Elyos and get 15 or even 30 tokens.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>It's your decision, of course.</p>
