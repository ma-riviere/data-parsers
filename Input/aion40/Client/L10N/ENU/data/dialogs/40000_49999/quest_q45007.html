          <p>My fellow Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until recently, the Aetheric Field fluctuations had been stable in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we have detected possible fluctuations in a recording device--commissioned by the Pandaemonium Research Center--which we placed in a strategic location in that region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Immediately proceed to Beluslan and retrieve the Monitor Record from a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45007], then bring it to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never shall the Field fall.</p>

          <p>Yes, fellow Warden?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you by chance have a Monitor Record? I was expecting it today....</p>

          <p>No. I was told that a Field Warden would be bringing it to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you received a letter recently? Maybe the letter said something about a Field Monitor? It's quite urgent that I get that information processed today. Please do your duty, Warden.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You located the tower and brought the Monitor Record to the Beluslan Field Agent, who said there wasn't any major problem at this time.</p>
