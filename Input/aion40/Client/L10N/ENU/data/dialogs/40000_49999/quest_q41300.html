          <p>Yeah, I got a saddle-broke Pagati. Vicious thing, kill you as soon as look at you, but if you're more stubborn than he is, you can stay up there for a minute or two.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jasper isn't exactly friendly, but you can try to ride him if you want. Just take these reins outside camp and give him a call. But don't complain to me when he throws you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vesetia] over there thinks she's got Pagati figured out, but she hasn't even ridden my Jasper. She's one of them science types, don't like getting their hands dirty. I think she's just afraid of falling off.</p>

        <body>
          <p>I saw you riding Fudion's Pagati, the poor thing. He whips it whenever it bucks him off. No wonder the Pagati hates him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But can you imagine what a powerful cavalry we could build if we figure out how to truly tame them? You've faced off with mounted Balaur, haven't you? They're a force to behold!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think that the key lies in catching the Pagati while they're young and building up their trust. It's worth the effort, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Ah! I'm glad you agree, because I need some help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone to participate in a little experiment. Okay, a big experiment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to raise and tame a brood of Pagati and build a Reian cavalry. And I can do it--if you agree to help me.</p>

          <p>Fudion offered to let you ride his Pagati, Jasper. The ride was short, since Jasper hates Daevas, but it was still thrilling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You spoke to Vesetia about her research on Pagati taming, and she suggested that you help her out.</p>
