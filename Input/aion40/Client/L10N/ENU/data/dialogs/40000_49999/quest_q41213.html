          <p>"As insane as this undoubtedly sounds, I believe I have found evidence pointing towards the existence of a device that can bend time itself!</p>

          <p>"Unfortunately, it seems that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackFi_57_An]s have also learnt of the device, and are following me as though I carry it directly."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I... I cannot read on just yet, but there's enough information to go on for now. I feel obliged to carry on my father's work. Please attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackFi_57_An]s and scare them off this path they've taken.</p>

          <p>Time travel. Imagine it! The things we could redo, and the things we could undo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if it was nothing more than myth, the fact that my father pursued it... could that imply regret, or just a desire to see the events that changed us so fundamentally?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My curiosity is getting the better of me, I'm afraid. What about you, [%username]? Did you find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackFi_57_An]s?</p>

          <p>Good! Even if they didn't kill my father directly, they clearly contributed to his death. Revenge may not be the most articulate of actions, but by the five, it feels good!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I've been looking through this journal some more, and there's more to this story than meets the eye....</p>
