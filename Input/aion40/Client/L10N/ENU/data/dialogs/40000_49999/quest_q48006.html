          <p>If you say so. But despite what you may hear other Daevas say, no one can really go it alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At the very least, things go a lot faster and smoother when you have someone backing you up.</p>

          <p>That's the question the Marchutan Priory was founded to answer. We're devoted to helping Asmodian Daevas find new strength and skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One way we do it is by matching recently ascended Daevas with veterans who serve as Mentors through difficult missions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a way to gain direct combat experience while receiving protection and guidance. Join us if this intrigues you.</p>
