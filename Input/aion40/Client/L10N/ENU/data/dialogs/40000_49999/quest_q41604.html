          <p>Greetings, [%userrace] Daeva! You must tell me more about your people one of these days.  Right now, though, we have urgent matters to attend to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur Cavalry Base is becoming an increasingly painful thorn in our sides. The troops who come out of there are getting more dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've determined that it's because of the training they're getting from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_DrakanClaw_Named_58_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_DrakanWhip_Named_58_An]. We need you to decrease their effectiveness by killing either one of these instructors. Take either one you wish, but it must be done.</p>

          <p>I realize the Abyss War has been foolish and destructive. At the same time, I find it fascinating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your people and theirs, struggling in a dance of death.... Who will win? Or will you finally find peace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But enough of that for now. You had a mission, I believe.</p>

          <p>Good. The effectiveness of their troops should decrease drastically, thanks to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least for now. We must remain vigilant, lest they surprise us once again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here is your reward. But if you have time, could you tell me more about your home?</p>

          <p>Solteria said asked you to hamper Balaur troop effectiveness by slaying one of the instructors at the Balaur Cavalry Base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and returned to her gratitude--and questions about your people.</p>
