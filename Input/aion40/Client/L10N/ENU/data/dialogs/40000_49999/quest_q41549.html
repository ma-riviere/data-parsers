          <p>This grotto seems to get smaller every year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The real problem is that the Gurriki population is booming. They're in the middle of a terrible food shortage now, and competition for resources can get brutal. Some of them are starting to starve. I hate seeing them suffer, [%username]. It may seem cruel, but I think culling them down might be the kindest solution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuFi_57_An]s and the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuWi_57_An]s to lower the population. And, [%username]? Could you do it painlessly?</p>
