          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently, a crucial crystal record disappeared from an Aetheric Field Monitor in the Beluslan area. Somewhat ironically, we have traced this event not to any saboteur or thief, but to a hungry [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VaranusRe2D_29_n]. Apparently the crystals we use as recording devices have an appealing taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The data recorded on the crystal record is of a delicate and confidential nature, and we cannot risk it being discovered in the event that the Monitor regurgitates the crystal where our enemies might discover it. We must track down and kill the Monitor immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Field Wardens are urged to locate and terminate any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VaranusRe2D_29_n]s found in Beluslan. Recovery of the crystal post-mortem is not required, as the beast's own decomposition will destroy the record at that point. However, upon completing this mission, report the results to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007] immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Were you one of the Wardens asked to track down that hungry Blue Jaw Monitor? I knew those things had a big appetite, but the crystals in a Field Monitor? Unbelievable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, how did it go?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You destroyed several Blue Jaw Monitors and reported this to the Beluslan Field Agent, who rewarded you for your time.</p>
