        <body>
          <p>I've been worrying about the Urugugu Tribe Elites. They've been coming too close to the Seal for comfort--close enough that my allergies act up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sent some Zayedan troops into their garrison to push them back, but the Urugugu saw our forces coming. It was a total rout, and the Zayedan came back pecked half to death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Zayedan are good at stealth but not good enough to bypass the Urugugu [%dic:STR_DIC_FOBJ_LDF4a_Crystal_Ball_1]s. Those things are some of the most effective surveillance devices I've ever seen! You've proven you're good at cutting through the Strigik, so could you go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_04] and destroy Watcher's Spheres in the towers?</p>

          <p>You're back, and hardly a scratch on you. That's impressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could never sneak around the Urugugu Garrison. I'd start sneezing and give away my position.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So how did it go?</p>

          <p>... right. Look, I like you just fine, [%username], but I generally have just as strong a reaction to bird puns as I do to bird feathers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I hear another pun out of you, I may have a very violent allergic attack. Got it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work, otherwise. Our Guardian Seals are one of the most important Reian assets, so thank you for helping us keep this one safe.</p>

          <p>Woria was worried about the Urugugu Tribe Elites encroaching on the Guardian's Seal, but attempts to push them back were thwarted by the powerful Urugugu surveillance devices, the Watcher's Spheres.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You climbed the Urugugu watchtowers and destroyed the Watcher's Spheres, so the Urugugu Strigik will be easier to keep away from the Seal.</p>
