          <p>So, I believe you are now well-acquainted with our city and its key inhabitants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is much to do here, as this land is full of many perils, and the time to move against Lord Tiamat draws nigh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sarpan Zayedan Tribunus [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bargeni] has been told about you. Seek him out, and heed his words. Help us in any way you can.</p>

          <p>You must be [%username]. Ulstia told me you were coming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one thing it is vital you understand. My work--this land--cares nothing for Elyos, Asmodian, or Reian as individual peoples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here we are all Atreians, united in one goal. If we fight to benefit ourselves or harm another, we will all lose. We will all die.</p>

          <p>Indeed. The enmity between your races is old and deep. But you must overcome it if you seek any hope of victory over the Dragon Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is much to do here. The perils are, of course, great, but so are the potential rewards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your presence here speaks of much courage. I pray to Siel we can depend on you further in the future.</p>

          <p>Now that you've met Sarpan's major players, you were asked to seek Varzeni, an important Tribunus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You talked to Varzeni, who warned you to fight for Atreia, not for individual peoples.</p>
