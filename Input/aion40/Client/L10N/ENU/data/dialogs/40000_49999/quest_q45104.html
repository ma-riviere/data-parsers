		<p>Azphelumbra, Field Warden. I've heard your work in the field has helped our order immensely.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Of course, the real proof is the number of Ward Tokens you've earned. You can trade those in for special Warden Supplies. How many did you bring?</p>

		<p>For three Ward Tokens, I can give you Tier 1 Warden Supplies. But if you earn 7 or 15 tokens, you can trade those in for better supplies. So choose wisely.</p>

		<p>You have seven Ward Tokens? Impressive...that's at least a week's worth of work. That shows dedication.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>For seven tokens, I can give you Tier 2 Warden Supplies. I've given out a lot of those recently, but I don't think it'll be a problem--we have a lot more in store.</p>

		<p>Well, well.... Earning 15 Ward Tokens shows a level of dedication that's above and beyond the norm for a Field Warden. Many Wardens are eager to trade in lesser amounts of tokens for lower grade supplies. I respect your patience.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>You've definitely earned your Tier 3 Supplies. Are you ready to make the exchange?</p>

		<p>Hmmm...maybe you miscounted. You don't have as many tokens as you thought.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>We all make mistakes, Warden. No harm done--I've enjoyed our little chat. Next time, though, you should try to be a little more accurate in your token count.</p>
