          <p>I hope I can count on you, because a matter of great urgency has just been brought to my attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41157all] set out to seek shelter here in Kamar. They are now far overdue. There are also reports that they got separated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know there is a war going on, but I accepted a responsibility to aid all those in need--all. I take that responsibility seriously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have the time, please look for the missing refugees and tell them how to get here safely.</p>

          <p>You're an [%userrace]. I've heard tales of your people, but this is the first time I've ever seen one of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank Siel! When the others disappeared, I feared the worst. But I understand your kind fights for Atreia?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm perfectly fine, and I've taken a position I believe is easily defensible. So, as you can see, I can take care of myself.</p>

          <p>I'm so ashamed. I lost everything to the Balaur, so I deliberately separated myself from the group. I... I was hoping for death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then I dreamed of my parents, of everyone I lost. They begged me to live. I awoke with new determination... but no idea where I was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank Aion you found me. Just tell me how to get to Kamar, and I'll survive. For them!</p>

          <p>For the most part. Even the one who was once suicidal seems to better appreciate life now.</p>
          <p> </p>
           <p>I'm glad you were there to help. They weren't used to such peril, and so didn't know what to do when faced with such a situation alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Who knows what could've happened to them. But that will remain a moot question. All three asked me to pass on their thanks.</p>
