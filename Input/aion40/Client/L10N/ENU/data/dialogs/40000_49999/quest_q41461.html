          <p>Here for the Koligran, are you? I've a job for you, if you're ready to get stuck into a familiar enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragonbound have been growing in numbers recently, and it's about time we faced up to those scale scrubbers and reminded them of their idiocy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Specifically, I want you to deal with the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41461all] in Tiamaranta. Do your job, and you'll receive a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_02].</p>

            <p>I rather expected to see you elbow deep in Dragonbound guts. Seems you're a clean [%userclass], if nothing else.</p>

          <p>No, I suppose it doesn't. Death is death, whether it comes through bloody melee or a distant arrow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reports from Tiamaranta indicate the Dragonbound threat has diminished greatly since you started your Koligram task. I can only assume the two are linked, in which case many owe you a great deal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work, friend. Now... I believe I owe you one of these....</p>
