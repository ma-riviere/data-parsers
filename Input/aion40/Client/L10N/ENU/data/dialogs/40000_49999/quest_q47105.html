          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracles have decreed that Daevas attacking the Ice Claw Village need our aid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your mission is to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_25_35](s) you choose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Together, defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_47105all]s, then report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mephisto], who will reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>Good to hear. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was probably much easier for you than it was for your charges. I hope you remember your first days in Morheim, and take that into consideration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Who knows? Maybe what you did here today has launched a glorious future for a fellow Daeva. Nice work.</p>
