Should the Aetheric Field fall, all Asmodae--indeed, all Atreia--might fall with it. Obviously no one wants that to happen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should know that the Field Wardens are an autonomous organization. Pandaemonium supports our stated efforts, but does not direct us. Less bureaucracy means more efficiency, which is why I am able to offer you a position with our order right now.</p>
