          <p>[%username]! I've had a message for you. You're to go to the Beluslan Fortress and find Brigade General Nerita.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The quartermaster who just came through said that the Brigade General was looking for you. I wouldn't waste any time--get going.</p>

          <p>Do I know? Do I have nothing better to do here than take messages for you? If Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nerthus] wants to see you, she's probably going to give you an important mission. Why else would she try to track you down? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, get going so I can get back to work. Blood for blood. </p>

          <p>Spies have brought back information that they can use Aether. They probably learned it from the Balaur. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some Krall have gone mad, however, possibly from using too much Aether. They've begun attacking one another in great battles for no apparent reason. I want to know why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to bring me a sample of the Aether energy that drove them mad. I'm given to understand it's somewhere around the Kishar Village in Heiron. Go to the Ghost Village Observation Post and talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sorgrim]. He'll tell you how to get there. </p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]. I've been waiting for you. This is a dangerous mission, but Brigade General Nerita has confidence in your abilities. I've rarely seen her so impressed with anyone. Hope you live up to her expectations. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first difficulty you'll face is that the Krall are at least as agressive as the Mau. It's not going to be easy. </p>

          <p>The rift you'll need usually appears in Mahisha's Nest. It's a little to the southwest of Kidorun's Campsite. It only appears irregularly, though. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rift will take you to either the Grey Fog Marches or the Decayed Grove. If you arrive at the Grove, take the road south through Black Tears Swamp to get to the village. Pass the village and go up the hill to the east. You might find some insane Krall there.</p>
