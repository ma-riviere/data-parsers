          <p>[%username], I hate to ask it of you, but can you get the Kerubian Weapons that Coeus needs?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I owe him a favor, and as you've seen, he's somewhat hard to deal with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plus, there's nobody else I can ask to go all the way to Sanctum.</p>

          <p>So this one of the weapons those Kerubians use? This sword is elaborate: the pattern detailed, the blade razor sharp. </p>
