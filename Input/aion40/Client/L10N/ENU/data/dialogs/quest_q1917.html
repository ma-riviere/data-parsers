          <p>You've caused quite a stir! The Seraphim Lords usually choose new Daevas with backgrounds less...colorful, I suppose, than yours.</p>

          <p>Some Daevas cherish their lofty status but I'm not about to question the Seraphim Lords' judgment.</p>

          <p>True, true. Still, I can tell you're going to have to work extra hard to appease the stuffy aristocrats around here.</p>

          <p>Now, please don't take this the wrong way, but...I've never met a mercenary before.</p>

          <p>Not Akarios, surely? What a small world we live in!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to visit the Daminu Forest regularly--to bathe beneath a waterfall there. A beautiful place, so serene compared to the hectic pace here in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I gave up that serenity after one bad experience. Would you believe that someone stole my clothes one evening? What an outrage!</p>
