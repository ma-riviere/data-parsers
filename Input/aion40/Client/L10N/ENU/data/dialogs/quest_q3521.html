          <p>Thank Ariel you're here, [%username]! Aifemis has taken ill. She coughs up blood and hasn't eaten in days.</p>

          <p>It's those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BATRe2_40_An]s that sneak into the village at night. They feed on the corpses of our fallen, and then bring filth and disease back here with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's making everyone sick, especially the weak and the aged. They'll be back soon...you can smell their stench a mile away.</p>

          <p>Will you help us, [%username]? For the sake of Aifemis....</p>
