          <p>This is so frustrating. Brusthonin was a veritable breadbasket before the Cataclysm--you practically just had to drop a seed on the ground for it to take root. Now, though, the soil is practically ruined. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium tried many times to purify the contaminated region, but up until now we've always failed. We learned a lot, and I have every reason to believe this effort will succeed, but that doesn't mean I'm not irritated by the senseless waste of it all. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With Lumiel's guidance, I know we'll succeed this time!</p>

          <p>Hmm. That's a good question. Probably--there's almost always something to be done. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for me, I've been studying the contamination in the Polluted Waste, just north of here. I tested the soil, and I think there's hope, Lumiel be praised! The contamination levels aren't nearly as high as they were.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The next thing to do is study the effects of contamination of living creatures. That's easier said than done, though--Hey. That's a thought. Still want something to do, [%username]?.</p>

          <p>Glad to hear it--they look a lot stronger than mine, for sure. I'm not really a warrior, after all. This Legion prefers studies to fights.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the time that's all well and good, but this time...well, the creatures I need samples from, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CornD_20_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VespaD_20_n]s, are both very violent. That's where you come in, naturally. A [%userclass] like yourself shouldn't have much trouble collecting them, though, right?</p>

          <p>Oh...all right. Honestly...it's my hair. You wouldn't believe the effort it takes out here to keep it looking just so. I can't stand the thought of it getting mussed. It would take hours to get it back just right again.</p>

          <p>Your hair, though...obviously your hair's used to this sort of thing. Are you sure you won't help me?</p>
