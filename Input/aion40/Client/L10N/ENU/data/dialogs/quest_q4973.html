          <p>You know, darling...there was a time when I wore all the garments I created. I wanted to feel bold, dramatic, even a little ostentatious! I still design with those traits in mind, but behind all the glamour lurks a dark past. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was born poor, and I first learned to sew because I needed new clothes. But soon I found that I had a passion for design. I wanted to be more than functional, I wanted to fabulous! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I donned the first dress I created and walked the streets of Pandaemonium, I was gazed upon with envy. It was the first time I experienced such a feeling! I had achieved fame! Later I was taken on by a master designer as his pupil, and now I am the master. </p>

          <p>I never have doubts, darling. Doubts are degrading to one who has achieved so much. But since I first started designing, I have always been my own inspiration, my own model. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I like what I see in the mirror--I mean, who wouldn't? It was that confidence that led me to open this costume shop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that I serve others for the first time, I am starting to have doubts. I want to know if women truly enjoy wearing the clothing that I create, and I need you to help me discover the truth. </p>

          <p>How ridiculous is it that I, the great Marra, am stressed over something like this? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I blame that fool Usener. He was insolent enough to ask me if I was designing for others, or for myself. He filled me with doubt, and now I am uncertain. I am a great designer, but perhaps I am a bad merchant. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Help me find the answers I seek, darling, and your efforts will not go unrewarded. I will provide you with the names of my most recent clients: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lidorasa] of Pandaemonium, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lapion] of Beluslan, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Frenai] of Morheim.</p>

          <p>Oh, you're familiar with Marra? It seems like all the girls these days know about her. I'm a fan of Daskin's designs as well, but Marra's are simply marvelous.</p>

          <p>I'm not one to give in to extravagance, but I just couldn't help myself. I do receive the occasional compliment on what I'm wearing now, but these are just from the merchant association. </p>

          <p>The dress I bought from Marra, on the other hand, just radiates style. I even outshine the girls in Vanahal. I love the dress, and I have no regrets about purchasing it.</p>

          <p>I didn't buy that dress... An admirer bought it and sent it to me. It was supposed to be a gift in exchange for a painting, but it's quite an expensive dress, and the painting wasn't my best work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to wonder if my estranged husband sent it... I left him because I couldn't stand being poor. But if he bought that dress, where would he have gotten the money? </p>

          <p>I love the dress, but it's far too elegant for someone like me to wear. However, it does allow me to dream of being someone else! </p>
