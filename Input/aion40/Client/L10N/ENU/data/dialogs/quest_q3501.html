          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're going there, I'd like to ask you for a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know we're not that well acquainted and I hesitate to ask, but something has been on my mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be honest, I have no one else to ask. Please accept my request.</p>

          <p>You'll find a person called Altina  in B5.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She is the mother of a friend of mine, and she recently took a journey there. I fear for her safety.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well... She's lost something precious.... She's lost her daughter to the Fanatics. She went seeking revenge in the wilderness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help out on this one? </p>
