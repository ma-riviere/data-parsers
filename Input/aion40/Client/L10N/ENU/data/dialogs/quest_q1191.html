          <p>Ah, Daeva! Do you have a moment? I've something to ask you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you come across the Verteron Observatory? A bit out of the way, through the Krall camp and all, but you can get a flight there with ease.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a terribly important message that must be delivered there. I can't bring it myself, yet I can't risk its interception....</p>

          <p>Yes. I know you must have endless tasks ahead of you, but this really is important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many lives hang in the balance, and you'd be doing me a great service.</p>

          <p>Will you help? Will you deliver this letter to Khidia at the Observatory?</p>
