          <p>Every now and again someone asks us to clean up [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA13]. I usually just laugh. The Dukaki Kobolds overran that place long ago--it's a lost cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this time it's about Odium, and where there's Odium there's Aether. We have no choice but to get involved.</p>

          <p>You remember that little Odium-mining operation the Kobolds were running in Poeta? Well that was small zigis compared to this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it the Krall who are ordering them to refine Odium? We don't know the answer to that, but whoever it is, we have to stop them. There's no time to waste.</p>

          <p>I have some new information about how the Kobolds are refining Odium.</p>

          <p>My scouts say that [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA125]%, one of the Kobold supervisors, has some kind of refining potion she got from the Tursin Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They use only a small amount of potion, and only at certain intervals. Use too much, and you neutralize the Odium. And neutralizing the Odium is exactly what we want to do.</p>
