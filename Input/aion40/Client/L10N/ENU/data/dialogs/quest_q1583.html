          <p>The longer the war against the Krall lasted, the more people fled the Manor. Many children lost their parents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Orphans trudged the roads, grubbing food like animals, sleeping in ditches. It was awful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Amalen was different. Most other adults looked to their own needs, but she took care of the children as if they were her own.</p>

          <p>But she and the children were never safe from Krall attack. Now, they wander the land around the orphanage, undead but unaware of their fate.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I hate to think of those children roaming restless and tormented, when Amalen's one wish was to offer them love and peace.</p>

          <p>If you go south from here, you'll see a stone wall and the frame of a gate leading to a house. In the yard, children who became Boggarts wander about, and Amalen the Forlorn sobs.</p>
