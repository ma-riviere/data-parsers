          <p>Ah, [%username]! Glad to see you again. I was so busy last time that I didn't have time to thank you. I really appreciated your help in testing the new flight route.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By way of saying thanks, I have a job opportunity. It's a little dangerous, but you should be able to handle it, and the pay is exceptional.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you interested?</p>

          <p>Well, I received new orders from my superiors a few days ago. It seems they're tired of taking out the low-ranked punks and they want to get serious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm authorized to carry out operations directly against important figures we can identify at the Bastion. These are precision strikes, and we need Ariel's finest to make sure the hits are successful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think? Are you interested?</p>

          <p>Good. I've been waiting for the go-ahead to hit these guys hard, and I want to make it count.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first target is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparFiNamedQ_38_Ae]. Your second target is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparPrNamedQ_38_Ae]. They won't be easy to get at, but losing them will be a real blow to the Lepharist command structure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of Ariel be with you.</p>

          <p>Gennaion and Epicara were absolutely central to the command of the Bastion. This should throw their operations into disarray for a while.</p>
