          <p>Great. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gerania] was restoring that report for me. It's probably ready by now, so you should pick that up first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've got it, you can take it plus the Body Tissue to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hygea], the best Daeva in the Temple of Life.</p>

          <p>Ah...well, let me take a look at this. Hmm...interesting. This is more like the body tissue of a Daeva than that of Human. It has stronger Aether energy, though, and reproduces faster than a Daeva's would....</p>

          <p>It's as though this Daeva was...artificially strengthened....</p>

          <p>It's unstable, though, that's for sure. I wonder what they did....</p>

          <p>You met Hygea and handed over the tissue sample. She explained that RM-78c was a Daeva whose physical power was artificially strengthened, but that the tissue was unstable.</p>

          <p>When you reported Hygea's analysis to Xenophon, he said that future operations would be more dangerous, and asked you to continue to carry out missions.</p>
