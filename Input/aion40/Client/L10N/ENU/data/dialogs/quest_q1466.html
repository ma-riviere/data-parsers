          <p>Deltras. Brigade General Deltras of the Storm Legion. We were under his command. The Storm Legion was sent to explore the Abyss. We ran into Draconutes and soundly thrashed them. We explored farther into the Abyss, thinking there would be more of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Somehow we found ourselves in Asmodae. We tried our best to keep ourselves a secret from the Asmodians. But eventually we met Zikel, their Lord of Destruction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He cursed our Seraphim Lord Nezekan and commanded us to kneel to him! Ultimately, we were massacred on this very spot.</p>
