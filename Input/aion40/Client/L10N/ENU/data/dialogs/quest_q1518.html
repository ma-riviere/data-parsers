          <p>I doubt you're here on a sightseeing trip. You must have some mission from the generals back in Heiron.</p>

          <p>My reinforcements haven't arrived yet. Could you help me?</p>

          <p>I'm trying to gather information on the Indratu Legion's leadership. But I can't get into the fortress itself--too many Draconutes and Nagarants swarming around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So far, the reinforcements Heiron promised haven't showed up. It's just me. I have a plan, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ever fought a Drakan? They look a little like the Draconutes, but they're much smarter--and they have strong magic.</p>

          <p>I've caught glimpses of Drakan inside the fortress. With their magic, they'll spot me easily. But if someone like you kills the Drakan, it would make the fortess easier to infiltrate.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would also crush the morale of the Draconutes and Nagarants, who practically worship the Drakan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go inside the fortress and get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanFighter_47_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanAssassin_47_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanWizard_47_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanPriest_47_Ae]s? I'll reward you with every last Kinah I have.</p>

          <p>Your victory might be short-lived, though. They reinforce the troops very quickly. If you come back this way again, I might ask for another round of Drakan tail-gathering.</p>
