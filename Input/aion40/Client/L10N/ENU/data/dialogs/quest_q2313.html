          <p>I'm sure it was a Gadill. I can't even count how many times this has happened now.</p>

          <p>Oh. Well, I can see where that might sound rather silly. It's just that the only reason I'm here is to catch some Gadill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been fishing all over Atreia, and I've caught practically every kind of fish there is...except for Gadill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You would think that of all the fish in the world I'd have caught one already, but I haven't, and it's driving me mad.</p>

          <p>You laugh, but this is truly frustrating. This time I prepared everything with Gadill in mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just when conditions are perfect, though, just when a Gadill is about to bite, those spiteful Monitors run in and splash around in the water and ruin everything!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They know I hate them, I can tell. Whenever I try to hunt them myself, they run off. Perhaps, though...perhaps you could approach them? Could you get rid of some of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VaranusReD_24_An]s so I can catch some Gadill?</p>

          <p>If you kill nine [%dic:STR_DIC_M_VaranusReD_24_An]s, the rest will probably run off and leave me in peace. Let me know when you're done.</p>
