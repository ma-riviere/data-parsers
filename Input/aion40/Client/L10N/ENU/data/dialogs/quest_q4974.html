          <p>Thanks for helping me earlier, darling. You were a lifesaver. But I still can't believe that I, the great Marra, let someone see me doubting myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're quite ravishing, [%username]. I'm sure you understand. It's acceptable for a woman of stature to appear vulnerable in front of someone so good-looking. Damsels in distress, and all that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though I fear I haven't repaid my previous debt, would you mind if I ask another favor?</p>

          <p>You know Daskin from next door, darling? I promise, there's no need to be jealous. I just want to know where he gets his inspiration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have utmost confidence in the garments I create for women. However, his designs are so delicate and enchanting, I think many women would be interested in his clothing. His talent rivals my own, but he's a man! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How does he do it? I want to know his secret. I'm afraid my pride keeps me from asking him myself, but I was hoping you'd be willing to help.</p>

          <p>I've heard that men are better suited to appreciate a woman's beauty. Though I think that is nonsense, dear, I still have to wonder if there is some truth to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you see Daskin's clothes... [%username], what do you think? Are they not glamorous and alluring? Though I suppose not all Daevas are interested in that kind of thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Timogand], and perhaps he will let you in on his secret.</p>

          <p>Marra wants to know how I create such gorgeous clothing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, unlike her, I don't just design clothes that I would like to wear. I mean, that would just be silly... A man wearing women's clothes...a beautiful man...a sensitive man...who just wants to be accepted for who he is...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry, [%username]. I get emotional when I talk about fashion design. Yes, that's it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Women and men have different frames, different facial features, and different hairstyles. A true designer can take in all those factors, and create a genuinely unique design based on the individual. That's the secret to successful design. </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm just going to stick with my way. Clients don't get to tell me what they want. I tell them what they want, and they'll like it! That way no woman, no matter what her body type, can resist the clothes I create. You helped prove that to me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I'm afraid I can't offer a discount at the boutique, but you're always welcome here. In fact...I'm hoping you'll stop by more often. I'm sure I can think of all kinds of things you can do for me....</p>
