          <p>I found this ribbon near the Arena a while ago. Looks like a good luck present to me...from some woman whose lover is fighting in the Arena, I shouldn't wonder. Only he's gone and lost it.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>You'll find that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Galm], the Arena Master, is a particularly reliable source of information. He's uncanny--he could probably name anyone who frequents the Arena.</p>

          <p>No, I haven't seen anyone wearing this, but this design--a square shield, stitched in black and gold? It's the Meert family crest.</p>
