           <p>I'm glad you asked! Most I've spoken to have just rolled their eyes and tottered off like Elrocos after nuts!</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>I was busying myself making treats for the Harvest Revel, bought all the ingredients I needed and was cleaning out the pots and pans, when the damned [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_Shulackwizard_99_n]s popped up out of nowhere and stole all my sugar!</p>
	   			 <p> </p>  
           <p>Now I have a vague idea where they are, but I'm no tracker, and I'm certainly nothing like as strong as you. I need help, [%username]! I need those cretins to be taught a good lesson!</p>

          <p>Excellent news! Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, as I said I have a vague idea as to their whereabouts. Friends of mine have seen some sneaky, chattering fellows hiding near [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09]. You should go there and make sure they don't steal from me again.</p>
	  			<p> </p>
          <p>I've ordered replacement sugar, but I can't afford that to be stolen, else there will only be tricking for this year's Harvest Revel, and no treating whatsoever.</p>
