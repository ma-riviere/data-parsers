          <p>By the way, that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vison], the Drakie, has no gratitude at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She fed that thing Bloodwing meat and treated it like royalty and it still ran away. What an annoying creature! I hate pets.</p>

          <p>Oh, I'm still going to catch it. I just don't like it very much. But if that's what it takes to win Jamanok's affections, I'll do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An animal like a Drakie is going to be where its food is. If it's not home to get its regular meal of Bloodwing meat, it's probably going to be where there are plenty of Bloodwings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, that's the first place I'll look.</p>

          <p>Sure. It's always easier for two hunters to catch something. I'm betting the little thing has gone to the Marla Cave. That place is swarming with Bloodwings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best plan is for you to speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vison], and figure out what'll get him back here. Can you do that for me?</p>
