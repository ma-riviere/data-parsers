          <p>I'm worried about my little girl.</p>

          <p>She sits in that kitchen all day, and doesn't seem to have any friends. I want her in the family business, but she'll have none of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But finally my daughter has taken an interest in something.</p>

          <p>I don't know if it's because the Manduri use fruit as weapons, or if it was some dish Octavia suggested, but Adelphie wants some of their Red Thorn Fruit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know they eat the same fruit they throw at people, so I'm guessing they store the good fruit in [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LF2_Lambutan_Q1486]s in the Manduri Village and Manduri Stores.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you collect some of the better fruit? I know it would cheer up my little girl.</p>
