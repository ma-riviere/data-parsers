          <p>Before you go, you should know that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_AkanNamed_50_Al] wields great power here in Heiron. The Elyos have been unable to kill him, no matter how they try. He commands hordes of Undead who serve him unconditionally. This entire area is under his rule, so step carefully. </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you truly wish to find him, you'll need your wings. Bollvig is on the highest of those floating islands, just over there. If you must go, be mindful of his terrible anger.   </p>

          <p>Very well, then. If you must, you must. Fly to the island--he'll be somewhere near the center, most likely. You may be attacked along the way--not all his minions are as discerning as I am. Be careful and good luck! </p>

He revealed his goal, to kill those responsible for Myanee's death, and gave Betoni a message to search for him no more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned to Betoni and delivered Bollvig's words. Betoni said that he could not allow his friend to perish in such a hopeless task, and that he would find a way to bring Bollvig back to Asmodae.</p>
