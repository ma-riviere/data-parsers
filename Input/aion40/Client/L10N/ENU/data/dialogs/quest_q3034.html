        <p>News about the Artifact has spread faster that a Shugo can nyerk! Letters are coming from Artifact scholars everywhere. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Did you run into a large Kerubiel named Achrael out there? According to this letter, he's the Artifact Protector.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The scholars say the Artifact has lost power because there's no Aetheric Field out there. They also said that I need an Activation Stone to operate it. Unfortunately the Artifact Protector probably has the stone.</p>

          <p>I feel I'm getting close to the secret of the Artifact. If we can tap into its Aetheric power, perhaps we can restore the sea and heal these lands...put a halt to this endless war...with that sort of power...well let's just say it'll change things around here.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_Cherubim4Gi200NamedQ_47_An] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3034a] must be somewhere near the Artifact. Find them, Daeva. Please hurry!</p>

          <p>So, the old scholar was right. Let's see...hmm...I can see that it's a Temporal Stone by its shape, but it looks ancient. I can't feel any power...I hope it's not too late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I have to find out how this activates the Artifact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, keep this. It's a token of my gratitude for your assistance.</p>
