          <p>This land was once ruled by the drake Minushan. No one dared to oppose his cruel tyranny.</p>

          <p>The legend says that 12 brave Warriors came and killed Minushan, freeing the land. During the fight, one of his hands was severed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With his last breath, though, Minushan cursed Seggurheim, saying he would never loosen his grasp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His body was reduced to bones. You can still see them today. Scholars say they are the vehicle of his revenge--if they were ever reassembled, they could summon his spirit once more!</p>

          <p>Isn't it just? I think that parts of the legend are true and the strange occurrences around here are due to the curse. It seems like maybe now is the time to summon the vengeful spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Minushan returns to this realm, he will be powerful--and mortal. Summoning his spirit with the proper safeguards could vanquish him once and for all!</p>
