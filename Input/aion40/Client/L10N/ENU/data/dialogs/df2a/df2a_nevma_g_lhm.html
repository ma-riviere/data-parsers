          <p>Centurion Ikelus was trying to lead the Griffon's Claw Legion back to Sanctum after an Abyss battle, but somehow the Abyss Gates got mixed up and we ended up here in Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We managed to stave off the Asmodian attack and get a message back home. I'm so glad they were able to generate a Dimensional Vortex to get to us. I never thought I'd see Elysea again!</p>
