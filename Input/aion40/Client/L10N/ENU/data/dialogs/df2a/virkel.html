          <p>The Red Sky Legion protected Brusthonin from the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We carried out our mission dutifully, even though we couldn't survive. But we were fortunate to be buried in the land we gave our lives for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only regret that we couldn't protect Lord Triniel.</p>
