          <p>Ah, it's good to see you, [%username]. Most young Daevas try to avoid dangerous and unpleasant assignments these days. You help to restore my faith.</p>

          <p>The very reason we have such power and Eternal life is so that we can travel to these places to fight instead of Humans!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came to Brusthonin to fight the undead, but the problems just keep coming. Thank the Lords for brave young Daeva like yourself willing to face them.</p>
