          <p>Brusthonin is a tough place to live now, but even before the Cataclysm this area was a war zone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion are the most famous casualties, but many Daevas gave their lives to keep the Balaur out of here. May Lord Triniel bless the souls sacrificed!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sadly, Brusthonin was decimated in the Cataclysm. Nearly everyone was killed.</p>

        	<p>That didn't start until later, after people started to move back in. It didn't take long for Brusthonin to become a barren, inhospitable land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nobody knows for sure what caused the contamination, but I think the Balaur must have something to do with it.</p>
