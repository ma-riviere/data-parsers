          <p> </p>
          <p>Is that really the Siel's Supreme Greatsword? Where did you get such a thing? And how?</p>

          <p>This is.... Oh no! That's too bad. The sword seems to have been seriously damaged! See this, here, where the blade is notched? That weakens the entire weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only with the proper restoration will this sword truly live up to its full potential. Are you interested in restoring it to its former glory?</p>

          <p>Regrettably, I don't have the skills to fix the sword--I wish I did! However, I do know who can help you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to go to Rhonnam Refugee Village and look for a Kobold named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan]. He may be a Kobold, but he's a fine blacksmith, and his mastery of weapons knows no equal. At least, that's what the stories say. I've never met him myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If anyone can help you, it's him.</p>

          <p>Why not? Do you think you already own a better weapon? Does this legendary blade not matter to you? How can that be?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose if you're not interested, I can't force you. But I do urge you to reconsider. That sword is a work of art, and it deserves to be restored properly.</p>

          <p>Why is Daeva here?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it about a weapon? Tataka can see from here sword is badly damaged. Looks like Daeva was chewing on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is Daeva hungry? Tataka has mookie cookies baking in the forge right now. Healthy, and full of iron. That part accidental.</p>

          <p>Let me see if.... Wait. This is Siel's Supreme Greatsword! Used by Siel's Spear Legion, long ago, ancestors  of Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Looks bad, though. Very rough, no good like this. Good for cutting hair maybe. Do Daevas cut hair?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Tataka will help restore sword's powers, after cookies finish baking. Don't want crumbs getting on ancient relic.</p>
