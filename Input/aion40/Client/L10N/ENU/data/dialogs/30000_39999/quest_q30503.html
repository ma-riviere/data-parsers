          <p>Excuse me. Did I hear you were entering Rentus Base? I am one of the lucky escapees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But those who were asleep in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDYun_SZ_3] likely got caught by surprise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rodelion]! I should never have let Oreitia drag me away. Your face haunts my nights.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, erase my shame and rescue him.</p>

          <p>Y-you're my rescue squad, are you? Not quite what I pictured.</p>

          <p>Still, they say any rescue you can walk away from is a good one. And Lition sent you? Siel bless his stubbornness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give me a moment, and I'll retreat to rest up, so I can repay the Balaur for all this. Which way to the portal?</p>

          <p>You're back! You can't imagine how I felt when I saw Rodelion stride through that portal like nothing was amiss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He had high praise for your efforts. He's resting now, but he wanted me to thank you again on his behalf.</p>

          <p>For Rodelion and me, it's quite something. Many comrades are still missing, but I now feel like I had some impact on the situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And don't think your work is going unnoticed. I've seen more and more representatives of Sanctum welcomed around here of late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This reward is paltry compared to my gratitude, but please, take it in the spirit in which it is intended.</p>
