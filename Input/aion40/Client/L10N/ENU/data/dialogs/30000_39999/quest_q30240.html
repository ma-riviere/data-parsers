          <p>Greetings, Daeva. I couldn't help but notice that you still carry Noble Siel's Supreme Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I can interest you in enhancing it into Siel's Dominant Orb? But this new orb is no ordinary orb, my friend. Its powers are unmatched on the battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are waiting for the catch, there is none. I will accept no payment for this.</p>

          <p>There is one caveat, Daeva. You must procure the items needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it shouldn't be that difficult for a [%userclass] like you...you've probably seen and done it all before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in addition to obtaining the items, you'll also need to do some forging yourself. Still sound good?</p>

        <body>
          <p>As we discussed, I will need a few items before we can begin. You'll need to get Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>Of course you could continue to use the orb you have now.... But why not gain power when you have the chance?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I urge you to reconsider. I will be here when you do.</p>

          <p>Take a breath and think of what you are asking me, Daeva. I am already working on enhancing a weapon for you--I cannot work on two at the same time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's just focus on the weapon you're already working on for now, shall we?</p>

          <p>I know you want to upgrade your orb, Daeva, but I explained the exact process you must follow. You pull on one boot at a time, right? It is the same with my instructions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] before going to the Jotun Studio to make the essence.</p>
