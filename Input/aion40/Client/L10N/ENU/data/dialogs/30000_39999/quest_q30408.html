          <p>Uh, Daeva? Do you believe in dreams? Do you believe that we should strive to make them come true?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, Sesinerk has always wanted to fly. Not on airship, but with wings of her own. Only way to do that is to become Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30408A] of a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Ranger_60_Ah] from [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDElemental_2] could do it, but force field is still around that place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Sesinerk hears that you, Daeva, are able to get in! You said you believed in dreams, right? So help Sesinerk with hers?</p>

          <p>Do not get me wrong.... Sesinerk loves being Shugo. But if becoming Daeva is price to be paid, I will pay it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And maybe if this works, can sell to other Shugos who want to fly for a little while! So much Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you find Golem's Heart? Can Sesinerk become Daeva now?</p>

          <p>Oh, could this be it? Could dream finally come true? Could Sesinerk finally fly in the air?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rumor says must hold heart close to own heart... close eyes... absorb Aether into body....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. Do not feel different.... Do not look any different! No change! No wings at all! Heart was worthless, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Sesinerk heard that a special golem's heart might enable her to become a Daeva so she can fulfill her dream of flying with her own wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Argent Manor and got the Golem's Heart for her. Sadly, but perhaps unsurprisingly, it didn't work.</p>
