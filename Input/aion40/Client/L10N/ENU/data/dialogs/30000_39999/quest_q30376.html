          <p>Go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vare] in Russet Plaza at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_3] for the rest. My job was just to find the right Daeva for the job. But I promise you, you'll be interested in what she has to say.</p>

          <p>Tepes? Oh, I know what this is about then. I told him I needed a Daeva to investigate an [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_02_SZ_All] that formed near the Divine Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We had a couple of scouts come back, reporting that this new Splinter is even worse than the Abyssal Splinter you may have dealt with before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Divine Fortress in Reshanta and meet up with [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Ab1_1011_TreasureGate_Da]. She'll give you any additional information you need.</p>
