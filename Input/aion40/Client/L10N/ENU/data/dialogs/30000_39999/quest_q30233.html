          <p>I thought you agreed with me that Flarestorm must be freed from his Balaur prison?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told you it might take multiple attempts to return it to the flow of Aether. The poor thing is heavily saturated in their filth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It can only be resurrected through its pure form.</p>

          <p>He's only partly one with the Aether, [%username]. He needs to be fully vanquished now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need the Incinerator Key to free the Spirit. No, this isn't the key you used earlier.... It's special.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can create the key through magic, but it will require many different items and a lot of concentration. Can you help me?</p>

          <p>Faith and arms, [%username]. You'll first need to get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30228a]s from Hoodwink Gnarls and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30230a]s from the Dracunis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that, obtain [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30229a]s from Vilethorn Laupedes and Burrowing Laupedes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lastly, pluck [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30231a] sfrom Steelbeak Gryphu. I think you've already procured most of these already, so it shouldn't be that hard to do it again.</p>

          <p>Look, just because you already helped Flarestorm once doesn't give you the right to take this any less seriously.</p>

          <p>How many times did you think it would take to return Flarestorm to the flow of Aether? You can forget about once. It's been imprisoned there since before the Cataclysm! It may take thousands of times to set it free.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, please, bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30228a]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30229a]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30230a]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30231a]s so that I can create a key to the Blue Flame Incinerator.</p>
