          <p>This is a remarkable discovery, [%username]! This ancient document you found is full of Balaur history, legends, burial rites!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know what it says here? It tells of a conjuring ceremony the Balaur use! It describes in perfect detail where this ceremony takes place, and the potion they use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this, we can find out what in the shadows this Stormwing is and why it was sealed inside Beshmundir Temple.</p>

          <p>It's...it's hard to decipher this part. A gland of some sort...maybe an oil. I'll work on it....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It says where it's located, and what you need to do to get it...but what is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to find it, whatever it is, in order to figure out what this Stormwing is, and why it was locked in the temple. Will you lend a wing, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Fra...Fragrant...oh, what we need to make the potion is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30207a]s! I had forgotten what this symbol meant...it's been some time since my schooling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The document is very clear about how to obtain it--you must kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Dragonfly_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_DragonSnake_55_An]s at Angrief Wastes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This could really be a huge find for us, [%username]. I'll decode the rest of the document while you get Fragrant Oil Glands.</p>

          <p>This is very peculiar...substance. It's a sickly sweet sort of smell, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that remains now is the actual ceremony.... I must see what Stormwing is! It's strange, but I feel almost drawn to it...compelled to awaken it.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. Maybe you should have pursued a life of research instead of being a [%userclass].</p>
