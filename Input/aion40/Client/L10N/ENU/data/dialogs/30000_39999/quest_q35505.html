          <p>Subject: Confirmation just in; Asmodians and Balaur have commenced battle in Gelkmaros. Intelligence speculates that this situation will enable a small, quick strike force to infiltrate and drive the Asmodians from Balaurea.</p>

          <p>Orders: Commence immediately. Use the Silentera Canyon to infiltrate [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_DF4] and terminate a minimum of five combat-worthy Asmodians in Gelkmaros. Once your mission is complete, report to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35503].</p>

          <p>There've been hordes of Daevas heading towards the Silentera Canyon and Gelkmaros today. I've seen nothing but battle reports and casualties all day. Exhausting.</p>

          <p>[%username], were you able to complete your mission?</p>

          <p>I just received confirmation of your mission's success, [%username]. Well done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even large forces have been known to get annihilated in Gelkmaros if they let their guard down. Aion's grace must have been shining on you today. But, I guess our covert tactics in Radiant Ops are particularly effective in these types of situations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Radiant Ops HQ sent this reward over for you. Congratulations.</p>
