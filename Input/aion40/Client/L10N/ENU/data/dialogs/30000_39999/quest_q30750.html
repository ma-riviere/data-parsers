          <p>The Reian Tribe has decided not to wait for the Elyos and Asmodians, and to attack the Tiamat Stronghold with their entire force!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun talks a lot about how he doesn't trust either side, but it's an obvious scheme for the Reians to get Siel's Relics before either the Elyos or Asmodians can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to Lord Marchutan, we will be able to join the attack, whether Kahrun wants us to or not. Now go! The Reians are beginning their attack soon! Gather your allies and proceed to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must get there before the Reians, or Siel's Relics will be lost to us.</p>

          <p>Tiamat should have died in the attack. That was the plan, but something must have gone wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter, it only postpones the inevitable. When the repairs are complete, I will proceed directly to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_T1].</p>

          <p>So the entrance to the Dragon Lord's Refuge wasn't at Tiamat Stronghold? That was... unexpected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then who told you where the entrance was really located? No, I don't have time to worry about that now. Not when Kahrun is headed directly for the Dragon Lord's Refuge.</p>

          <p>Skafir asked you to get into the Tiamat Stronghold and claim Siel's Relics before the Reians could.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>While fighting the enemy in the stronghold, you met Vhasha, an imprisoned Balaur prophet, who begged you to kill Brigade General Tahabata, lest the attack fail. His advice helped you to secure the Tiamat Stronghold. However, you couldn't find the entrance to the Dragon Lord's Refuge.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>Garnon said that she had information on the true location of the entrance, and that Kahrun would advance on the refuge as soon repairs were finished. You would have to hurry if you wanted to join him.</p>
