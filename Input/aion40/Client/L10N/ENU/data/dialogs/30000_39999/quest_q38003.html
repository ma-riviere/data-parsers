          <p>Working at the transporter in Elysea's biggest city means that I talk to a lot of different people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently, I spoke with some members of the Alabaster Order. They asked me to deliver a message if I ever saw you.</p>

          <p>You know how it is. Wings are for working and all that.</p>

          <p>They asked me to tell you that their president, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] in Heiron, wants to recruit you specifically. They thought it was an honor to be asked to join, rather than to be a simple volunteer.</p>

          <p>Of course! Our illustrious society is called the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand--though we generally just use "Alabaster Order"--and, in concert with Sanctum, we acquire information on dark deeds and look after the Elyos in our region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have a number of driven, talented Daevas on our rolls, and they stay with us both because they believe in our cause and also because they appreciate our rewards. We send out letters with our calls to action, and those who complete missions are rewarded with a Progress Token. Those tokens can later be exchanged with a steward for a reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With a talent like yours on the membership rolls, we'd be sure to thrive!</p>
