          <p>Were you eavesdropping? Do the [%userrace] people not teach you manners? Ugh. No matter. The Magic Cage is finished.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Yilios] uses it properly, he should be able to capture a Glowing Spirit safely.</p>

          <p>I, of course, am much too busy to deliver it myself. I'd send for a common messenger, but since you're here already...</p>

          <p>Oh, I can't wait to see if the drawings do the Glowing Spirits justice.... Even through them, I can see how cute...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eh? Oh, it's you! Pardon my distraction; the prospect of seeing these Spirits in the flesh, as it were, is... exciting.</p>

          <p>A Magic Cage! Of course! In my defense, these haven't been used for at least a century now, so naturally I forgot about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But as useful as theory is, it's nothing until it's put into practice. There's still so many factors we can't be aware of.</p>

          <p>Still, it's a chance. And what else can we do but leap on chances as they present themselves? Good work!</p>
