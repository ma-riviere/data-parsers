          <p>Ah... a wandering soul, so full of vigor, comes to a rotting Drakan, trapped in the same cell that has ended so many others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You stand before the great prophet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bhasha]. I foresaw the Dragon Lord [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA52]'s downfall, and for having the temerity to suggest that her immortality was not guaranteed, I was silenced and sent here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worse, the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30706a] took my book of prophecies. What is a prophet without prophecies, or a knight without a quest? My book is what gives me reason, Daeva. I need it back.</p>

          <p>You met Vhasha, child? Even I've heard that name before--the Balaur hold him in high regard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now this book is remarkable... so many of our events were foretold. Look here, the assault on Balaurea, and here! "...the warring twins siding under one-winged cohesion..." that must refer to the peace Kahrun forged between us and the Asmodians!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a remarkable find, [%username]!</p>

          <p>You met the Balaur prophet Vhasha, who once foretold of Tiamat's death, and was thrown into prison for the "crime". He asked you to retrieve his book of prophecies from the Drakan Thieves that had tormented him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You managed to find the book, and took it to Pernos to look over. He was amazed at the accuracy of the prophecies, and rewarded you for your find.</p>
