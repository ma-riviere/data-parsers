          <p>For the Eyes of [%username] Only:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Priest Trou contacted the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand to report an attack on Heiron Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This could be disastrous! However, his reports haven't always been reliable, and we need you to acquire solid information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], go speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Trou] and find out the truth of the situation. Then report to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Should your information reveal a critical attempt on Heiron Observatory, the Alabaster Order will stand ready to defend our divine outpost!</p>

          <p>It was horrible! Horrible! The smell of sulfur and corruption. The dark night hiding a rush of even darker wings. Our Observatory covered over by those who would harm the Elyos for the mere sadistic pleasure of it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw it in a dream, and it terrified me to the core.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Clearly, it is an omen of a dark event to come.</p>

          <p>Well, good work from you all the same, [%username]. Sometimes a warning like Priest Trou's turns into a real lead, and we must be ever vigilant in order to protect Elysea and serve Sanctum.</p>

          <p>...even if it means dealing with ridiculous reports sometimes. </p>

          <p>Aiskyholos, dumbfounded by Trou's moxie, said sometimes absurd leads do result in useful information and that we must all do our part to defend Elysea.</p>
