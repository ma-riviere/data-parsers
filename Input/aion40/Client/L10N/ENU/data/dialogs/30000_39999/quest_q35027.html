        	<p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to the grace of Lord Kaisinel and the efforts of countless Daevas, we have successfully begun to move in Inggison. Our next step is to build an Aetheric Field Observatory there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of our members are already searching for possible sites for the observatory, and we need to gather their reports.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please check in with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Keios] at the Altar of Avarice to get his update, which you should then pass on to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>

          <p>Arieluma, comrade!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Quietly now. I have been surveying as ordered, and now know this isn't the place to build the Observatory. We're too far out from Illusion Fortress, there's not enough Aether, and the attacks are too frequent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell them that we must control Silentera Canyon and even beyond the bulwark, if we wish to build an Observatory at the Altar of Avarice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful when you leave. Our enemies often lurk in the darkness, seeking to retake the Altar.</p>

          <p>So disappointing. But the Altar of Avarice sits in the middle of a war on two fronts, so it can't be an ideal place for the Aetheric Field Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your efforts. I'll report your findings to the top.</p>
