          <p>[%username]! By Azphel's wings, is that a Siel's Supreme Polearm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've only seen a handful of those...and most were broken beyond repair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can I take a closer look?</p>

          <p>Blast...this polearm is busted as well. It's lost a lot of power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shaft is bent, the point is dull, and...what's this? It looks like something has been gnawing on the handle! Look at the teeth marks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, no matter--the good news is I think it can be repaired. Want to know how?</p>

          <p>I wish I could help you myself, but I don't have any kind of blacksmithing skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan] does. He's a Kobold, and the best blacksmith in Gelkmaros...maybe even Atreia. I know, I had my doubts at first too, but he has a gift. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find him in the Rhonnam Refugee Village. He might be the best blacksmith in all Atreia, but he's also the worst cook. Whatever you do, don't let him serve you...anything.</p>

          <p>Your [%mainslotitem] wouldn't hold a candle to the Siel's Supreme Polearm if it were repaired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's just my opinion. You do what you want.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Is delicious dish! Does not contain Human or cause vomiting. This is rumor, Tataka promises.</p>

          <p>Wait moment...that not regular polearm. Tataka take closer look....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Egads, Daeva! This is Siel's Supreme Polearm! Rare opportunity to work on this kind weapon. Would be Tataka's honor to repair polearm for Daeva. </p>
