          <p>My coworkers and I entered the Abyssal Splinter without telling Branch Manager Jarumonerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We heard there was some amazing treasure inside, but it was more dangerous than we thought. Balaur and some shiny things chased me. I thought I was going to die, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of us managed to escape, but many did not. Please rescue them before it is too late.</p>

          <p>Thank you, kind Daeva.</p>

          <p>My coworkers are trapped in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_SZ_C]. They ducked into an empty space to avoid the Balaur, but a crystal blocked the entrance and they couldn't get out. Nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please go save at least one of them, nyerk. And keep it secret from the Traders. If Branch Manager Jarumonerk finds out, it will only make things worse.</p>
