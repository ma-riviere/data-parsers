          <p>I'm glad you're here, [%username]. There are problems with the Abyssal Splinter.</p>

          <p>My superiors are pressuring me to solve it, so I don't think I can wait till the situation runs its course.</p>

          <p>That's why I need you.</p>

          <p>The investigators are having a hard time going deeper into the Abyssal Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Going to Pazuzu's Sanctuary is no longer a problem, but they can't get by the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_SZ_C] because of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Agrint_Kn_55_Ah]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe they'll get better at dealing with problems like this as time passes, but for now there's no time to spare. Can you please help us, [%username]? </p>

          <p>As I said earlier, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Agrint_Kn_55_Ah]s protect the Storm Cave. If you can get rid of them, the investigators will be able to explore the deepest parts of the Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I might also mention that since Pandaemonium has taken an interest, the reward for completing this task is quite good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But obviously that's a secondary motivation for you, right?</p>
