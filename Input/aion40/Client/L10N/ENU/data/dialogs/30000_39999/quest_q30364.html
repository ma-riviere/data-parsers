          <p>This is amazing! I've seen very few necklaces this sophisticated. This is masterful work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See here? Can you see this joint? The technique used to make it is from before the Cataclysm!</p>

          <p>I can't say. Why don't you ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sif], the Preceptor of Sorcerers and Spiritmasters?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If a spirit dropped it, there's a good chance that Sif probably knows why.</p>

          <p>She might even know who the proper owner is. I doubt very much that it was the spirit--they're not known to own jewelry!</p>

          <p>I.... Let me explain: Pazuzu is a Tempest Spirit that I summoned long ago. Pazuzu and I were always together...even on the day of the Cataclysm. This necklace was a special gift I made for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Tower shattered and Atreia split, Pazuzu and I were...separated. I kept trying to summon her but she never came back. Never.... I assumed she was...gone forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now it seems you've found her, inside this Abyssal Splinter. If she kept this necklace, it must mean that she still remembers me. With this, I think I can summon her again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have no idea how grateful I am. Thank you so much, [%username].</p>

          <p>Pazuzu, the Current of Life, dropped a jewelry box when she disappeared. You found an extraordinary necklace inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took it to Handicrafting Master Lanse, who said it was made before the Cataclysm. For further details, she sent you to ask Sif, a Preceptor of Spiritmasters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You showed the necklace to Sif, who immediately recognized it. She said Pazuzu is a spirit she summoned long ago, and was overjoyed at the news that Pazuzu might be resummoned.</p>
