          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_S5] is becoming quite the headache, [%username]. The entrance is so narrow that they can effectively defend the entire base with a fraction of the soldiers that we have to deploy.</p>
          <p> </p>
	  			<p>We need your help. The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30716a]s won't be expecting an elite [%userclass] like you. Smash through their defenses, and help us end this bloody war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're finished, return to Tiamaranta and report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erephe].</p>

          <p>Defeated?? Excellent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the way is clear for our troops to take the Headquarters. It's a key strategic location that should make the rest of our assaults much easier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have saved a great many lives, friend. Thank you for all that you've done!</p>

          <p>Ariana told you how the Tahabata Legion HQ was extremely well defended, causing the Elyos assault to stall. You offered to help, and wiped out the Balaur forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On your return, Erephe thanked you for your work, and told you that the war should be a little smoother now.</p>
