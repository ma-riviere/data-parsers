          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your vigorous efforts, we have been successful in promoting the well-being of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To build on this success, the Alabaster Order has commissioned Walking Encyclopedia Fuchsia to invent a device called the Chasing Eye. The Eye activates when a non-Elyos passes by, and then it records the features of the suspicious trespasser.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to retrieve the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35007]'s memory records and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion calls us to act swiftly!</p>

          <p>I'm sure the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35007] instructs you to retrieve the Chasing Eye's memory records of suspicious trespassers.</p>

          <p>Let's see what the Eye has discovered. Maybe we'll have caught some real Asmodians!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can just make out.... This fuzzy picture looks like it might be a being with wings of blackest shadow. What do you think?</p>

          <p>I must show this to Typhon immediately. Good work, [%username].</p>
