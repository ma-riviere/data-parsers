          <p>Yes. Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_FanaticQ30114_54_Ae]. She can be found in Lower Udas Temple.</p>

          <p>I see. It...it was a good death. Worthy.</p>

          <p>I-I'm afraid I've been less than forthcoming with you. The Dragonbound you just slew...was my daughter.</p>

          <p>I knew from the start that she'd been taken, not killed. But I couldn't bear to tell anyone else. My Aluti...the future of the Reian tribe....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With her intelligence and strength, she would have made the Dragonbound nearly unstoppable. I couldn't let her do that. She wouldn't have wanted it.</p>

          <p>Thank you for releasing her. Now she can rest...and so can I.</p>
