          <p>Vergelan just doesn't get it. [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDUnderpassRe_SZ] is a major threat to all of the Asmodians here. Not just from Laksyaka's troops--imagine if the Elyos got their hands on that supply of weapons and relics!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got to capture or destroy that cache before it can be used against us, by anyone! Vergelan may have his hands full, but maybe you can help?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I need you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDUnderpassRe_SZ] and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30062all]?</p>

          <p>I knew you'd live up to your reputation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you again. I'll inform Vergelan that The Hexway will not be a problem anymore. With a bit of luck, he'll be happy enough with that, and I won't be reprimanded for taking initiave on something.</p>

          <p>Arne was worried that Vergelan underestimated the situation at The Hexway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Arne said that the risk of Laksyaka's stored gear falling into enemy hands was too great, and asked you to eliminate the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned with your friends from killing Laksyaka's Underlings, Arne told you that she'd report to Laksyaka.</p>
