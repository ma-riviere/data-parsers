          <p>Something has been weighing on my mind lately...[%username], is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nearby is an abandoned Balaur temple--it's called Udas Temple, I believe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This temple was abandoned long ago, but the Dragonbound recently took it over. Now they are expanding their influence beyond the temple grounds.</p>

          <p>I want you to find out what this group wants with Udas Temple. They must have a reason....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There may be another way to uncover the truth, but I don't know of anything that will work except the direct approach. By which I mean striking them down and searching for clues.</p>

          <p>It's dangerous to go alone. Take this advice: before you enter the temple, first find out what you can outside of it in Subterranea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is filled with Fighters, Guards, Raiders, and Sentinels who will not be pleased to see you. Undoubtedly there will be dark Sorcerers, Spiritmasters, Healers, and Monks as well. Any of them might carry a clue to their purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful, Daeva. None of these beings are in their right mind. They are insane, completely brainwashed by the Balaur. Even for you, they will not be easy to contend with.</p>
