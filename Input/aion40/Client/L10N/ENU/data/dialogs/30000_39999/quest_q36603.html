	  <p>Greetings, [%username]. Judging from the scars on you, I'm going to say you're some kind of [%userclass], right?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I hold the chests for [%userclass]s. We like to reward our best fortune hunters by offering these Fortuneers' Chests for all their hard work.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>You have to give me the tokens you received from your daily quests, of course. How many tokens are you up to these days?</p>

		<p>With 10 Fortuneers Tokens, you may indeed lay claim to a Fortuneers' Chest.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>With 20 or even 40 tokens, an even grander chest would await you. A fortune hunter with some amount of patience would choose to wait, but you Fortuneers recognize that life is fleeting. Live for today, right?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>So, we have a deal? Just hand over your Fortuneers Tokens and we'll get things in order.</p>

		<p>Say, you look pretty good for surviving 20 quests! Why don't you take one of these chests off my hands? You've earned it.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Just put the 20 Fortuneers Tokens in my hand, and this lovely chest of riches could be yours!</p>

		<p>We have a special chest of riches for those Fortuneers who have been with our legion for 40 days. I don't know what's in there, but I'm sure it'll serve you well.</p>

		<p>Interested? Just give me the 40 tokens and the chest is yours.</p>
