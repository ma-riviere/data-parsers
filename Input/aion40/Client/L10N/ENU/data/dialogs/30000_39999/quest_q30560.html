          <p>You know, now that I hold my father's insignia in my hand like this, I think perhaps my sister, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Danell], could benefit from the connection to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My mother says she's just going through a phase because of Father's death. But this "phase" has been going on for years now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has a... unique attitude towards life these days. Very grim, very dark. Not depressed, exactly, but... well, you'll see once you meet her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you take the insignia to her? Remind her of happier times?</p>

          <p>"The skies rain. Rain with the tears of blood that drip drip drip from my soul..."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's a line from my latest poem. It reflects the inky despair that permeates my very being.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why do you approach me, Danell, Mistress of Ennui?</p>

          <p>This is... this is Father's. But I thought he gave it to Wurus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was always a cheerful man. He used to give me rides on his back and tell me how beautiful life is...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well. Not that this makes any difference to the Countess of Cruelty, but I'll keep it--perhaps look at it once in a while.</p>

          <p>Wurus thinks his sister Danell, who is very dark and broody, could use their father's keepsake more than he does.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You delivered the keepsake to Danell. You thought that her angst brightened just a little upon seeing it.</p>
