          <p>No...it couldn't be. Is that...a Siel's Supreme Staff?</p>

          <p>By Azphel's wings, where did you get that, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Hmmmm...that's too bad. It looks like the staff is damaged.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The entire shaft is cracked, the base is chipped, and...what's this? There's dried blood caked all over the head! I hope some [%userclass] wasn't swinging this around in desperation....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I think it can be repaired. I can't do it, but I know some...thing that can. Do you want to give it a try, [%username]?</p>

          <p>The blacksmith I know might be the best in all Atreia, and I suppose I should be glad that he's on our side. But the thing is...he's a Kobold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His smithing skill is without equal, and he's a civil fellow...but I still get the feeling he hasn't completely forsaken his Kobold heritage. You know that whole..."cook your foes and eat them" thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan], and you can find him in Rhonnam Refugee Village. Just be wary if he starts talking about cooking....</p>
