          <p>Can you imagine sending legions of infinitely repairable, reproducable golems against the Balaur? Now imagine that same force against us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is why the Elders have determined that we must reclaim Argent Manor from the Balaur completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you wish to aid us, start with destroying [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Ranger_60_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Melee_60_Ah]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just remember, they were made by one of the most talented golem fashioners alive. They won't be easy to deal with.</p>

          <p>From what I've been told, Argent Manor still contains most of Davlin's notes and prototypes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recovering them would be much easier without those golems in the way. Can I tell my superiors it's safe to go in?</p>

          <p>Very good. I'll send the message at once. Hopefully, we can reconstruct Davlin's work from what we find.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't tell how many golems Zadra managed to turn, or build himself. More may pop up before we're done in there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, every little bit helps. Both Asmodians and Reians should be proud of you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Reddis was concerned that Davlin's Hetgolems, turned by Zadra, could hamper efforts to recover her work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus you went to Argent Manor and destroyed Loyal Hetgolems and Melee Hetgolems. Your accomplishment was well rewarded.</p>
