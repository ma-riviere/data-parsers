          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We live in a time of war. The Elyos, the Balaur, the Asmodians, the Empyrean Lords--all are fighting, all are too busy to count the costs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we, the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, must take it upon ourselves to make life-giving potions and secret remedies that we will then donate to the Inggison Illusion Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need your help! Only with everyone's efforts can we pull together to save our people, our culture, and our blessed way of life. Gather [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35048], a major ingredient, and bring it to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021]. Move quickly! Lives and outposts are at stake!</p>

          <p>Mmmmm. Whenever I smell Zeldt, it reminds me of a tender roast, turning on the spit. The meat breaks off easily onto my plate and melts on my tongue with the most delicious....</p>
