          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something unthinkable has happened. A group of Lepharist Revolutionaries attacked one of our high-ranking Daevas and stole a confidential document.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, the stolen document is protected by a spell that causes an explosion should an unauthorized person attempt to break its seal...and now we hear reports of a mysterious explosion on one of Heiron's main roads.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, [%username], member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to search the main roads of Heiron for any [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35008] and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make haste, for the contents of this document must remain concealed from those who would harm Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the good of all Elyos!</p>

          <p>A call to action from the Alabaster Order said a group of Lepharist Revolutionaries attacked a high-ranking Daeva and stole a confidential document.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This document was spelled to explode if an unauthorized person attempted to open it. As chance would have it, an unidentified explosion occurred recently on one of Heiron's main roads.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The letter contained orders to search Heiron for the Confidential Document Scraps, which you then returned to Aiskyholos for a reward. </p>
