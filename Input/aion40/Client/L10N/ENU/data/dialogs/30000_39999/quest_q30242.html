          <p>It looks as if your Noble Siel's Supreme Dagger been plunged into the chests of too many Asmodian breastplates, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can enhance it, if you like? Upgrade it to Siel's Dominant Dagger, which would behoove a [%userclass] in your line of work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask not for Kinah or gold. I only ask that you sever the throats of as many Balaur with it as you can!</p>

          <p>That is why I propose this, [%username]. We share one overriding goal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to obtain the materials and forge them, but that shouldn't be too difficult for you. I know what you are capable of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shall we proceed?</p>

        <body>
          <p>As I said, I will need a few items to begin--Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>
