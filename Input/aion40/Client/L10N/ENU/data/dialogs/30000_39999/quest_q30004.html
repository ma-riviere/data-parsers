          <p>Based on your report and Honeus's counsel, I believe cutting off the enemy's head is the best solution. The Dragonbound are completely brainwashed automatons controlled entirely by a puppet master.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you go to the Chamber of Guidance and eliminate [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_FanaticFiNamed_53_Ah], causing chaos to reign?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd do it myself, but I feel sick.</p>
