          <p>I knew I could rely on you. If you couldn't give your oath without knowing the details of what I'm asking, I would have had to question your loyalty.</p>

          <p>I need you to keep Stormwing's location a closely guarded secret. He is powerful, and angry, and he must not be released from his prison, no matter what.</p>

          <p>I've heard whisperings among some Daevas that we could use such a powerful creature, unleash it upon Tiamat.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. Eventually, this news will get out, but at least this gives us time to think of an more permanent solution to the Stormwing problem.</p>
