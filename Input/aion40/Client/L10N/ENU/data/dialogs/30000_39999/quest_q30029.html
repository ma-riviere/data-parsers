          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I was just admiring that weapon on your hip there. That wouldn't be Siel's Supreme Dagger, would it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have to be either a skilled [%userclass] or a crazy [%userclass] to carry that thing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that is the dagger I think it is, I don't even want to guess how you got it. It's rarer than one of Lania's Kerubar steaks!</p>

          <p>You've done a real number on it, Daeva. Or did you find it that way? Eh, regardless, the blasted thing should be in a museum, not a battlefield!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back in its prime, the Siel's Supreme Dagger could have sliced through any armor imagineable...sever a boulder with one strike. But this old beaten thing here couldn't cut meat for my sandwich.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I know a good Reian that could fix it up for you...make it as strong as it was the day it was first forged. He doesn't deal in Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors.</p>

          <p>I just don't like to see a beautiful dagger like that in the condition it's in, [%username]. After all, a weapon that can't unleash its full potential is like a rainbow with six variations of tan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reian I know is in Soteria Sanctuary...goes by the name [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios]...or something close to that effect. You know how confusing those Reian names are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, head out there and he should be able to help you out. Tell him I sent you.</p>

          <p>This was the weapon of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! I haven't seen one like this since I was a child!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's seen better battles, though. I'm surprised this thing can cut wind in its current state. Let's see what I can do....</p>
