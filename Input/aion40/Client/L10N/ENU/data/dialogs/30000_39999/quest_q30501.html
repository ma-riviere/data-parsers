          <p>The Vasharti Legion struck Rentus without warning, and we fell quickly. Too quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our cloaking spells should have kept us hidden, but they not only found us, they also struck directly at our nerve centers. As much as I hate to contemplate it, someone within Rentus must have been working with the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll keep an eye on my fellow refugees if you'll find out what's happening in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our last contact came from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ariana], a top lieutenant serving under Merops before the Balaur invaded. Siel willing, she's still alive.</p>

          <p>Y-you? You're my reinforcements? I've been expecting other Reians to come to my aid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, help is help. I won't reject that which I so desperately need. Welcome to Rentus Base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would say to make yourself comfortable, but this is about as comfortable as it gets here, at the moment.</p>

          <p>Most likely much more dire than you were led to believe. You see, I know how the Balaur got past our defenses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Warden Merops, head of Rentus Base--he betrayed us to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He opened an Abyss Gate, and the Balaur just marched right in. Oh, Siel, why? Why did he do that?!</p>

          <p>Oreitia sent you almost at once to Rentus Base to provide reinforcement and to scout out the situation.</p>

          <p>You went there and met Ariana, who told you the grim news about how the Balaur took over so easily.</p>
