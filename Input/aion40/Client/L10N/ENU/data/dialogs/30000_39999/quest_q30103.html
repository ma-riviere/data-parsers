          <p>I acknowledge your continued assistance, Asmodian, but let me be blunt: I know that what the enemy is hiding in that temple is probably more important to you than it is to us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We only wish to defeat the Balaur and their Followers so we may live in peace, whereas you want to conquer the whole of Gelkmaros.</p>

          <p>I appreciate your honesty, Daeva. Yet despite your people's long term agenda, we must cooperate in the short term to defeat the Dragonbound.</p>

          <p>I fear you will find nothing more of use outside of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_DF4]. You must go inside and find out what the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_SensoryArea_Q30003] is.</p>

          <p>You will need to again pass through Subterranea to reach the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_DF4]. Once inside...I wish I could tell you exactly where to go and what to do, but Udas Temple is completely foreign to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One thing is certain, however--their leader will be inside. Defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_FanaticFiNamed_53_Ah], and you might find a helpful clue to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_SensoryArea_Q30003].</p>

          <p>Afraid, are you? It's only natural--determination alone isn't enough for anyone to venture into Balaur territory, to a place overrun by Dragonbound. I won't hold it against you.</p>

          <p>Too bad.... I desperately wanted to collaborate with the Asmodians and eradicate the Dragonbound. Perhaps I'll find another....</p>

          <p>Hmmmm.... The enemy's motives elude us once again, but you've done well. Now we know that our search must include the Lower Udas Temple. The gate to that area will indeed open with the key you bear, but only if it is properly attuned...here, let me....</p>

          <p>There. The key is attuned to your energy. It has accepted you, and so the gate to the Lower Udas Temple will open.</p>
