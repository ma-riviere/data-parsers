          <p>Have you ever heard of Hanarkand--the Drakan village?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reports of suspicious activities have been trickling in from that region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have final confirmation, but it looks like the Dragonbound are transporting something from the village to Angrief Ruins.</p>

          <p>I don't know what or why, but they're hauling something, and that can't be good. We need to find out what they're up to.</p>

          <p>Can you go check it out? We need to see what's going on, but keep it on the QT until we find out what we're dealing with. It's always best to plan from a position of knowledge.</p>
