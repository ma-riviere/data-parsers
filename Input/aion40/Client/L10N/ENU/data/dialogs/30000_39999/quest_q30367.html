          <p>You've been inside the Abyssal Splinter a lot, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So by now you would have noticed huge fragments of Aether inside, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of the reports from the investigators inside mention something like that.</p>

          <p>Well...I think these [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAbRe_Core_ArtifactCore]s are probably worth a closer look.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See this report? Powerful creatures are guarding these fragments. There must be a reason why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume it's because they're important for maintaining the Abyssal Splinter. Care to help see if my assumption is right, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Get rid of these Protectors, and destroy the Huge Fragments of Aether they're guarding. Watch closely and see what happens when you do this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and don't worry--doing so shouldn't do anything serious like destabilize the Abyssal Splinter. At least, I'm pretty sure it won't....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, stay alert.... It might get dangerous in there.</p>

          <p>A scream of rage from deep inside the Abyssal Splinter? Interesting, and unexpected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I theorize that if you destroy Huge Aether Fragments, it angers the Artifact Protectors quite a lot. That part's not really unexpected, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will be interesting fighting furious Protectors, but now is not the time. The Elyos and Balaur are also after the Artifact, so I think it would be better to leave the fragments alone for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good investigative work, [%username]. Here's the reward I promised.</p>

          <p>Gwal was curious what role the Huge Aether Fragments in the Abyssal Splinter play. He asked you to destroy them to see what happens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you destroyed them, you heard a scream of rage from deep inside the Abyssal Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gwal said that based on your report, it's probably a good idea to leave the Huge Aether Fragments alone for the time being, so as to capture the Artifact more easily.</p>
