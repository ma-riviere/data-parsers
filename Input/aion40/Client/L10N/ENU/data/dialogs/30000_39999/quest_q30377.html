          <p>I should probably explain a little about what's going on. The Aether flow around the Abyssal Splinter has gotten increasingly unstable, and caused a new splinter to appear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creatures inside are even more dangerous than before, and present a major threat to us all should they somehow escape this new splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first thing we need you to do is kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Octaside_Kn_60_Al]. If you thought Kaluva the Fourth Fragment was hostile, well, let's just say this Arachna makes that one look like a Shugo pet. You may want to gather some allies for this fight.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your efforts. Just the thought of that giant spider skittering around here was enough to give me nightmares. There's a lot more to do inside the Unstable Abyssal Splinter, but this is a good start. I hope I'll see you again soon.</p>

          <p>Gwal said that the Aether flow around the Abyssal Splinter has become unstable, causing an Unstable Abyssal Splinter to be created. The creatures inside are even more dangerous than those in the Abyssal Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>You killed Kaluva and returned to Gwal. Gwal thanked you and asked you to help purge the rest of the creatures inside the Unstable Abyssal Splinter.</p>
