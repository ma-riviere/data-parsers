          <p>What with all the Asmodians lurking in the Canyon, I'm beginning to think we'll never get to these [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30052a] before they do!</p>

          <p>Yes.... Maybe I should start at the beginning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, there's a theory that parts of Silentera Canyon used to be a Jotun structure before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A studio, specifically, where the Jotun tended the giant weapons we're calling Petraliths...</p>

          <p>They might be. Not all of them of course, but we'll never know if the Asmodians get to them first.</p>

          <p>Oh, and when you're done, you can take them to Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gellius]. He'll figure out which ones are related to the Petraliths.</p>
