	  			<p>I ah... say, Daeva. That's a fine outfit that you have there. Very fitting... really sets you apart from the other flesh-faces! Yes! Hehe...</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>So, now that we have become life-partners, or whatever weak term you soft-skins use, perhaps you can cement your blood with mine in a partner pact, yes? You know, us Balaur warriors take on difficult tasks as signs of our friendship dedication quantity. Yes...</p>
