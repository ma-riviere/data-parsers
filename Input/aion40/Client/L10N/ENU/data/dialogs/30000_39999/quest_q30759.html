          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dragan] can't join in the attack on the stronghold, and has asked me for help.</p>

          <p>Not that I have time for his little reconniassance questions either, but perhaps you might?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He wants to know if the number of stone statues in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_S6] is increasing. Don't ask me why. I don't even know where the garden is.</p>

          <p>How terrible! That confirms all my--Oh, maybe I should explain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragon Lords have the gruesome habit of turning their victims to stone. If the statue count is increasing, that can only mean one thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been searching for Hakelan for a while too. Do you think it's possible that he's one of the statues in that room?</p>

          <p>Ariana said Dragan had a favor to ask. She asked you to find the Noble Garden and count how many stone statues were in it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you found the garden, you confirmed there were more stone statues than Ariana had reported. Dragan was very upset at this news.</p>
