          <p>I need you to spearhead an assualt on [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun]. It's a Reian outpost in Tiamaranta that we'd hoped to use as a staging area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur somehow discovered it, and we don't need those resources in their claws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While the Reians have not formally requested our assistance, this is the time to prove that Asmodae will be a staunch ally. Do whatever [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Maios], a Reian Elder, asks of you.</p>

          <p>Aren't you the one they call [%username]? We are all greatful that you have done so much for my people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, here's what I know about Rentus Base: the Balaur who invaded belong to the Vasharti Legion. The attack was sudden and vicious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oreitia is one of the fortunates who escaped. She can tell you more.</p>

          <p>I don't think I've heard of you, but I trust my Elders' judgment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This would be one of the possibly worst times for our allies to fail us.</p>

          <p>I hope so. I truly do.</p>

          <p>But on to the situation at Rentus: I won't lie to you. It's grim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our forces took a huge beating in the surprise attack. Many of our comrades are missing or dead.</p>
