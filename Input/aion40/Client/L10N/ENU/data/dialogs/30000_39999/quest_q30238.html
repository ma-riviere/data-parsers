          <p>It looks as if your Noble Siel's Supreme Staff has seen a dozen more battles than it should have, my Elyos friend...a brutally long dozen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps upgrading to Siel's Dominant Staff would benefit a [%userclass] in your line of work.</p>

          <p>I had hoped you would be, Daeva. If you like, I can explain the process right now.</p>

          <p>You'll have to provide the muscle and legwork, but that shouldn't be too difficult for you, [%username].</p>

          <p>I will need a few items to begin. You'll need to obtain Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>Daeva, I know you are eager to upgrade your weapon, but the swallow only follows the sip. You cannot bypass a step and hope for the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] before going to the Jotun Studio to make the essence.</p>
