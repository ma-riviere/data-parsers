          <p>This is an urgent request from Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Temenos], an Alabaster Order undercover operative. He needs someone discreet to carry some information that is too important to write down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_Underpass] to infiltrate Gelkmaros and search for Centurion Temenos who is currently on a mission to capture the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3021_A] there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], move quickly and bring his message back to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>

          <p>This must be big. I don't even know one of those codes, and supposedly I know them all. I've got to talk with Alabaster Order President Typhon about this.</p>
