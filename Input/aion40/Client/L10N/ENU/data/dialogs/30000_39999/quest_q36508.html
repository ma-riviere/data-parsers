          <p> </p>
          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Trickster is wanted for the charges described herein:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_FanaticCh_54_An]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: Attempted Murder of Elyos by Way of Traps</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: Infamous for his brutal and barbarous snares and traps, the Trickster injured several Elyos Guardians as they traveled the path to Undirborg. He evaded capture by entering the Undirborg--his last known location. Be aware--The Trickster is know to use Windstreams to move about at great speed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyone who apprehends or assassinates the Trickster will be handsomely rewarded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>You aren't here to collect on the Trickster, are you? Faith and arms, you have a knack for this line of work! I've heard nothing but sad tales and so-close stories from the other Fortuneers.</p>

          <p>Those roadside traps the Trickster made, they were almost exact replicas of the devices the Ancient Atreians used to maim the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Curse the darkness! Using a trap made for beasts to hurt us Elyos! Well, as long as the Fortuneers exist, and as long as clients keep paying well, the crooked and deplorable of this world will have no place to hide!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take your reward and leave me. I have things to ponder now.</p>
