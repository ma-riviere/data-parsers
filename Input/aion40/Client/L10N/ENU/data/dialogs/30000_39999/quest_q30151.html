          <p>Ah, [%username]. I was just thinking about how we could demoralize the Elyos...and by Azphel's wings, here's the solution!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The situation in Silentera Canyon isn't improving. It takes five of those gutless Elyos to fight off one Asmodian, but they have the superior numbers at the moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The cowards have been targeting our less experienced Daevas, but if a Daeva like you were to appear in Silentera Canyon, I'm sure the Elyos would have their hands full.</p>

          <p>Hehehe, well, just get to Silentera Canyon and start spilling blood, more or less.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make sure you target their veterans, Daevas who are just as strong and experienced as you are; that'll throw them off balance and make the weaker ones easier to pick off later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And don't worry. I know there are too many in Silentera Canyon for you to handle by yourself, so I'll be sending others in your wake. </p>

          <p>Excellent! Remember that we need to go after the strongest Elyos Daevas, those with power that rivals your own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I won't tell you to resist stomping on the weaker Daevas.... I know I couldn't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can drive out the Elyos, we'll be one step closer to launching a full scale invasion into Inggison. Go now and slaughter the Elyos. Blood for blood!</p>

          <p>This is disappointing, [%username].</p>

          <p>Of all our Daevas, I thought you would be the most eager to spill some Elyos blood.</p>

          <p>I guess the rumors about you are false....</p>

          <p>But still, vanquishing the weaker Daevas before they even realize what's happening...those are priceless memories. Now then, report in!</p>

          <p>Hahaha! I'm sure Elyos morale snapped like a twig with you on the battlefield. Even the strongest Elyos Daevas are no match for an Asmodian of your ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we still have a lot of ground to cover, despite your contributions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if we can keep this kind of pressure on the Elyos, I have no doubt that we'll be launching a full scale invasion into Inggison in no time. </p>
