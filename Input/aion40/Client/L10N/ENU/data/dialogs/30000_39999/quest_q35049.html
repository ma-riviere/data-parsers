          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Phanoe Gate is the Inggison Illusion Fortress's first line of defense. Losing it to our enemies would trap us inside, and give them leverage to breach the next fortress gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we hear that our Guardians at Phanoe Gate are crippled. Apparently the Bluetail Crestlichs are so noisy that a stealthy Balaur might go unheard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call upon you--and all of the Alabaster Order--to get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Crestlich_Head_51_n]s that distract our Guardians, and report to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021] as soon as the mission is complete. Move quickly, lest Phanoe Gate fall!</p>

          <p>I feel kinda sorry for Bluetail Crestlichs, but we had to do it...for the safety of the Inggison Illusion Fortress.</p>
