		<p>How marvelous that you've brought twelve Progress Tokens!</p>

		<p>The Alabaster Order, and our perfect President Typhon, are glad to hear it. But, you need to ask yourself whether you should accept this sun-blessed reward or wait until you've acquired twenty-eight or even sixty Tokens. The rewards at those levels are...well...words fail to express it.</p>

		<p>Why don't you check your cube and then come back with the right amount?</p>
