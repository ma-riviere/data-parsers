          <p>Now that Kaluva and its webs are gone, we can turn our attention to the Crystal Mezzanine. A scout reported spotting an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_FiNmd_Combine] there, which would present a major problem for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The worst of it is that an Unstable Dayshade can split itself into two parts, one [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Guardian_Light_Fi_60_Al] and one [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Guardian_Dark_Fi_60_Al]. You have to defeat them both.</p>

          <p>When you fight them, they build a shield. The Unstable Rukril makes an Unstable Piece of Splendor, and the Unstable Ebonsoul makes an Unstable Piece of Midnight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Unstable Piece of Midnight to the Unstable Rukril to disapate its shield, and do the same with the Unstable Piece of Splendor and the Unstable Ebonsoul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most importantly, once their shields are down, you need to try and kill them almost simultaneously. Whichever one you kill first, the other will become more aggressive and difficult to fight.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I'm sure it was a very difficult battle, but you managed to take care of the problem quite quickly. Once my scouts come back, we should be ready to enter the center of the debris.</p>
