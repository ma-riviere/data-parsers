          <p>By Aion's grace...is that...is that a Siel's Supreme Spellbook?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where ever did you find this, [%username]? These relics are exceptionally rare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most were weapons used by Daevas of Lady Siel's Spear Legion, and passed down through generations of the Reian tribe.</p>

          <p>Do you mind if I take a closer look? Oh no...this spellbook has fallen into disrepair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The cover is all tattered, the spine is falling apart, and...what's this? Did...did something take a bite out of this corner, like it was a blasted sandwich?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It must have quite a history, not all good. Luckily, I know some...thing that can repair it. Would you like me to help?</p>

          <p>Hahaha, well of course, I didn't mean that I would repair it! I don't have any such skills--I wouldn't even know where to begin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But a Kobold named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan] of Rhonnam Refugee Village can help. Don't get me wrong, he's a fantastic blacksmith, but I always feel like he's sizing me up to stuff me in a stew pot...or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, just take the spellbook to him, and I'm sure he'll be happy to repair it. Just don't get him started on cooking, and whatever you do, do not try the dumplings!</p>

          <p>It just feels like a waste to not repair that spellbook.</p>

          <p>Now, let Tataka take closer look at spellbook. This is...this is Siel's Supreme Spellbook!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does Daeva understand what rare thing this is? Tataka seen very few relics like this, just know from legends. Tataka would be most honored to repair it for Daeva.</p>
