        <body>
          <p>I have been fully briefed about Elementis Forest. With what's happened, all Reians are being called to muster their power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been ordered to target the corrupted golems. Have you ever heard of the Luminous Sapling?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's extremely tall already, which should tell you something about what it'll one day become. Its sap contains the concentrated power of Elementis Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to ask you to destroy any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Farmer_60_Ah]s you find collecting the sap in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDElemental_1]. It should slow the Balaur's plans for a while.</p>

          <p>We're sending as many troops as we can into Elementis Forest to deal with the Balaur forces there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an amazing place, full of energy. Something like that shouldn't stay in their hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did the Seed Hetgolems give you trouble?</p>

          <p>Then the Luminous Sapling is safe, at least for now. That will be a great relief to the Elders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Balaur are tenacious. You might need to clear them out again later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few more victories like this, and their fear will hopefully reach all the way up to Tiamat. Good work.</p>
