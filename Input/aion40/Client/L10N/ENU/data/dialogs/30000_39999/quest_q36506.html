          <p>Where could he have moved those supplies to? I'm half-tempted to search your dwellings...but I trust you, [%username]. You're a good Fortuneer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's peculiar, they say no weapons were taken. Who would simply steal supplies when they could lay their hands on a whole cache of axes and swords? Eh, maybe the soldiers just don't want to admit it. Don't want to put the fear of darkness in the Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, here's your reward. You're making us and yourself quite rich with your adventures in the fortune-hunting trade.</p>
