          <p>What, Daeva not satisfied with Noble Siel's Supreme Dagger?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tataka understands. He's always seeking to make cooking better. Just yesterday learned difference between salt and sugar!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very proud moment for Tataka! Oh, want to try new dish? It has stopped breathing now....</p>

          <p>Dagger? Oh, yes, dagger!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, Noble Siel's Supreme Dagger can be improved. But Daeva must get rare materials, forge them together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will be very difficult even for strong Daeva. Sure you want to try?</p>

          <p>Okay, then go to Beshmundir Temple. Sealed Balaur there has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shulack captured by Nightshadow Clan has [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a]. Finally, need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]. Shulacks have that--it is very rare!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have them all, go to Debilkarim's Forge furnace and forge together to make Essence of Siel crystal. Bring back, and Tataka will cook up dagger for you!</p>
