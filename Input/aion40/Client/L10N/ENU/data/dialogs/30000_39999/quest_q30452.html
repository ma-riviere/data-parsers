          <p>With the power of the Magic Stone, you should be able to simply walk through the barrier at Argent Manor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But your task will not be as easy as that sounds. Davlin is VERY good at making golems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gortea]'s laboratory is on the second floor. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Nmd_Wizard_60_Al] is most likely to be there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have no idea of Zadra's capabilities. But to have overwhelmed Davlin's golems indicates great power. You must defeat him quickly and decisively. Are you up to the task?</p>

          <p>You... you're one of those Asmodians! Then [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raues] sent you, didn't he?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To have revealed the existence of this place to outsiders! He must have been very concerned for my well-being.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry. I can make it back on my own. I just need to bring a few of my golems back to their true loyalty.</p>

          <p>Excellent! Now that Davlin is safe, the veil of secrecy can relax a little. Hopefully that will help us reclaim what the Balaur took.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only Davlin had returned with you! She has always been somewhat reckless. Hopefully this time nothing will go wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your success will benefit your people, in many ways. Please take this with the deepest of gratitude.</p>
