          <p>[%username], I should probably explain a little about what's happened. The Aether flow around the Abyssal Splinter has destabilized, causing a new splinter to appear. This new one is dangerously unstable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What this means is that the creatures inside are both more powerful and more dangerous than the ones associated with a normal Abyssal Splinter. We need you and your allies to get in there and take care of this before it gets any worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Start by killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Octaside_Kn_60_Al]. Giant Arachnas are bad enough, but a giant, insane Arachna boosted by an Aether flow? That's a problem that even a knuckle-dragger can see.</p>

          <p>Back in one piece, I see. Were you able to kill Unstable Kaluva the Fourth?</p>

          <p>You make it sound so easy. I'm sure all that Aetheric energy had made it much stronger than the other one, but you killed it anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well done. Don't relax too much, though. There's a lot of creatures still in the Unstable Abyssal Splinter that need to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk to me again when you're ready for more.</p>

          <p>Aratus said that a destabilized Aether flow around the Abyssal Splinter has created an Unstable Abyssal Splinter with more powerful creatures inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked you to kill the monsters inside the splinter, starting with Kaluva the giant spider.</p>
