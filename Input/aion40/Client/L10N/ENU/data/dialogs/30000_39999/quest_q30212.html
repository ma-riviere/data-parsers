          <p>I've been rereading my notes, [%username], and I think the reason why the Quartz Rod didn't work was because it didn't have enough energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the Quartz Rod powers the Rift Orb, so, obviously, it won't work if it doesn't have enough energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to replenish the Rod's energy and it should power up the orb. Now we just need to figure out what kind of energy it uses.</p>

          <p>That's exactly what I was thinking. The Balaur made it, so it must be something they would use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surkana Fragments, perhaps. They would have used it back in the day when the document was first written...still use it to this day, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you get some, [%username]? This might be the last piece of the puzzle.</p>

          <p>From my research, I know that the Balaur use Gathering Worms to harvest Dranas. And these worms have Surkana in their flesh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're all over Mephistis Farm, Angrief Wastes and Hanarkand Plains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B4_Spaller_mini_54_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Spaller_mini_55_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C2_Spaller_mini_55_An]s, and you should come up with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30212a]s.</p>
