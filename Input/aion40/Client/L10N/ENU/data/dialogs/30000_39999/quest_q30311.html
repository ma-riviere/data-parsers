          <p>Very interesting.... The document doesn't give a specific location for Stormwing's prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead, it describes how to get there from Beshmundir Temple.</p>

          <p>Apparently, there is a large orb in the Ritual Chamber where you fought Isbariya the Resolute. It is a teleporter that takes you to the Prison of Ice, where Stormwing is imprisoned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it seems this is no ordinary teleporter. It requires a specific energy source to function.</p>

          <p>Oh, no, nothing so prosaic. It's the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30211a], found in a place called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCatacombs_SZ_C].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a secret door to it before the Hero's Vault, wherever that is. But you've been to Beshmundir, so surely you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are the only one I know with a chance of finding that Rod and activating the teleporter. Can you do it?</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30211a] was apparently given to a creature called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCatacombsN_ShadowStalker_55_Ah] for safekeeping. You'll need to defeat it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you have the Rod, take it to the Ritual Chamber in the Temple of Eternity and activate the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDCatacombs_BigOrb_Q30211].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's dangerous, but it's the only way we can be sure whether Stormwing's seal holds or not. You need to be prepared.</p>

          <p>Yes, I realize the danger is increasing exponentially. I don't blame you for your caution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've done more than enough. We've come this far thanks to your help.</p>

          <p>I will report our findings so far to Richelle, and request she send another Daeva to take us the rest of the way. Thank you.</p>

          <p>You're right, that is strange. The Ancient Dragonbound Document says nothing about needing anything else to activate the Rift Orb.</p>

          <p>Herka learned from the restored Ancient Dragonbound Document that the Rift Orb in the Ritual Chamber where you fought Isbariya the Resolute is a teleporter to Stormwing's prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She further discovered that an item called the Quartz Rod was needed to power the Rift Orb. She asked you to get it, as it was the only way to check on Stormwing's status.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated the Quartz Rod's caretaker, Shadowshift, and took the Rod to the Ritual Chamber. However, the Rift Orb did not work. Herka was stumped.</p>
