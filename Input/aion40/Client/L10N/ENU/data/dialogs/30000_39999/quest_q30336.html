          <p>Tataka sees that Daeva has kept Noble Siel's Supreme Greatsword safe. But Tataka wonder how much longer that true, since Daeva skills now betterer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It like cooking. When Tataka keep meat out too long--like, two, three weeks--Tataka no longer need meat. Throw meat away, get new meat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what if Noble Siel's Supreme Greatsword not like meat. What if Tataka could make sword something that stick with Daeva long time, like eating lot of cheese at once.</p>

          <p>Daeva must put together three things. Very rare, hard to get. Once Daeva has found ingredients, Daeva can do the rest. What Daeva think?</p>

          <p>Daeva must first gather Snout of Tutty...no wait, that wrong list. That recipe.... Ah, here right list. Here we go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva need three ingredients. Sealed Balaur has [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01]--he in the Beshmundir Temple--and Shulack captured by Nightshade Clan can get you [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a] if you help him. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] is other thing. Special mineral Shulacks use. Very expensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Daeva gets these, Daeva must go to Debilkarim's Forge furnace. Put everything in there and forge. That make Essence of Siel crystal, and you bring that to Tataka.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You obtained the Vorpal Essence, Special Shulack Refiner, and Blessed Aurium Ingot, and went to the Jotun Studio. You forged them together with the Noble Siel's Supreme Greatsword to make a crystal called the Essence of Siel.</p>
