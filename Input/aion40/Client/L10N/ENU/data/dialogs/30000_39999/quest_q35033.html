          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever been nervous about entering a dilapidated old temple? Felt ashamed about the overgrown weeds on Aion's Holy Grounds? Have you found yourself alone in a space that should be filled with bright meditation? Then it comes as no surprise to you that many Holy Grounds are abandoned during wartime. Yet, Sanctum doesn't seem interested in rebuilding or maintaining them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are taking the initiative! The Alabaster Order protects not just Elyos, but also the worship of the Empyrean Lords and the authority of Aion. We call upon all Alabaster Order members to find [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35033_01] and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35033_02], then submit these to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007]. The materials will reconstruct temples and Holy Grounds. Help protect the sanctity of our spiritual health!</p>

          <p>Though Daevas can rest wherever Aion's light reaches, we need a place to nourish our souls as well.</p>
