        	<p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something unthinkable has happened. A group of Lepharist Revolutionaries attacked one of our high-ranking Daevas and stole a list of our members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, the roster is protected by a spell that causes an explosion should an unauthorized person attempt to break its seal...and now we hear reports of a mysterious explosion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, [%username], member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to search the main roads of Theobomos for any [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35015] and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35014].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must preserve our secrecy. For the good of all Elyos!</p>

          <p>Aion's blessing was with us. A sun-chanced thing that we chose to attach that spell to the Alabaster Order's membership roster.</p>
