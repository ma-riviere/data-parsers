          <p>Ah, Daeva is in luck! Tataka has just finished authentic Kobold omelette! Might be little gooey...and eggs not fresh...and used dirty pan...but still taste great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's this? Hmmmm...Daeva has gotten stronger, Tataka can tell. Daeva might be able to enhance Noble Siel's Supreme Sword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva came to improve weapon? Not to try Tataka's omelette?</p>

          <p>Daeva is missing out, is tasty omelette!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh well, Tataka does not expect Daeva to appreciate Kobold cooking. Now...to improve Daeva's weapon, Tataka needs three special materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very rare materials! Is Daeva willing to find them?</p>

          <p>Daeva will need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sealed Balaur in Beshmundir Temple has Vorpal Essence. Help Shulack captured by Nightshade Clan to get Special Shulack Refiner. Blessed Aurium Ingot is special mineral used by Shulacks, very expensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once Daeva has all three, go to Debilkarim's Forge and fuse together to create Essence of Siel, then bring to Tataka.</p>

          <p>Well then...perhaps Daeva would like to be first to taste new and improved Kobold spicy curry? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is great honor, Daeva. Tataka promises, no side effects this time! First Reian to try vomited for week...but recipe is much improved since then!</p>
