          <p>[%username], time is flying, flying away! The dreamers and the schemers of Pandaemonium seek you for ascension. It's time for your ceremony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once they have honored you, you can climb through their ranks. Climb as high as you dare!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Answer me this: what do you know of the Archons?</p>

          <p>Then take heed! In Daeva society, they are the mighty...Asmodae's best. The Archons will test you as a new Daeva, and their tests are often so subtle you might not even notice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Archons will tempt you with power, but resist! Resist! Keep a low profile at first, and meddle not in the games of the Archons. Leap too soon and you'll fall too far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But not all of Pandaemonium is schemes and deceit. I know a guide you can trust.</p>

          <p>Now that you're a Daeva, you must learn to let go. Let go! The Humans you know will live their lives, grow old, and die. But not you--you will forever be a winged Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The guide, Heimdall, can help you leave Human travails behind and teach you all that a Daeva's life entails.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're ready to begin, I can teleport you within Pandaemonium's walls. Or, if you have some final farewells, you can return to the Humans, then teleport from Osmar's place in Aldelle.</p>

          <p>I have heard of your skills, and I have heard of your...background. Your past as a raider doesn't offend me, of course, but not everyone in this great city is as broad-minded.

          <p> </p>
          <p>But they shouldn't be. The Shedim Lords measured against all other Asmodians, and despite your circumstances, they chose you for ascension. That's all that matters.</p>
