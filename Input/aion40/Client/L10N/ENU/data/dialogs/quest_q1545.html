          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I've been studying those samples you gathered for me. I didn't find much, but I think I know why. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My new theory is that the real issue is probably detectable only in the in the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3_38_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The distinction is small, but important.</p>

          <p>No...no...no...well, not exactly. You see, every Spirit has its own essence. It's a kind of crystal made from condensed energy. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The nature or ability of a Spirit is determined by its essence. So, inspecting the essence of a spirit can tell you a lot about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've received essence samples taken from spirits in other areas. If I can get some essence from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3_38_An]s around here, I can compare them.</p>

          <p>Sillen asked you to gather Essence of Earth so she can compare the local samples ot ones from healthy creatures elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You volunteered to assist her, and hunted Decayed Earth Spirits until you had gathered enough essence. When you delivered it to Sillen she said it looked very unusual, and she seemed quite excited.</p>
