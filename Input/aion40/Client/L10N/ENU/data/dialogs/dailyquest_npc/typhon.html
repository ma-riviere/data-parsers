          <p>Ah, [%username]. I've heard of you! We welcome registrations from any Daeva of your quality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me tell you a bit about our illustrious society. We are called the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand--the Alabaster Order, for short--and, in concert with Sanctum, we acquire information on dark deeds and look after the Elyos in our region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Participation in the Order is, of course, completely voluntary. After all, we only want the most driven, talented Daevas amongst our ranks. And those driven, talented Daevas stay with us because they believe in our cause and appreciate our rewards. </p>

          <p>With talent like yours on the membership rolls, our reputation can't help but grow! Now let me tell you how this works.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll send you letters with our calls to action. If you choose to complete a mission, you'll be rewarded with a Progress Token. Once you've collected a certain number of Tokens, you can exchange them for rewards with any of our Stewards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before you ask, yes, we are an exclusive Order. While you're with us, you can't join any other organizations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you catch all that? Sometimes I think I should just hand out a brochure...</p>
