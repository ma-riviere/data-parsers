          <p>Yes... I have been searching for him for almost a year. We used to be so close.... We were traders who shipped goods all over Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, we were attacked by a pirate fleet and I was captured. They put me on one of the ships and worked me like a dog, nyerk. Then I was rescued by the Daemons. I was so grateful, I started working for them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since then, I have asked other Daemons to find word of my brother. I do not know if he was captured too or escaped...or if he is even alive. It has been so long, but nothing yet....</p>
