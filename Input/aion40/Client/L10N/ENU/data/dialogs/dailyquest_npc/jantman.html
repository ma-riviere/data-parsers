          <p>The Circle and these shields have much in common. Both play important supportive and defensive roles for those in need.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Of course, The Circle works offense as well. Pity we don't have shields to match that.</p>   
          <p> </p>   
          <p>Still, what we do have is quite impressive. Have a look.</p>

          <p>There seems to be some confusion here.... I can't help you.</p>

          <p>Perhaps speaking with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Petarca] in Pandaemonium about The Circle would clear things up?</p>
