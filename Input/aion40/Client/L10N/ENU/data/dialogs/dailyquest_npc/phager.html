          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. I thought I recognized you. I never forget a mane. Well, not usually. Well, not since breakfast. Ish. Have we met? I forget.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, are you here looking for weapons? You got tokens, I got weapons. You got questions, you need to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan.</p>

          <p>Something has gone wrong--very wrong. I can't do my job! Blast! Shards! Fie!</p>

          <p>Please enter /petition in your Chat window and inform a GM.</p>

          <p>I'm counting on you, [%username], to help me.</p>

          <p>I don't think I can help you. I handle quite a lot, but not this. I could handle more, but they won't let me. Not since the incident with the qooqoo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you don't have enough marks or you're not a Field Warden, you can't very well come around expecting rewards. Goes without saying, really. But I just said it, didn't I? So I guess it goes with saying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] over in Beluslan. Long walk, that is--have fun getting there.</p>
