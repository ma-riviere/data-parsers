          <p>Faith and arms, [%username]. We've been seeing a lot of each other lately!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you're here to redeem your Alabaster Order Progress Tokens. Correct?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please be aware that I can't give you rewards you haven't earned. Before you come to me, you'll need to be registered in the Alabaster Order. President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] can get you set up if you aren't yet. </p>

          <p>Yes, I can see you're confused. Please keep in mind that the Alabaster Order is a grand society with many members. We need many different Stewards to show our appreciation to our Daevas in the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid you need to see a different Steward, [%username], one more suited to your class.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And don't come back to see me about this again! Confused members are almost as bad as the non-members who haven't even talked with President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] in Heiron yet.</p>
