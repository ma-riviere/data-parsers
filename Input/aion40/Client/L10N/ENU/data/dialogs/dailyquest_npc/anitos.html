          <p>Faith and arms and all that sunny tripe, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm the captain of the Fortuneers Legion--the most feared band of fortune hunters this side of Balaurea. We don't take just any sword-swinger into our group. You'll have to prove yourself over time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you think you have what it takes to be one of us, step right up. Have a question for me? You know who also has a question? This Shulack begging for Kinah down by the tavern. If you have a question, go stand beside him because I don't answer questions. I'm the Captain! Now, you ready to join the Fortuneers?</p>

          <p>But it's not all Aether and ales! I have more scars on my body than Elysea has roads, and each one tells the story of a bounty. I've earned the right to be Captain of the Fortuneers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you join us, your life will never be the same again...well, maybe a little shorter. We capture criminals, we take out the most wicked of killers, and we chase treasure no matter where it leads us. That's what we do, we're Fortuneers. Glory is our sail and fortune our wind.</p>

          <p>The more bounties you take on, the more rewards you get. Speaking of, I have bounties backing up left and right. You can get started as soon as you wipe that silly look off your face. I've seen Shugos meaner than you.</p>
