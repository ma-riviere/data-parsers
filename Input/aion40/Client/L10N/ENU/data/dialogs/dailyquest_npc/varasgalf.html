          <p>Hey, [%username], ever taken a look at a Circle Token? It's square! Sure, the hole is circular, but doesn't that seem odd to you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There must be a reason. Hmm, I hear Lord Marchutan had mysterious purposes in founding The Circle, apart from helping new Daevas....</p>  
          <p> </p>  
          <p>Still, the tokens spend well, no matter what they look like. Need a shield?</p>
