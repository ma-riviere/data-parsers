          <p>Ahh, I see that word has spread about the Fortuneers Legion! Our ravenous reputation now spans one side of Elysea to the other. Even the Balaur now fear us, and they don't fear much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am Rima, the poetess of peril, as my comrades call me. I can compose a beautiful limerick as fast as I can sever your head from your shoulders!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Fortuneers have grown from a small group of treasure hunters into this mighty legion that you hear ballads sung about in the taverns. Children no longer dream of growing up merely to be Daevas...they want to be Fortuneers! The wind at their backs and a blade at their hip! Is this why you're here?</p>
