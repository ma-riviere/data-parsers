          <p>Azphelumbra, good Daeva. I represent the Marchutan Priory, an organization for the betterment of Asmodian Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Along with The Circle, we devote ourselves to strengthening our people for the battles of today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're not a member of the Priory, perhaps you'd like to join us? I'd be happy to answer any questions.</p>

          <p>The Marchutan Priory focuses first on recently ascended Daevas. We match them with more experienced Mentors, so they can learn and grow from first-hand combat experience in relative safety.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The second focus is...well, you'll find out for yourself when you're more seasoned.</p>

          <p>We will assign to you various tasks. You will need to find a Mentor to assist you in them.</p>

          <p>Yes, many Daevas expect us to supply them, but that too is part of the process. I know you will do well.</p>
