          <p>May you craft in Azphel's shadow. Crafting works in mysterious ways, doesn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, even with the correct design and materials, the results vary each time depending on your passion and the environment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The perfect item usually means investing significantly of both time and money. Even more, no craftsman can make perfect items every time. But sometimes, something extraordinary is born from the ordinary and the mundane.</p>
