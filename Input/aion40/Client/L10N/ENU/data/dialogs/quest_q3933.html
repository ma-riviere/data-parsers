          <p>I'll be blunt: Everything you've done so far was just a prelude--now the real symphony begins. The cost will be high...in every sense of the word.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But think of the payoff. If we Elyos are a chosen people, then how do you think it will feel to be the chosen elite of a chosen people?</p>
