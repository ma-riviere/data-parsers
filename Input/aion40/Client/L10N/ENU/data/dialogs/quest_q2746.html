          <p>In the midst of a fierce fight with the blasted Balaur the Ellies saw an opportunity and exploited it. We did our best against the two armies, but then a sneak attack destroyed the Guardian General, and the battle for the fortress was lost. </p>

          <p>I'll say it is. We cannot let the enemy keep the fortress. We must weaken the enemy and recapture the fortress at all costs!</p>

          <p>Defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2746_all]s guarding the fortress and bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2746a] as proof. Take a few good allies with you--going alone will be suicide. Only the strongest can occupy the fortress.</p>
