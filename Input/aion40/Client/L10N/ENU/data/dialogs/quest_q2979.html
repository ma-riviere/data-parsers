          <p>Hmm... this dressing was a bold choice, but it works very well with the vegetables. Mmm... I never would have thought to use those spices in a smoothie of all things, but I really like it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see. Ahh! The fish is flaky and delicious... harmonious as a well-tuned chorus. Lastly, the chowder! Ah, a sip is like standing in the middle of a field of flowers.</p>
