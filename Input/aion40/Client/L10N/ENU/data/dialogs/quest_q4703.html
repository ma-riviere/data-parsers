          <p>As long as you're off to the Nochsana Training Camp, I've another favor to ask. Those Balaur instructors are the ones who train the Draconute soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be quite effective if we could eliminate those who make the Balaur effort go smoothly, as I'm sure you understand.</p>
