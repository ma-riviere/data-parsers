          <p>It's ancient Atreian, but you probably guessed that already. I think it's about some kind of colossal machine....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These diagrams and equations aren't really in my purview as an archaeologist. Try taking this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Coeus] in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>From the looks of it, these are some of research notes from Project Drakanhammer project.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is amazing...Theobomos has done things I never would've thought possible. Look here--he was extracting the power of Spirits to operate Project Drakanhammer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose now we know what that machinery you saw in there was for. Talk to Pyrrha and see if you can't mount a second expedition inside.</p>

          <p>Extracting the power of Spirits? I've seen broken machinery in other ruins that could have been intended for that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the machinery inside's still functioning, it would be the discovery of a lifetime. Finally we could reclaim the technology of ancient Atreia!</p>
