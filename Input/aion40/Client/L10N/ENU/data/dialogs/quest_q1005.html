          <p>You've shown the rest how the job is done, and now, I'm entrusting you with a final mission. Never mind [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF1_name]. [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA05] itself depends on your success here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You and Pernos stopped the Tursin Krall from refining their Odium, but as it happens, you were too late. They're using the power of [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA13] to open a gateway to the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA14].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This proves the Krall still serve their Drakan masters. If the gate opens, the Balaur will escape the prison the Empyrean Lords cast them into during the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Balaur are freed... well, it doesn't even bear thinking about. I need you to destroy the gate.</p>

          <p>The creatures protecting the gate are far stronger than the Krall we've encountered so far. Getting in isn't going to be easy. However, there is one who should be able to help us.</p>

          <p>Actually, I believe you've met him. According to Polinia, old [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12] is a [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas are sensitive to [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA13], so Pernos should be able to detect the Aether the Kobolds have processed and point us to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to hurry to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA06] and convince [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12] to locate the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_14] for us. Maybe you'll have better luck with him than I did. Lords, that old man is peevish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only pray Polinia is right about him. We won't have time to summon other [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA27].</p>

          <p>So the Krall have opened an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_14], have they? Well, that certainly explains the changes in the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA13] flow. Ok, I'll help you.</p>

          <p>Hmm... I see. The Aether has gathered in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA08]. I believe you'll find your gate there. You should probably speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_LA21]--I understand he's stationed in the area.</p>
