          <p>Indeed. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ludina] of the Dionysia Tavern came to me, a hood drawn across her face, and asked me to set up a clandestine meeting between the two of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It’s all very strange. She was reluctant to tell me why, and she came to me only because she had no other way to contact you. I suspect this has something to do with your past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I urge you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA40] and meet with her as soon as possible. The matter seemed most urgent.</p>

          <p>You were the Brigade General of a secret legion in service to Lady Ariel, a legion known only to a select and fortunate few as the Mirage Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were the elite, the glittering edge of Elysea's blade, and with you at the helm none could stand in our way. Before...we were sent on a mission. It was dangerous, but our hearts beat boldly with a confidence born of success. We were to go to Karamatis to find the Artifact of Memories.</p>

          <p>Of course, I tried desperately to gather information, even just to find out if they were alive or dead, but to no avail. My efforts met with cold silence and eventually I had to accept that the legion had been lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was utterly alone. My greatest wish was to seek Lady Ariel's guidance, but as a lone soldier...it was not my place. But you had given me an assignment of the utmost secrecy, one that was imperative to securing our future.</p>

          <p>You assigned me to Sanctum, on my own, so that I might find the informant and infiltrate those who pulled his strings.

          <p>Having heard that someone is looking for a Daeva who has lost his memory, you travelled to the Sliver of Darkness in Verteron and met Icaronix.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to Icaronix, you were the Brigade General of the Mirage Legion, a secret Legion under the direct command of Lady Ariel. Your legion disappeared whilst on a mission to retrieve the Artifact of Memory from Karamatis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Icaronix said that, when you left, he attempted to locate a traitor inside the legion. He told you that he had kept the investigation details in a box stored deep inside a nearby cave. You went to find the box as he instructed, only to discover his story was a trap.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legionary Ecus, now a wandering soul, told you he had discovered the traitor: Icaronix, only to be swiftly killed by him. With the help of Ecus' soul, you escaped from Icaronix's trap, met Lavirintos and Miriya, and received permission to use Stigma Stones.</p>
