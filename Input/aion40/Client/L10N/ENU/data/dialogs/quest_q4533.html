        <body>
          <p>As I mentioned to you earlier, the zombies you destroyed so efficiently were once villagers. They loved and cried and felt pain and shame, just as you do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it wasn't their fault. The original sin wasn't theirs, but one of the vigilantes, who was tasked with protecting the villagers but who first touched Beritra's Weapon, and unravelled everything in an instant. Irony's taste is bitter, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creature still exists, and still spreads the poison that twists your fellow man into something terrible. Destroy him, and perhaps all troubles will slip away like summer leaves on autumn trees.</p>

          <p>This creature looks just like the other vigilantes who were corrupted by his misstep. The only way we can guarantee his death is by destroying them all. A hammer blow to crush an insect perhaps, but it is the only way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill each of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF3C2_SkeletonCurseD_35_An]s you find around [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2052_Etc]. Return to me when your task is complete.</p>
