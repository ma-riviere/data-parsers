	<p>Have you brought some Ancient Seals back from the Balaur Treasury?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They are worth little in the open market, but Sanctum has recently commissioned us to gather them for research purposes.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>All Daevas who hand us Ancient Seals will be rewarded with Abyss Points. The condition and age of the Seal will dictate the level of reward.</p>

	<p>Well, it's an Ancient Seal all right, but one of the least valuable ones around.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These were mass produced, you see, and so lack a lot of the finesse and craftsmanship that other Seals are known for.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Still, it is a treasure, and you should be rewarded for returning to the Elyos people.</p>

	<p>Ah, yes, it is indeed! Unfortunately the damage it has sustained is significant, to say the least, and devalued what would otherwise have been a wonderful find.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The Balaur have no respect for our history, our culture. They take our rarest treasures and pile them up alongside dead slaves and veritable junk. Seeing a treasure like this...infuriates me so much!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>We'll do what we can to restore it, though I am not hopeful.</p>

	<p>My word! Just look at it!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Even now, we cannot create Seals of comparable quality. The craftsmanship is astonishing, the care and attention that went into its creation infinite.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>This will be sent on to Sanctum right away.</p>

	<p>I...I don't know what to say.</p>

	<p>I hardly ever see these. I hear about them, sure, but to actually hold one in my own two hands is so rare. These belong in museums and in the care of true curators, not I!</p>

	<p>Don't try and deceive me, [%username]. I've seen the Daevas who are capable of surviving the onslaught that is the Balaur Treasury. They are hulking creations, blessed by Ariel herself, and the steel in their eyes is absolute, unwavering.</p>

	<p>You are not the same as them, Daeva. I cannot believe that you procured the Seals yourself. I cannot accept them.</p>

	<p>No, keep a hold of that for now, or the Abyss Points will go to waste. You see, there's a limit to how many points you can have, until you grow stronger. Or maybe you'll have some kind of accident and need a top-up. Either way, let me know!</p>

	<p>These Seals aren't just pretty tokens. They show us the history of Atreia and cast away the darkness that clouds our memories.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They're important to us, which is why we reward those that recover our ancient treasures with Abyss Points. Work hard for Sanctum, and she will reward you well, my friend.</p>

	<p>Faith and arms!</p>

	<p>I'm sorry, [%username], but it doesn't look like you brought me any Ancient Seals. Perhaps you confused them for something else?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>They're most commonly found in the Balaur Treasury of all places. Find them, then bring them back, and I'll be sure to reward you with a fitting number of Abyss Points.</p>
