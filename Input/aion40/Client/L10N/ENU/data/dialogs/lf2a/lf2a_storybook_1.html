          <p>Day 11</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The last few mornings, I've discovered a Qooqoo and a Porgus missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought a wandering Karnif might be taking them. I set traps, but every morning, more animals were gone. Then crops began to disappear. Something other than animals is involved here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll stand watch tonight.</p>

          <p>Day 12</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how many hours I'd waited when a pair of red eyes appeared in the darkness and approached my property.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I held my breath as the eyes drew near, but they suddenly disappeared. I heard footsteps retreating into the woods. I shot a couple arrows, but didn't know if I'd hit anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This morning, I checked the forest floor--no trace of blood.</p>

          <p>I got it! And what a hideous creature it is!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's got a Kobold's body with a face like a Bellepig. It has long, sharp fangs at the corners of its mouth, hard enough to be used as a knife without crafting. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its skin, covered with short, tough hair, is as hard as a Gorgon's. When I cut it with a diamond knife, I found a thick layer of fat right underneath the skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I discovered something else.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Entries that look like dates suggest it might be a diary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creature looks like an animal but keeps a diary? I need to learn more.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm visiting the Library of the Sages as I write this, to learn about my thief. Today my research finally paid off. A lady named Fuchsia pointed out a book that had some of my answers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creature is called a Calydon. Its main habitat is Theobomos, and its fangs and skin are traded at high prices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm intrigued. It's more than I knew before, but it's not enough to satisfy me.</p>

          <p>Day 28</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've made my decision. I've lived in one place for too many years. It's time to move. I'm going to Theobomos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to find out about Calydons for myself. And there may be money to be made there. Every Shugo I've talked to seems interested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've spent the last few days preparing. I've sold everything I've collected to a general merchant in trade for food, potions, and arrows. It's all stored in my cube. And in just a few minutes, I'm off to a teleporter.</p>

          <p>Day 33, Theobomos</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took me several teleports to get here. The Meniherk Excavation Camp was my last taste of civilization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>The land seems abandoned. Fregion's Flame killed most of the living creatures here--the rest fled. There are neither flight paths to other places nor a current map available.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've purchased an ancient map from an old fox named Yadamonerk. It's all I have to go on. It's helpful, although the land has changed completely. I have no idea what awaits me.</p>

          <p>Day 72, Theobomos</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The past few weeks have been nerve-wracking. I was almost killed by a herd of Viragos and nearly burned by Fire Spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last week, an alleged explorer stole all my food and money.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yesterday, I set up tents around cliffs to watch the Calydons. Soon enough they discovered me and attacked by night. I seem to be safe near Fregion's Flame--Calydons, it looks like, are afraid of fire.</p>

          <p> </p>
         <p>Calydons must be wildly fertile. Their numbers never decrease no matter how hard I hunt them.</p>
          <p> </p>      
          <p>Ever since I learned to distinguish the males from the females, I've discovered how complex their society is. They're sexually dimorphic: The big warriors are female, the small shamans are male.</p>
          <p> </p>     
          <p>From outside, stronger females seem to lead the herd. But after months of observation, it's clear to me that the main power is held by the male shamans.</p>

          <p>I don't think all males become shamans. I've seen some male warriors. I suspect that only those males who can use magic become shamans.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Male warriors are definitely in the minority. They're weaker than females and often fall behind in battle.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Yesterday at dawn, I went to watch my trap and discovered some Calydons following a Human. I drove them away from their prey, a skinny Human boy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I offered him soup, which he gulped as if he were starving. When I tried to take him to the Observatory village, he burst into tears and begged me to protect him.</p>
          <p> </p>      
          <p>His name was Daniel. He told me he grew up on his parents' farm. He met a man named Cavil in the market who became his mentor. Cavil, it turned out, was a Lepharist Revolutionary.</p>

        <p>At the same time Daniel found out Cavil's true identity, a priest learned about it, too. He tried to bring Daniel up on charges of treason. Daniel ran away to Theobomos. He told me he'd rather die than go to prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I didn't know what to do. I've lived alone for hundreds of years....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something in his eyes appealed to me. I could use an apprentice. He has sense and strength. He could be a good hunter with practice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This morning I told him I'd take him on. I gave him a new name--Sevrian. It's a new beginning for us both.</p>
