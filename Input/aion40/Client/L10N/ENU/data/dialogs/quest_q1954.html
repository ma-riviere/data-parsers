          <p>Too often the kitchen is hidden at the back of a building, as if the preparation of food is something to be ashamed of. Good food does not just appear, delicately arranged and garnished. Its character is formed by the ability of the chef, the experience infusing each mouthful with subtle nuances of flavor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you already know this. Hidden behind the dutiful [%userclass] is a promising young cook. The scent of culinary talent is unmistakable to an old hand like me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so glad you continue to visit me. It shows your dedication to the culinary arts. And today I have a favor of a different sort to ask of you.</p>

          <p>I have a package that needs delivering. It's nothing too big--just some chopped Ruta--but it's essential that it is taken quickly...to Denegos...in the Abyss</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry! It's only a quick delivery, so no need to linger if you are anxious to get back!</p>

          <p>Such a small delivery might seem pointless to one who doesn't understand the finer points of cooking. Denegos is preparing a feast and will surely be grateful.</p>

          <p>Hmm...this certainly complicates things. I had rather expected you to be more helpful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Denegos is preparing a feast tomorrow, you see, and needs those chopped rutas as soon as possible. A feast without chopped rutas is like a Shugo without something to sell!</p>

          <p>Ah well, it can't be helped I suppose.</p>
