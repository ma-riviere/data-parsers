          <p>Being an officer to Chanters and Clerics isn't as peaceful as you might imagine. The training we undergo...sensitizes us to certain things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's especially bad here in Brusthonin. With the undead everywhere, my senses are constantly screaming at me about negative energies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like having a mid-level headache, all the time. Can you imagine what that's like?</p>

          <p>That's an understatement. [%dic:STR_DIC_W_NAME_IDDF2A_Adma] is the worst. I look at it, and see a seething cauldron of gloom and despair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_DeathknightNamed_50_Ah] is a major cause, of course. It's as though his presence bolsters all the undead in his realm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he were dealt with, my life, not to mention the lives of everyone who lives here, would be much easier. Is that something you're interested in doing?</p>

          <p>You're one of the braver Daevas I've ever met. Most of them linger as little as possible here. I can't say I blame them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will take much effort to get into Adama, and even more to defeat its lord, but nothing that would bring so much good to the world is easy.</p>

          <p>Don't worry, I don't expect you to risk your life for compassion alone. You'll be rewarded if you succeed.</p>

          <p>Something's definitely changed. My headache's gotten better. It's not completely gone, but it's noticably improved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The undead have also become less aggressive. I see the faintest, faintest spark of hope in the eyes of the residents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think this means you have met with success.... [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_DeathknightNamed_50_Ah] is no more, is he?</p>

          <p>Besides which, as an unliving thing, he could yet return. We must remain vigilant. But this might make reviving Brusthonin a little bit easier for a while.</p>

          <p>Rumolt's sensitivity to negative energies is causing him misery. For his sake, and the sake of Brusthonin, he asked you to destroy the undead Lord Lannok.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You managed to infiltrate Adama Stronghold and sent the miserable lord into the afterlife. Rumolt was quite grateful, and rewarded your courage.</p>
