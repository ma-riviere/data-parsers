          <p>A Soul Healer's duty is never finished, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Daeva, we are blessed with immortality. We don't have to worry about the same dangers as Humans. But even immortality comes at a price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The soul is wearied by death, and each time we die, we lose a part of ourselves. A Soul Healer's job is to restore what was lost. For the glory of Asmodae, we follow our people, our soldiers and our Archons to the most forbidding places. </p>

        <body>
          <p>As I was healing injured residents yesterday, I noticed many had been poisoned. I can heal mortal wounds and restore souls, but purging poison is another matter. Poison is much harder to treat than battle wounds, and far more dangerous as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are several creatures around here that inflict poisonous wounds, and if we could get rid of some of them it would lessen the workload on the Archons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think, [%username]? Can you help?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Their potent poison is dangerous to both Humans and Sapiens, but for a Daeva slaying them should be nothing.</p>
