          <p>Oh, hey [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I showed Hjuki that mithril you brought back. I hoped he could figure out how to extract the impurities, but he said it'd cost more than the metal's worth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess it was worth trying, but it's puzzling--the book I read said that mine is famous for its purity. I think there's only one place the mithril can be.</p>

          <p>I'm guessing that the miners were always prepared for Balaur attack, so they left the impure mithril laying around as a decoy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If something happened and the miners fled, they'd take the pure ore with them and leave the junk ore for the enemy to find.</p>

          <p>The miners fled the mine, taking the ore with them, but they never made it back. Instead they died and became undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm betting that if you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2B_SZ_A2_2] and search [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_ZombieFarmerD_46_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_TestresultZombieD_47_An]s, you could hit the mother lode.</p>
