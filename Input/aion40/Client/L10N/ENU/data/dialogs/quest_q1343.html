          <p>I have news for you, [%username] if you're ready to hear it. About what made the Stoneshell Ksellids violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our investigation revealed that the caravan was not so innocent, and was attempting to capture Ksellikis--the young Ksellids--alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their big mistake was that they tried to catch [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardNamed_31_An].</p>

          <p>You don't know the story of Andre? It is unbelievably huge for a Ksellid.</p>

          <p>Speedy is its child, and will be just as huge when it's fully grown.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's clear those greedy travelers paid the price for their bad judgment.</p>

          <p>In the end, I fear we all will. More people may have another try at capturing it, and we'll be digging even more graves before this is done.</p>
