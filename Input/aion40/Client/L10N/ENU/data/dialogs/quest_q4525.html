          <p>I've always been fascinated by magic. That's why I have the job I have today. But I want to do more than just interact with spellcasters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to research spells, create them, even learn to use the enemy's own powers against them. That would be beautiful irony, don't you think?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I've been learning as much about monster skills and spells as I can. I recently heard about a fascinating figure: Commander Bakarma.</p>

          <p>Oh, I know, I know. It's just that...I heard he can not only stun multiple foes at once, he can turn them into qooqoos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine! A huge Drakan like that, changing Daevas into qooqoos! If I knew how he did it, I could prevent it, perhaps even emulate it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'll need a personal account, maybe some residual energy, to do it. I can't leave here, so if you could face and defeat Commander Bakarma, I'd reward you greatly.</p>

          <p>Wonderful! This is so exciting! No, you don't have to do anything special; just go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_H] and fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDF3_DrakanFiBossD_50_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He should use his qooqoo spell during the battle. Even if he doesn't, I should be able to examine the energies left behind from the attacks he does use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll prepare both my research materials and your reward for when you return. In the name of magic!</p>

          <p>But you don't understand! I can't just listen secondhand to these stories. I have to have some kind of trace magical power to work with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ugh! If only those others had come to me sooner, before the residual energies on them faded away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I could hire Charlirunerk's Daemons. I hear they have some pretty strong members....</p>

          <p>Imagine this: you're facing down a legion of Balaur. The Sorcerer behind you chants a spell in Balic. All of a sudden...all your foes are qooqoos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's my ultimate goal: to learn about the core, the specific weave, of magic, so I can use them to better ends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So did Bakarma use the skill? Were you one of those affected? What did it feel like?</p>

          <p>Marvelous! Between your description, and the residual energies I'm now drawing from you, I think I can make some great progress!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to say, though: this spell betrays a sense of humor I didn't know the Drakan even had. Strange foes, they are....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, please accept this. It's the least gratitude I can show for someone who's helped me so much.</p>

          <p>Art wants to learn about the "Qooqoo You" spell cast by Commander Bakarma. He asked you to fight the Drakan to advance his research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Draupnir Cave, terminated Commander Bakarma, and returned to tell him all about being a qooqoo. Art was very pleased at this progress in his efforts.</p>
