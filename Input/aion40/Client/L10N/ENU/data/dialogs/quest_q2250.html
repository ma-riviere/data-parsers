          <p>I heard stories of Lepharist robbers attacking people. But I didn't think it'd happen to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were doing fine all the way up to the Moslan Forest, but then I started getting this creepy feeling, like somebody was following us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then we got jumped by Lepharists. They took everything....</p>

          <p>Stick around, this sob story only gets better. See, in that cargo was some Kandula I picked myself. To make medicine for my poor, ailing mother, right?</p>

          <p>I'm not gonna get the rest of the cargo back, but do you think you could help me get some [%dic:STR_DIC_G_herb_d_n_c_10b]? For my mother?</p>
