          <p>Arieluma, young one. Ohhh...my back is aching and my knees no longer work like they used to. To remain a Human in this world of Daevas is a horrible punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen father...my father? Is he doing well, I hope? I only ask this because he hasn't replied to my last few letters.</p>

          <p>Well...that's good to hear. At least someone is doing well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know he would come and visit me, his only daughter, if he was not so busy. Don't you agree, young Daeva? He would come over every day and have some tea with his only daughter...if he was not so busy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day soon, I know he will invite me into his home. One day very soon. And then we'll have tea together every day, father and daughter.</p>

          <p>The gifts he bought me were very touching. So expensive, too. I know he spent a lot of Kinah to prove how much he loves me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do I look different to you today, Daeva? Do I look younger? I used the Wrinkle Remover my father bought for me? It has taken years off of my face. Now I know my father will love me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wrote him another letter, and I was hoping you would bring it to him for me. I know he is very busy lately, but I wanted to let him know how thankful I was for his gifts. And I had a few more ideas for new gifts he can buy me. Would you deliver this letter to him?</p>

          <p>That is wonderful of you, young Daeva! Thank you.</p>

          <p>I would deliver it myself but my knees no longer work like they used to, and my ankles swell up when I stand for too long. Have I told you about my sore back?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ohhh, listen to me, will you. An old woman nibbling your ear off with my worries. Thank you, young Daeva. And come back for tea anytime.</p>

          <p>In Ariel's name, what is this? Another letter? Better I lost my wings than read another of that old woman's letters! Every letter she sends me costs me Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a stack of them at home, and now you add one more to that list. Do you see this? Under my eyes here? They are wrinkles, and they were never here before that wretched old beast showed up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, [%username], I beg of you, no more letters. I know she's old and sweet and probably offers you tea, but this is the last one.</p>

          <p>One day soon the shadows will take her, and a father I'll be no more! That will be a day to celebrate, huh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The nectar of my loins...more like a curse from my loins! I am just grateful that I left her mother when I did, before another wrinkled old creature showed up and took the rest of my Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lady of Light, all this anger is not good for my skin. Look how much I've aged because of her.</p>
