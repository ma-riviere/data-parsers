          <p>Long ago, during the Millennium war, this land was ruled by a great Daeva named Theobomos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was a man of such great erudition that even the Empyrean Lords would call on him for advice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legend says he died defending this land against the Dragon Lord Fregion.</p>

          <p>Just imparting a little local color before you begin the hard labor.</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>Sanctum has ordered an excavation of Theobomos' ancient stronghold. We are commanded to retrieve anything that may be of value.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>The stronghold's long since succumbed to the ravages of time and battle, however, and there's little to find.</p>

          <p>There are some valuable artifacts to be had, but they are well-defended. I should say, they defend themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I speak, of course, of the living statues Theobomos made. It'd take a powerful Daeva to subdue them.</p>
