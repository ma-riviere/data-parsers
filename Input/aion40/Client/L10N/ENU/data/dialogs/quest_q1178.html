          <p>It's harder than I first thought, this neutralizing swamp poison business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum needs more than just the Ribbit samples we sent their way before.</p>

          <p>Meliodas's been preoccupied with that fire for days. He says the trees aren't talking to him, but he sure cuts them down with a gusto! I wouldn't want to send him any deeper in....</p>

          <p>At the top, though, are samples of the Swamp Plant that grows around here. They've found it elsewhere, too, so they can compare these to the uninfected variety.</p>

          <p>I'm far too busy to collect them, but I need to send them to Sanctum quickly.</p>
