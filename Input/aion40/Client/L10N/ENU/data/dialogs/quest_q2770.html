          <p>Those fortress guards are up to something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen them nosing around here more and more often.</p>

          <p>I'd like to go smack them around a little.</p>

          <p>You know soldiers can't leave their posts. This little tower may not look like anything much, [%username], but it is of strategic importance to Reshanta. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From here we monitor enemy movements at Asteria Fortress, and give warning when the enemy tries to re-take it from us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I did ask Primum Fortress for help, but it takes time for the Archons to arrive here. Can you help us?</p>

          <p>Thank you. I feel like a sitting Qooqoo out here. I know they have greater numbers, but I'd be embarrassed to be beaten down by a pack of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2770_all].</p>

          <p>If you could get a group of Daevas and take the battle to them, they'll think twice about sending anyone over here to attack us for a while.</p>

          <p>Good. We have gained time, but they don't give up easily. </p>

          <p>Sooner or later they will launch an attack, and they never seem to run out of troops.</p>
