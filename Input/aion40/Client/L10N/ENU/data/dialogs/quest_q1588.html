          <p>Regarding the Bollvig issue, Brigade General Perento has ordered all regions to consider the elimination of the undead THE top priority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's also ordered all Guardians in other regions to provide support for the effort--except those confronting the Balaur, of course.</p>

          <p>You've already guessed it--Arbolu's Haven is a special case.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're confronting the undead, but we have very few Guardians. We have mainly Daevas of Zephyr--great at recon, only average in a fight. Still, we need them. I'll handle that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you've dealt with the Elim before. Rumor is they owe you. I want you to ask them for support.  </p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tree_Nomove_Trajanus] is the one to talk to. Tell him what Perento said, and ask for as much help as possible.</p>
