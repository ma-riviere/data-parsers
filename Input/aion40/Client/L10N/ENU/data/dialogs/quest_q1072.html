          <p>If you're going to fight in Reshanta, there are a few things you need to know. Battles in the Abyss are vastly different from those in Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are new strategies...and new dangers.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>It's my job to make sure you understand these things so you've got a better chance of making it through your first fight.</p>

          <p>First, our ability to control the Abyss depends on controlling the fortresses. Capturing them is key, so pay attention as I explain how it's done.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're defending a fortress, you must protect the Guardian General at all costs, and the converse is true when you're on the offensive.</p>

          <p>Your next lesson is Artifacts. For that you'll go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Endaion].</p>
