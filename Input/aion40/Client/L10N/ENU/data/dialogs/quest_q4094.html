          <p>Why do you think? You think I actually care about Lukmann's "judgments?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard about this place, see? Heard it was full of treasure, and all you needed was time, and a good Daeva to work with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A week later old Lukmann walks into the Apellbine, and starts talking to me. Tells me he wants to head into Brusthonin and crack some skulls. Tells me he wants to enter Adma Castle. Tells me he needs help....</p>

          <p>Exactly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've put up with his preaching for long enough now--I want to get what treasure is inside that castle and get back to Pandaemonium. All I need is some help. Your help.</p>

          <p>Right, there are four treasures I've learned about. So you find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4094a]s, an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4094b], a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDF2a_Adma_FOBJ_Q4094C], and an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4094d], and we'll be set for life.</p>

          <p>Geunon spoke to you and revealed that he had little interest in Lukmann's mission, and was actually in Brusthonin to steal treasures from Adma Castle. He needed help, and asked you for assistance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You agreed to help, and searched every room of Adma Castle for the treasures. You then handed them over to Guenon, and received a cut of the money for your troubles.</p>
