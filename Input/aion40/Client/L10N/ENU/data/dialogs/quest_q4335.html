          <p>You know, in my mind, nature's only good looking from a distance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can look out over the horizon and admire the herds of Brax grazing, or watch a flock pass by overhead, but when you're just a few feet away from a stinking Sparkle, suddenly the awe just...slinks away.</p>

          <p>Some of the local wildlife have become a nuisance, and I need them dealt with. If you can help, you should. I will reward you well.</p>

          <p>Good. Nothing lights up my day like a genuine "can do" attitude.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First off, I want the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TrollReD_36_An]s blocking the entrance to the Aetheric Field Observatory removed. They've been hindering the villagers' movements to and from the observatory for far too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also want you to kill off some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FethlotNmD_36_n]es. They've been feeding on Rogen, leaving me with little for my potions. I don't need you to wipe them out, just dent their numbers so we can share resources.</p>

          <p>This is a secondary task to the Asmodian cause. If you do need to earn yourself some Kinah though, you know where to come.</p>

          <p>I thought so. It seems quieter here, as though the audience has hushed in preparation for the opening scene.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps now we can complete our work, and safeguard this great region against the threat of the Balaur and the Elyos. Time will tell, my friend.</p>
