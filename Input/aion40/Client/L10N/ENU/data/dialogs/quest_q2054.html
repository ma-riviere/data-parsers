          <p>You used to be able to journey to Alukina's Palace. The sea itself floated in the air!</p>

          <p>Anair Lighthouse lit the path for Daevas to wing their way there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sadly, the Quartz Lens disappeared from the lighthouse and the way has been lost. It's heartbreaking, really.</p>

          <p>Years ago, before ...well...before this was a frozen waste, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Baugi] was a pirate. To his credit, he's worked hard to make up for it.</p>

          <p>Yes, it's true--I used to be a pirate. I was young and I needed the work.</p>

          <p>It wasn't like a career. I never even bloodied my sword.</p>

          <p>The Quartz Lens of Anair Lighthouse disappeared long ago, taking with it the way to Alukina's Palace. Sleipnir believed that pirates stole the Quartz Lens, and asked you to interrogate Baugi, a former pirate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Baugi told you that Captain Hinden, a notorious pirate, was almost certainly the culprit and suggested you look for him. When you defeated the ghost of Captain Hinden, you found a letter with a clue to the location of the Quartz Lens. You found the Quartz Lens and re-lit the lighthouse, thrilling Sleipnir.</p>
