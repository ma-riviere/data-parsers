          <p>Ah! You've come at the right time! I've an important secret mission, [%username], that requires a few fine, ah, volunteers who can work independently of the legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Several renowned Daevas were recommended, but I think you have the best wings to carry out the mission, [%username].</p>

          <p>The Ellies managed to set up bind point on the Forsaken Isle--they paid dearly for it for that territory--now they watch for a chance to attack the fortress. We captured this fortress with blood of Asmodians, we cannot lose it again. We must drive out the sun-cursed Ellies from the Wings of Siel Archipelago immediately!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've decided to take the initiative and destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_1131_AttackTower_Li] on the Forsaken Isle. Without the Guard Tower those blasted Ellies will be dust under our wings! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, are you the right Daeva for the job? Will you carry out this mission?</p>

          <p>Good! Go now to the Forsaken Isle. The enemy's bind point is somewhere in the center of the island and is guarded by the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_1131_AttackTower_Li]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be warned, when you get close, the Elyos Guards will immediately attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must battle through the enemy lines and destroy that bind point, This mission will be tougher than milking a brax bull but I know that [%username] that you can handle it. </p>
