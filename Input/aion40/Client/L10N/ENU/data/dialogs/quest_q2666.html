          <p>I need a Daeva who can go to Alquimia Stronghold and push [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_OreCart_Q2666]. It's quite heavy and top secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked others to push it, but they couldn't budge it. I hope you'll help me, [%username]. Will you?</p>

          <p>The Lepharists are infiltrating every corner of Atreia under the guise of explorers. Nobody suspects an explorer. That's smart tactics. Brax patties! I use it myself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The explorers are actually distributing orders by hiding them in places like the mine cart. These ore carts carry order scrolls with messages about targets--Asmodian targets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can ruin the enemy's intelligence network if we search the mine cart and switch the order scrolls with false ones of our own design. If you push the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_OreCart_Q2666] to a hidden corner I'll handle the rest.</p>

          <p>I watched you from a hidden corner. You pushed the cart with all your strength--you really put your claws into it! I wanted to help you but I had to stay hidden. I didn't want to blow my cover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thanks to you, [%username], I succeeded in switching the order scrolls.</p>

          <p>Now we only need to set an ambush in the places we named in the false order scrolls and capture the Lepharists. Then the Lepharists' intelligence network will be destroyed. This plan is tighter than a Shugo's purse!</p>

          <p>Dewi said that the Lepharist spies were operating everywhere in Atreia and the Lepharists were hiding order scrolls in a mine cart in Alquimia Stronghold.</p>

          <p>Dewi has a plan to ruin the Lepharists' intelligence network, but in order to carry out the plan, you needed to push the mine cart to the corner where nobody could see.</p>

          <p>When you returned after pushing the mine cart, he told you that he switched the scrolls successfully.</p>
