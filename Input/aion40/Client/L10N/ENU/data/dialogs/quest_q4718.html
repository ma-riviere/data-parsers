          <p>When battling the Balaur, it's crucial that you don't ever let up your attack. If they get the time to put their battle line in order and mend their wounds.... Well, things go badly. For us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a plan of attack, but I need your help.</p>

          <p>It's not enough to just THINK you're with me. You must be with me.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Here's the plan. First, infiltrate the Dredgion. You must press the attack, and never give up ground. Keep fighting, keep pushing, keep them on the defensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During the conflict, do your best to focus on the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_NagaPr_50_Ae]s. If they can't heal, they can't fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Votan would like to hear a report on this tactic, [%username], but I don't know that we can draw conclusions from just one attempt. How about you try it three times, and then report in to him?</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll cause the Balaur serious damage, and prove your passion at the same time.</p>

          <p>If you have plans to infiltrate the Dredgion anyway, it shouldn't be a problem. Maybe I'm wrong....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's been quite a while since you ascended, and I'm pleased that you're still so passionate. You are a truly extraordinary Daeva. This should be a worthy reward for your diligence and dedication.</p>
