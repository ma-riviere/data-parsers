          <p>I know Radgrid is worried about Legion morale, what with the fortress battle and the ever-increasing number of Klaw around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think those Klaws are fantastic, though. I adore that they make constant trouble for the Elyos and breed like ribbits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I have a plan to ease her mind.</p>

          <p>I started hunting a few Klaws when I was first posted here. They breed so fast, I was afraid they'd take over the island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then I found something wonderful. Their shell material is very useful for armor and shields. Oh, the quartermasters loved me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been so busy lately, though, I've had no time to hunt a single [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Neut_all]. Can you collect some shells for me?</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. After you find a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Neut_all], kill it, take its shell, and bring it to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rather, bring me a stack of shells. I'll get them to the quartermasters.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only will reducing the number of Klaws help improve the Centurion's spirit, but having new armor should excite everyone in the Legion.</p>

          <p>The only thing I love more than prying a shell off a Klaw is watching one squish an Elyos guardian between its pointy little digits.</p>

          <p>Klaws versus Daevas... It's an interesting game. Don't you think so? How did you fare? I mean your fighting against Klaws.</p>
