          <p>We've taken control of the Western Fortress, but our grip is weak. We need to establish proper communication lines at the base, along with facilities for  logistics and reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This report though... The news here is worse. We've been so busy beating the Asmodians back that the Balaur have had time to regroup and rearm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're planning an invasion, [%username]. Here.</p>

          <p>Exactly my intentions--we just need combatants now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The report states the Balaur are gathering in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Wciel_SZ_All]. We need good reliable Daevas to go there and kill them where they stand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let them know we are not weak, [%username]. Illuminate their senses, and make them shudder with fear every time they see our glowing forms in the skies.</p>

          <p>As soon as you're ready, just knock the Noble Magic Ward that leads to the Balaur's [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Wciel_SZ_All]. Once you're there, your orders are simple--wreak havoc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A quick aside--as soon as you're detected, the Balaur will start hiding away their treasures. If you want to steal from them, strike hard and strike fast, else there will be naught to steal once their bodies have stopped twitching.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and one last thing. Kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LeftCiel_NagaWiNamedQ_35_Ah] for me. He owes me a couple of good scars.</p>

          <p>Both our enemies should now be reeling from their respective losses. But now is not the time to celebrate. We must strike again, push the blade further towards our enemies' hearts!</p>
