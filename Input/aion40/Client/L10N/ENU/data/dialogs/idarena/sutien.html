          <p>Oh dear, not another one! So many Daevas running around wearing completely inappropriate accessories.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have Insignias, I can fix your little problem for you, and nobody need ever know. Well, except everyone who saw you walk in here looking like that.</p>
