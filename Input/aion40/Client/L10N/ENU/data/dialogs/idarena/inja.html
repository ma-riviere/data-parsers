          <p>Oh dear, [%username], you're not prepared to use the Chaos Training Grounds. We must reserve them for Daevas of level 46 and up, who need a little more practice before they fight in the Coliseum. And I'm afraid you can't take your friends with you. This is a test of individual strength.</p>
