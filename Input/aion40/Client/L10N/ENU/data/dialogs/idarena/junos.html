          <p>Hmph. You look a little...unseasoned. Still, if you want to be useful in the fight against the Balaur and the Asmodians, I can't fault you for trying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid that the other contestants in the Arenas of Chaos and Discipline will eat you alive, but if you want to give it a try, make sure you know the rules.</p>

          <p>The Kaisinel Academy only opens the Arena of Glory to its members. It's in high demand, and we can't let just anyone in.</p>

          <p>Prove yourself in the Arena of Chaos or Harmony, by achieving one of the higher rankings, and you'll earn yourself the right to a ticket.</p>

          <p>I won't be holding my breath, though.</p>
