		<p>What a lot of Silver Coins! Not many come with sixteen these days.</p>

		<p>Yes, there are exactly thirty-two coins. I so seldom see that many at one time.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>And yet I had prepared a reward for the person who would bring so many. I'm not surprised that it was you, [%username].</p>
