          <p>You sure have skinny arms for a Warrior. You'll need to bulk up a bit before getting involved in group combat.</p>

          <p>Splendid!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To learn a new skill, buy the relevant Skill Manual from me, then read it. Very simple.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and a quick tip if you've got some loose change--you can buy Skill Manuals whenever you want, so if you buy as many as you can now, you won't have to keep returning.</p>

          <p>[%username], isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen you out there, and while you're fast, you shouldn't try to block when you could just as easily dodge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You get away with it now, sure, but if your technique doesn't improve by the time you leave Poeta, you'll be in serious trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, a Scout's strength is through speed and accuracy.</p>

          <p>You seem ambitious [%username]. Let me guess...you fancy yourself an able Ranger? Or perhaps a deadly Assassin? I wonder...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you've come to the right place--you can buy your Skill Manuals from me. Remember, you need to read the manuals to learn the skill. They're no good just sitting in your inventory!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and a quick tip--feel free to buy manuals you can't learn from yet. It'll save you travel time later.</p>

          <p>Ah, very well. Just remember--we Mages are delicate beings, [%username]. You should learn to feel comfortable with your current abilities before you seek to expand them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hah! Enough tutelage. I'll sell you all the Skill Manuals you need for now. Don't forget to read them, though!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's another free tip. You can buy manuals for skills you can't use yet to save you the trip back here later.</p>
