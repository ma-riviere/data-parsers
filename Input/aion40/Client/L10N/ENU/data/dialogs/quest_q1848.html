          <p>I've been looking into the hidden treasure chambers, [%username], and think I might have stumbled across something interesting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is what we know--every Fortress in Reshanta has a treasure chamber, but the chambers in the Krotan, Kysis and Miren Fortresses are larger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe the Balaur could be using those chambers for research, or perhaps to hide something from us.</p>

          <p>I have no idea. I'm a simple teleporter, [%username]. I have no combat experience, nor in-depth knowledge on Balaur tactics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I do hear things. And I do know that Krotan, Kysis and Miren Fortresses also have rooms that can only be entered with a specific key. These rooms are constantly guarded by fearsome Balaur warriors, each of whom are said to carry a certain stone on them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These stones might be the key to their movements. They've been seen entering rooms through locked doors, and I think those stones may be the answer.</p>

          <p>[%username], could you go and collect the stones for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once I have them, I can examine their properties and work out if they're some sort of teleportation device. It could result in a major breakthrough for our war effort.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Crotan_LizardRaKey_45_Ah]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Dkisas_LizardRaKey_45_Ah]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lamiren_LizardAsKey_45_Ah]s have the Round Rift Stones, while [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Crotan_NagaWiKey_45_Ah]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Dkisas_NagaWiKey_45_Ah]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lamiren_NagaFiKey_45_Ah]s have the Flat Rift Stones.</p>

          <p>We need to know how they do it, [%username]. Then we can stop them, and use their technologies for our own good. Don't you see that?</p>
