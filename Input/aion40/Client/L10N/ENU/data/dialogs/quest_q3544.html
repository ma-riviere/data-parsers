          <p>I don't mean to brag, but I think I'm a natural at the merchant gig.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm good with people and I'm good with sales, but my real strength is procurement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guarantee my customers that I can get them anything they need. And I do.</p>

          <p>It's not terribly hard, since customers at these outpost locations are pretty consistent with what they order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's only so much a soldier needs, you know? They just need lots of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So my biggest challenge isn't the items, it's the quantity. I buy in bulk whenever I'm at the fortress, then either carry them back, or have them delivered here.</p>

          <p>There's a catch, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My bags keep ripping from the weight of all the supplies. Things with pointy bits or sharp edges are particularly troublesome.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I've decided that I need to create a bigger, better bag. Do you want to give me a hand?</p>

          <p>Troll skin. I think that's the answer. It's a bit coarse, but it's tough as nails.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could help me acquire [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3544A], I can start crafting them. Double-stitching, I think...maybe triple, with a Mookie needle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best quality leather comes from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TrollRE_36_An]s in the Gray Fog Marshes.</p>

          <p>Darn. Hunting is not on my skills list. And those trolls are not going to hunt themselves. This will require some thought.</p>

          <p>Yes, it is rough. I'm sure my knuckles will be bloody before I get those bags made.</p>

          <p>But just look at how sturdy the stuff is.</p>
