          <p>Ah, you've met Heirnir. Normally no, but Heirnir is unique. He loved his wife and children so much that he cannot accept what he has become and thus will not fully die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such love is rare, but what good is it? His family is long dead. There is only pain left for him but he holds on regardless. I asked one of the priests, but they had no advice for me in helping him either. I cannot help him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still...seek out [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Seznec] up above Baltasar Cemetery. He is a Shaman, not a Soul Healer, but he might know a way. It won't hurt to ask.</p>

          <p>Do you speak of Heirnir? Yes, I have heard of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He holds onto life so desperately that his body is forced to obey. He should forget and lapse into undeath, but he does not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Soul Healer can do nothing for him. In truth, though, the solution to his problem is simple. Of course, there are always complications.... Give me a moment while I look something up.</p>

          <p>You met a dead man named Heirnir who believed he was still alive. He was in pain and desperate over the fate of his wife and daughters. He asked you for help to stop the pain and let him rest. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found the Soul Healer Senere and asked for her help. She told you there was nothing she could do and instead told you to seek out Seznec, a Shaman. </p>

          <p>Once you found Seznec, he told you there was a way to help Heirnir. He told you to wait while he looked something up.</p>
