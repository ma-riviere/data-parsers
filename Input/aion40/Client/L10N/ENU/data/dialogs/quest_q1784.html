          <p>The Asmodians are still around, you know. They've set up camp just south of the Fortress, and spend their days watching, waiting, plotting....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If any of them had the stomach for a fight, then perhaps I would respect them more. But that's hardly the Asmodian way, is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead they come in twos and threes, and just...observe! I can't stand it. I have half a mind to just attack their camp and be rid of them altogether.</p>

          <p>Well...I mean...are you sure? I don't want to put reckless thoughts into your mind, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, as misguided as those fools are, they're not stupid enough to leave small groups unless they're extremely well trained. A lone [%userclass] taking them on would have their work cut out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You would have to be at the peak of your abilities, my friend, with razor sharp reactions, Ariel's grace in every step, and Nezekan's shield at your side. If you are not prepared, then say so. There is no shame in realizing one's limits.</p>

          <p>So be it. You know the risks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must defeat the Asmodians and bring me those insignias they wear, I believe they call them [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1784a]s. Five of them should be all the evidence I need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now, [%username]. They may have seen you here, and may have anticipated an attack. Better to catch them off-guard than to charge into drawn swords.</p>

          <p>Well, I can't say I'll be glad to put up with more of their infernal spying, but at least I won't have a Daeva's blood on my hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go, [%username]. I need to document the Asmodian movements over the last few days. The last thing I need now is more distractions.</p>

          <p>So you were equal to the task! Outstanding work, [%username]--you managed to attain victory even though you were greatly outnumbered, and there's barely a scratch on you.</p>
