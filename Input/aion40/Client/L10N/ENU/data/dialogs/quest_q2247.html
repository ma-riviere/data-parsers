          <p>Well... It's... It's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2247a]. Looking like this, I don't dare leave the village. Not everyone is as understanding as you.</p>

          <p>Some time ago, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF1_13] happened by. I asked if he'd obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2247a] for me.</p>

          <p>He's already been paid--all you have to do is pick them up. He's usually camped at lake's edge. Tell him "Long-Ears" sent you.</p>
