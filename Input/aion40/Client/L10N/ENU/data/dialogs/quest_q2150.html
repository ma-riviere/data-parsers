          <p>Have you been to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Combine_Rookie]? Are you going there? Do you know my brother, Nowlan?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Heh, I should probably slow down and explain, right? Well, we used to manage the Fast-Track Server together, but then we fought. Well, we always fought, but this time it seemed bigger than all the other times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I can't even remember what it was about. Stupid, huh? Well, I'd like to find out if he's still mad at me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you get the chance, will you go and ask him? It's easy to get there. Just go to "Menu," then "Go to Channel," and then "Go to Fast-Track Server."</p>

          <p>Sorry, I know I'm a bit half-hearted about my speech, but Rian was the one who always used to do that. I'm no good at people.</p>

          <p>Ugh, he was always so childish. I suppose he's fishing for an apology. I don't know what I've got to apologize for.</p>
