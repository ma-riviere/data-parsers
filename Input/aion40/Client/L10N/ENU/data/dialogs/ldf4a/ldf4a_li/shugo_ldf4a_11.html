          <p>Lucachinerk heard about fancy coins found only in Sarpan, so came right over. But Kahrun's Symbols not very pretty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lucky thing, though--they are easy to get! So able to trade them for Radiant Tokens I really want.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What is so good about Kahrun's Symbols, anyway? Not very nice-looking, and they are everywhere....</p>
