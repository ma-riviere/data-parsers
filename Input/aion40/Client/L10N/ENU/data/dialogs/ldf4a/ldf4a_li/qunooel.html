          <p>The Reians have a strange outlook, compared to us. I suppose it comes from being isolated in Balaurea all this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are one unified people, and don't even seem to understand why we are the way we are.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is theirs a better outlook? Who can say? Are they truly prepared for war against the Balaur, or even the Asmodians?</p>
