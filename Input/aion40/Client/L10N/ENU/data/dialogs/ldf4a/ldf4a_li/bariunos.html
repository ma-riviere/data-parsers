          <p>I suppose you've given sufficient thought to the Stigma you want before you came to see me here?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's important because Stigma can change a Daaeva's very destiny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take extra caution when choosing. Consider those souls of our ancestors and the divinity they hold.</p>

          <p>You must've underestimated the totality of Stigma--what it is and what it does.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm gifted with an innate sense for it. I am a self-taught Stigma master. An exception, to be sure, for most Daevas require training in their use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seek out advice from those Daevas around you who are already proficient at handling Stigma.</p>
