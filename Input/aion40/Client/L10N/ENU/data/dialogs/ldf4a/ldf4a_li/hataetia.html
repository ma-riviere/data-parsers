          <p>I can understand if you need to be away from this place, [%username]. My Asmodian counterpart makes me a little nervous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the other locations I can send you to are just as hostile, though for different reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, we do what must be done for Elysea and Lady Ariel. Where do you wish to go?</p>

          <p>This is a world of great peril. Every step you take sends you deeper and deeper into chaos and fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you are strong and carry the light, you cannot fail. Lady Ariel will protect you.</p>

          <p>I regret to inform you that I cannot let you teleport right now.</p>

          <p>I am surprised you have come this far without the ability to do so, but you seem like an ambitious Daeva indeed.</p>

          <p>You should do what you must, then return to me. Then I will be able to assist you.</p>
