          <p>I won't lie: I don't particularly like foreigners.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you started showing up, we've been deluged with merchants, soul healers, and warehouse managers; troops and caravans trample everything in their path; the incessant battle threatens civilians on a daily basis. Garldar Village has become a blasted military base camp! </p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may say it's unavoidable, but I've lived in this village since long before you showed up. I find it a change for the worse.</p>
