          <p>A Cube is a mysterious object, but you can't just keep putting items in it indefinitely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Warehouse is not an unlimited resource, either, but it gives you more options that just your Cube alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When your Cube is full, just let me know. I'll keep your items with utmost care. You won't regret it.</p>
