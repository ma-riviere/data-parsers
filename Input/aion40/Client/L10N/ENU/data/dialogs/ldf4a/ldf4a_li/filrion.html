          <p>Greetings. I am responsible for evaluating Ancient Icons and compensating the Daevas who bring them to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These are sacred objects, as you should know. It's sacrilege to let the Balaur or their fiends keep them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not fear. I will be impartial, and your reward will be fair.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, did you mistake me for someone who handles another kind of Ancient item?</p>

          <p>I only deal with Ancient Icons, and you do not have any.</p>
