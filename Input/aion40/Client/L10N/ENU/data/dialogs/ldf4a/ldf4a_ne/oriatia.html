          <p>The power to counter Siel's Relics is greater than even a Daevic mind can bear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It begs to be used, keens from within the chambers of your heart to be unleashed. But it does not discriminate between good and ill. You must not bow to it, let it direct you.</p>
