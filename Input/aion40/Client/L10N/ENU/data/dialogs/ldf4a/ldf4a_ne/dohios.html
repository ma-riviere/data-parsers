          <p>It's hard being in a place like this, where nature has been torn apart and exploited by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were charged with protecting Aion's creation, not ripping it to shreds in their mad lust for power!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To think this area was once filled with trees and birds and native animals.... It makes me sick to my stomach.</p>
