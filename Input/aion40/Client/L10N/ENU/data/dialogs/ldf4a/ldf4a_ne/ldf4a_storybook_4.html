          <p>Archeology requires patience and analysis, not the querulous fighting instincts of an adventurer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Suited to my profession, then, I may be a Daeva, but all the advantage that gives me is long life and the strength to go where Humans cannot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My purpose is not to fight the Balaur or to go on epic quests. This may seem frivolous in these times of war, but understanding the past can help solve our problems in the present.</p>

          <p>Case in point: I was one of the first Reians to make an in-depth study into the northeast region of Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I led the excavation of the Crumbling Petralith, initially discovered when a patrol found a massive finger joint in the Jotari Wastes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was an exciting time; the existence of a Petralith here in Sarpan was astonishing. Back then, the Debarim Petralith Studio was still buried and dormant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did Aion's forces fight here at one time? What caused their defeat? Such questions could help us in the present day, so Kamar gave full support to my expedition.</p>

            <p>During excavation, several mysteries popped up. First, one of my assistants discovered a series of ring-shaped structures.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Given our incomplete knowledge of Petralith structure at the time, we naturally assumed that these were just more scattered parts.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>However, close examination revealed that these rings were made at a completely different time, over a separation of hundreds of years.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Puzzled, I assigned a few assistants to examine these odd rings while the rest continued work on the Petralith.</p>

        <body>
           <p>It wasn't long before we made a second discovery: a strange device buried not far from where we found the rings.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>This device could only be described as a large chunk of carved crystal set into a plinth.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>We found no runes or signs anywhere nearby. What could it do?</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>We attempted to activate the device with pressure, magic, Aether, and the other usual methods. None of these were successful.</p>

           <p>Just as mysterious as its purpose was its origin. Where did it come from? Who could've built it, in resource-poor and Aether-starved Sarpan?</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>I pondered these puzzles while continuing to excavate the Petralith. It, at least, we had some knowledge about.</p>
           <p> </p>
	         <p>However, events were about to force my hand, and lead me to the discovery of my career.</p>

          <p>Even then, the Jotari Wastes were obviously a dangerous place. We could not enter without several Daevas as protection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Further, Kahrun, concerned for our safety, ordered us not to spend too much consecutive time at the excavation site.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This slowed our work, but Kahrun believed it was preferable to losing scholars to marauding monsters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it turned out, his fears were entirely justified.</p>

          <p>We were hours from finishing our latest cycle and heading back to Kamar when the alarm rang out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before I continue, I must remark that I find Tyrhunds fascinating creatures, for what I hope are obvious reasons. I would dearly like to explore in-depth their structural resemblance to Petralith hands someday.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their affinity for the Balaur is also interesting. Did the Balaur build them, or train them like Worgs?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I thought of none of these things when a horde of them, along with some vicious Zanthays, descended upon our worksite.</p>

          <p>The battle was soon joined. The bodyguards Kahrun had sent ordered us to flee while they engaged the enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>I, of course, was the last archeologist to evacuate, after all my assistants and colleagues got out safely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, by the time I could make a run for it, our bodyguards had been overwhelmed and Tyrhunds had broken through their lines.</p>
          <p> </p>
         	<p>They quickly skittered towards me, cutting off my escape routes. I was trapped.</p>

          <p>Now, as I said before, I am not an adventurer or a legionary. But I can defend myself. When you go into the places I do, you have to know a thing or two about battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I drew my bow and fired at the encroaching horde, hoping to buy time for my bodyguards to come to my aid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some foes fell, but others pressed onward. As they drew nearer, I switched to my twin daggers and brought more down. But I could not destroy them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the Tyrhunds reared up, and the shadows of its massive fingers descended upon me.</p>

          <p>I barely managed to dodge. The attack instead shattered the crystal in the strange device we'd found.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With a massive rumble, the sand shifted beneath my feet, and the stone rings rose into the air. They glowed with power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I, and perhaps even the Tyrhunds, watched in awe as a windstream blew through the rings, stretching out into the distance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I didn't know where the windstream went, but I had little choice. My bodyguards were busy with their own battles. I was surrounded.</p>

          <p>I ran onto the outcropping above me, spread my wings, and jumped into the windstream. I hurtled over the desert at dizzying speeds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It whisked me higher and higher, until I found myself above a set of small islands in the sky, unreachable with a Daeva's wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>The windstream ended, and I dropped onto one of these islands. Kalgolems waited everywhere, maintaining a silent vigil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was then I realized: these islands had to be supported by SOME force, the Kalgolems protecting SOMETHING. Perhaps if I ordered an excavation of the land directly below....</p>

          <p>I made it back to Kamar alive, of course. And you must recognize that this is the story of how I discovered the Jotari Sanctuary Ruins and Debarim Petralith Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I discuss more of their wonders and perils later in this book. My only regret is that this momentous find drew me away from the Petralith and the windstream creator who made it possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The so-called "Ancient Windstream Activator" regenerated its crystal, confirming its function. But we are still no closer to knowing its origins and original purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only hope I have inspired future generations of scholars to take up where I left off, to solve this mystery once and for all.</p>
