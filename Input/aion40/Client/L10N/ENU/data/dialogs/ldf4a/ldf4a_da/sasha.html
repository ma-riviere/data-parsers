          <p>This is a place where most don't understand the meaning of neutrality. Well, let me tell you. Neutrality means you act in a fair and impartial manner with no bias against anyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The question is, who keeps the neutrality in this neutral area? No one. Everyone is too busy to take what they're after for their own race.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't call this place neutral.</p>
