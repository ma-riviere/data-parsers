          <p>Just tell me where you're going, and zoom, thwip, swish, I'll send you right along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't hurt... very much. Ha! Just kidding.</p>

          <p>Whew, there are still those who don't know that only Daevas can use teleport devices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, it wouldn't be easy for so many reasons for a Human to live in a city built for Daevas, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, since Humans can't use the power of Aether, they cannot use this teleport device.</p>
