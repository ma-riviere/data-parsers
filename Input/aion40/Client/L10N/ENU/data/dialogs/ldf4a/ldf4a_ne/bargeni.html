          <p>Despite Kahrun's efforts, tensions still run high, and not just among the Elyos and Asmodians.</p>

          <p>Even Reians are becoming restless and snappish. We judge the Elyos and Asmodians for their aggression, but are we any better?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This just makes peace amongst all Atreians even more important. If we are to win against the Balaur, we must do it together.</p>
