          <p>When we first settled Sarpan, the Humnaz were hardly a threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole tribe was just a few overgrown Porguses with short tempers and bad eyesight. We could've wiped them out, easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we are not the Balaur. There is space in Sarpan for all of Aion's creatures, if they behave.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>While the Humnaz kept to their side of the territorial lines, we let them be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now? The tribe is huge, and powerful. And they're pushing into our land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We should've killed them when we had the chance.</p>
