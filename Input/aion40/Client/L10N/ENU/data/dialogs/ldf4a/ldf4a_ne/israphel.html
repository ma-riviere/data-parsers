          <p>You will come and go. You will fail and you will succeed. You will die. You will be reborn. You will roll with the tides, a single grain of sand amongst millions.</p>

          <p>Atreia fell, [%username]. It broke apart at the seams. I played a part in that. I mattered. You did not.</p>
