          <p>This spear and I have been through many battles together. I've polished blood off of it more times than I can recall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at how it shines! It's almost a shame I'm assigned to refugee work now; it doesn't get nearly as much of a workout as it used to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, well, I suppose it doesn't matter. We do a lot of good right here, without the slaughter.</p>
