          <p>I once loved a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know... when I met him, he was already married to a Human... had children even.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought I could compromise, and stand aside for the single lifetime he and his family would have together. He knew of my love for him, and we promised to meet here, once his family had passed.</p>

          <p>What happened? Hah. His Human wife ascended as a Daeva... an elderly woman for all time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He won't leave her now. My love is lost to a guilty conscience. I am heartbroken.</p>
