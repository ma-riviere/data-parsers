          <p>The Trepone Villages used to be one of the safest parts of Sarpan, guarded by mountains and the nearness of Kamar's soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, we had our challenges, and the forests were never completely safe. But now... it's hard to imagine how we will ever feel secure again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luman and Menin were not full of soldiers, or secrets, or weapons. They were farming villages, full of families. That the Balaur should intentionally target civilians... it is unspeakable, what they have done.</p>
