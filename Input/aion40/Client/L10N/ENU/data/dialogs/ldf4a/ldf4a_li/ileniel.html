          <p>There are many Elyos who are hostile to the idea of peace with the Asmodians, but I can't understand that point of view.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What did the Seraphim Lords make a stand for, if not peace? And with the Balaur, whom we all agree must be stopped?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that the Asmodians aren't wrong, but how can we say that Lady Ariel was right and reject peace with our enemies at the same time?</p>
