          <p>You know, being this handsome can be a terrible burden. We have Asmodians snarling at us like wild animals, the Balaur waiting for the slightest miscalculation on our part...and yet, most of my problems are much closer to home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the ladies, of course. All it takes is a polite smile or nod of acknowledgement and I find myself beset with declarations of love!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I appreciate beauty as much as the next Daeva, but in one instance it became too much. She thought we were more than we were...her jealousy...</p>

          <p>Ah, Simunai. We met in Eltnen and fell in love immediately. She was as beautiful as the land itself, but her temper... Oh, it was terrible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I spoke to another woman--even a trader--she would become blind with rage and jealousy. Oh, she'd throw things, kick things. It was awful.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The trouble is that she's a Lepharist now. I wouldn't normally say this... I'm not some crazy person...but maybe you should just...you know...eliminate her.</p>
