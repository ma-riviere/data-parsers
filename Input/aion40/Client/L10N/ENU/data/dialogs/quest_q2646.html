          <p>I came across a man hiding at a hunter's abandoned campsite. I asked him who he was, but his reply was confusing. He asked me, "How many white hairs does a White Hair Kurin have?" I told him I didn't know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Isn't that strange? He didn't seem quite right.</p>

          <p>I tried to learn more, but all I got from him was his name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His presence is a mystery, but I guess he can stay there if he wants. Still, I worry. Why was he hiding alone in such a dangerous place? He seemed to have some purpose, but he wasn't willing to say a word to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you please investigate? You're so well known, [%username], he may talk to you.</p>
