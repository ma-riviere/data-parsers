          <p>The biggest threat facing Eltnen is the desert itself. It's consuming Eltnen acre by acre, and we're powerless to stop it.</p>

          <p>Once these lands were fertile, but now...many have fled. Only the stubborn and the hardy remain...and me, I suppose.</p>

          <p>Lady Yustiel created the Mystic Springs so that life could flourish even in Eltnen's arid regions. But since Aether is draining out of the world, the desert is expanding and many Mystic Springs have dried up. Curse the Cataclysm!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Daevas of Earth are supposed to manage the Mystic Springs, but there aren't enough of us to stand against the desert itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To restore the dried-up Mystic Springs, we need help...your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ophelos] at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G2_SUB_1] says he has a theory about the Mystic Springs. He's been trying for months to figure out how they work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Work with him to restore the Mystic Spring of Laquepin.  If you pass the Manduri Forest and the Outpost Ruins, you will see the Spring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Ophelos is right, we may be able to employ his technique across Eltnen. Now go, and may the sun warm the earth at your feet.</p>

          <p>Gaia said that she would send someone to help us...but I had no idea it'd be you, [%username]. Your reputation precedes you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The trick to restoring the Mystic Springs is to understand how they work in the first place. There's a Life Stone at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G2_SUB_1], and that's where the clean water flows from.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Life Stone contains [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1035a]s, the source of its power, but the Drakes came and took the Life Beads. No beads, no water--it's that simple.</p>

          <p>But the remedy is clear: Go to the Drake Habitat, get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Drake_28_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Drake_30_An]s, and bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1035a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, put the beads in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF2_Fountain_Q1300_A] over there. If I'm right, clean water will flow from the Mystic Spring once more. </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>He was on duty in the watchtower and saw the Mystic Spring dry up over the course of just a few days. I contacted the Daevas of Earth about it, but we have other issues to deal with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know only what I put in my report, so talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Corybantes], and he can point you in the right direction. </p>

          <p>Even from here, it was obvious that something was going on. To get there, just follow the road to the right of the watchtower, then go straight ahead and you'll reach the Spring. </p>
