          <p>I'm just so happy to have a chance to chat with you. You don't mind, do you? It's the first thing in ages to take my mind off the pain. </p>

          <p>Of course. Some pains live beyond death. I'm sure if your spirit goes to the flow of Aether, everything's fine, but for those of us trapped here....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are ways to ease this pain, of course. Things that make it better are hard to get, though, when you're always being attacked. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'll go get what I need, I'll make sure you see Bollvig straight away. Do we have a bargain?</p>

          <p>I can't believe my good fortune that you happened along. Very well, I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2652a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2652b].</p>

          <p>The Muddy Elemental Water comes from  [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater3_43_An]s on the Stenon Bay. The best Bloodwing Fluid, on the other hand, is gotten from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BATRe2_44_An]s living in the Drake Temple Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are some other items we'll need too, but let's focus on these for now.</p>
