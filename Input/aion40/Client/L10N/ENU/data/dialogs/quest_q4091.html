          <p>Do you have family, Daeva?</p>

          <p>I do...or did. A brother and sister. They had the best jobs around--they both worked in the castle.</p>

          <p>Then the epidemic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never saw them again after Lord Lannok ordered the castle gates shut. I was locked outside, and thought my days were up, only I never got sick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I survived, and the others perished.</p>

          <p>Near enough. The chances of them surviving when nearly everyone here became undead are, well...impossible. I'd sooner think they slipped away than cling to such an unlikely hope.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I want now is for someone to go back to the Castle and release my brother and sister. They don't deserve what's happened to them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you mind doing it for me? I couldn't face seeing them again, not like that.</p>
