          <p>[%username], your progress has been truly amazing, but clearly you've had a bit of help on your journey thus far. You'll need more for the trials ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It isn't enough to arm yourself for the trial ahead, you must also protect yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Your mission to Karamatis requires a tremendously powerful spell of protection. First, go meet Daminu, Lodas, and Arbolu and get their blessings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next, meet the Aetheric Field Protectors, then the Daevas with special abilities. Have them each bless this marble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a long journey, I know, but it should be rewarding for you and them. Just as when you got your first ring in Sanctum, you'll draw strength from us all.</p>
