          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_10] is a relic left behind by the Balaur, who used to rule this place.</p>

          <p>The altar has its own power, even now. It affects both plants and creatures that get too close to it.</p>

          <p>There's good fishing near the Altar of Tiamat. The gatherers can pull in quite a haul in a short amount of time, so there are many who are willing to take the risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They ignore our warnings, go fishing near the altar, and end up getting attacked by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SlimeD_14_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since this keeps happening, Nokir has decided that since we can't stop the gatherers from going, we're going to have to sweep up the Slimes near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_10].</p>
