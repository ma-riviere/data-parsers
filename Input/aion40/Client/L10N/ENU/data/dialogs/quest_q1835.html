	<p>You have an Ancient Goblet for me, I hope? Seen more than enough Daevas wandering by looking for nothing more than conversation.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Do I look like a counsellor? Is there something about me that says, "Come talk to me about all your problems?" Hmm?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Either pass me a Goblet and let me get on with my job, or leave me be. I've paperwork to do.</p>

	<p>Well, I...I should apologise. Let me see what you've brought.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Hmm. Well, it is made from gold, that much is true, though it has been crushed almost flat. I'd wager some clumsy Balaur fiend stepped on the thing. Wouldn't be the first time.</p>

	<p>Well, what can I say? I'm sorry, [%username], my frustrations are not without reason, though.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Now let's look at this Goblet. Hmm...the condition is fairly good, and here you can still read some of the engravings. I'll send it back to Sanctum--perhaps our restoration staff can undo some of the damage done.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Your Abyss Points are well deserved, [%userclass].</p>

	<p>Well...yes, I believe it may well be! I...I should apologize!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>And my...what a sample! The gold is nearly flawless, the inscriptions are almost entirely legible, and it's quite a hefty piece to boot.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>This is exactly the type of sample that Sanctum needs, [%username].</p>

	<p>My! Just...just look at it!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The thought of something so glorious being piled up alongside actual junk sickens me to my core. But now is not the time to complain--we have one of our great treasures back in our hands, and all thanks to you.</p>

	<p>Well, I could take that, but you wouldn't like it. See, I can't give you any more Abyss Points for now, but if you get stronger, or lose points somehow, I can do the trade then.</p>

	<p>I wonder why the Balaur are so interested in keeping our ancient artifacts. Research would be the most obvious answer, but are those bestial nightmares even intelligent enough for that?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>So many questions, and we'll likely never know the answers. Still, recovering our treasures is key, so please bring me others as you find them.</p>

	<p>I told you, I have no time for this! Waltzing up here and pretending that you have items for me helps no one. You have nothing even resembling an Ancient Goblet, [%username]!</p>
