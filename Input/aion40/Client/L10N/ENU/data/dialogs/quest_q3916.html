          <p>My research indicates Dragel and Drazma, the chief mutagenic agents, are made from a substance called Drana.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur are producing Drana, Aion knows how. It vexes me that everything is a mystery.</p>

          <p>You're familiar with the area already. Could you also procure the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3916a]s?</p>

          <p>Gather some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3916a]s, and we'll make real progress on these questions.</p>

          <p>Look, it's a simple equation. If I don't have Drana samples, I can't find the remodeling mechanism, and we can't save Elysea.</p>

          <p>So this is Drana. They make Dragel and Drazma from this? I wonder how...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only hitch I see is it may require more samples to complete this study.</p>

          <p>Let me get the ball rolling on this study. I'll probably have more work for you shortly. Don't go far.</p>
