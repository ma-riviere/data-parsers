          <p>Sparkles live in the same areas as Plumas, and they eat the same food. Both animals prey on smaller insects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Recently, the Sparkles have increased in number, and must be exhausting the food supply.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we reduce the number of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spakle_19_n]s, it should restore the balance.</p>
