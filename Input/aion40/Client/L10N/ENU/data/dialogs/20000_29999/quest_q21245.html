          <p>Now that I know where the Naduka Biolab is, I can finally begin my work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the Balaur are very advanced in many ways. They have knowledge and capabilities we have no conception of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we could get our hands on it, we could learn from it, counteract it, adapt it for our own use!</p>

          <p>Oh, it is, it is! The potential is limitless! The Dramata Chasers probably just want to destroy it.... Oh, what a waste that would be!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C5_Lab] and steal a research journal. It should contain all sorts of notes on their current projects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd go myself, but I couldn't bear it if Itar was hurt while I was gone. In the name of knowledge, I beg you!</p>

          <p>I suggest you proceed with caution. Stir too much of a ruckus, and they might just choose YOU as their next experimental subject.</p>

          <p>I don't know what's in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C5_Lab], but you'll recognize a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21245a] when you see it.</p>

          <p>Hmm. It sounds like you did quite a bit of damage to their operation. I am both pleased and somewhat upset.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, well, there should be plenty of equipment left intact. That alone could tell us much. I'll need some time to translate this journal, though. I wonder when I should tell Itar about this, if ever...?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, [%username]. I apologize, I forgot you were there. Your efforts on my behalf deserve reward. And I'll credit you in my next paper!</p>
