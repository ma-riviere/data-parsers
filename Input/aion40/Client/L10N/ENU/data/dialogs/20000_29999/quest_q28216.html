          <p>Did you know that Lord Marchutan's decision to open the Crucibles to regular Daevas has already produced great results?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our troops are fighting better than ever against the Balaur, and according to reports, most of the best have proven themselves in the Crucibles. We've earned a lot of goodwill, even from the other Lords, who didn't initially support the plan.</p>

          <p>It certainly is! Lord Marchutan has decided to reward the Crucible participants who work hard for good results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm in charge of distributing the rewards. I'm honored and all, but it's not as if I needed another job. Anyway, you can do me a favor by listening carefully to exactly how many Insignias I need, and not bothering me until you have them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me see... 400 Courage Insignias and 9800 Crucible Insignias will get you one Platinum Medal. I'm sure that's not too much for a Daeva like you.</p>

          <p>Your loss, not mine. Still, I'll be here if you change your mind. And I hope you do change your mind, because we're still in need of skilled Daevas to fight Tiamat's army, and the Crucibles are really the best place to practice.</p>

          <p>Yes, that's the right number. Thank goodness I can weigh them rather than having to count them all! We used to have to do that. Those were...tedious times.</p>
