          <p>Oh, khepsab! The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21506_1] came to me, but it was supposed to be delivered to the Herbalist's Camp!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And half of the shattering ice in the box has melted already. The supplies will start going bad once all the ice melts. I can't let this happen on my watch... but blast it all, I have to finish taking inventory, here.</p>
          <p> </p>        
          <p>Would you deliver this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lisola] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1_01]? BEFORE the ice melts? And in Sarpan's climate, that won't be long from now!.</p>

          <p>Oh, the Feena Box! The whole campsite has been waiting for this with bated breath. Without your help, it surely would have gone bad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Iros is so good at his job. I don't know where we'd be without his coordination skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you so much, [%username]! You've been a tremendous help.</p>

          <p>Iros in Garldar Village told you the Feena Box he got was supposed to be delivered to Lisola. He asked you to deliver it for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The box apparently contained cooking ingredients that would spoil without ice, so in this crazy Sarpan heat, you had to deliver it as quickly as you could. You managed to succeed, though you were exhausted by the effort.</p>
