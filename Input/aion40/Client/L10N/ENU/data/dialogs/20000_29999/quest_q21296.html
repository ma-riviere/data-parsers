          <p>I have just one more request for you, and don't worry--you won't have to go back into Padmarashka's Cave.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I sort of kept hold of one of the Dramata spawn pulled out of that cave. I know, I know, probably a bad idea, but it presented itself as such a great opportunity for study. Thing is, I don't think I have the background I need to understand it before it hatches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to take it to a Dramata Chaser like [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Batalrion]. He can get the information in time, and destroy it before it becomes a threat. Don't worry--it's pretty far from hatching at this point.</p>

          <p>I was hoping to get the chance to study this myself, but I've learned my lesson. I'd rather let an expert see it than risk messing things up by trying to keep it for myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Batalrion] is probably going to be thrilled to see this. Except for the Protectors, not even most Balaur ever get to see a Dramata spawn!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you're done, please go and tell Agent [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hler] the whole story--yes, even the part where I messed up.</p>

          <p>Come on, you helped me with the difficult bit. This bit's easy in comparison! Plus, you get to look good in front of the Dramata Chaser and the Agent.</p>
