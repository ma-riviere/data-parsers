          <p>Down, down, down you go. Through the center of the world, out the other side, and still falling through the starfields.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unable to control your descent. Unable to breathe. Alone.</p>

          <p>Now that I can see what's happening in Raksang, that nightmare's been coming to me every night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw the signs, of course, and tried to warn my people and yours...but no one listened. Scholarly status be balfired.</p>

          <p>The Synthral Wardens have been mining that Ore Stratum for a long time. So long that the ground can barely support their weight. And they're just spirits! We must stop this.</p>

          <p>Reian Seismologist Kenros said that Raksang verges on catastrophic collapse. The cause is millenia of mining by Balaur, who didn't stop even when turned to ghosts!</p>
