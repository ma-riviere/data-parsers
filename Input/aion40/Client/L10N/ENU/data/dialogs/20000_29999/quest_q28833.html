          <p>The first step in learning more about a plant is to study its sprouts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the only thing we know about Blooms is that if many people fertilize a Guestbloom, one or two sprouts shoot up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's the reason our research hasn't made much progress. All research requires samples. How can you make progress without samples?</p>

          <p>I haven't seen a fresh sprout for a long time!</p>

          <p>It shines beautifully. With proper care, it will grow into a beautiful seedling.</p>

          <p>I'll study the sprout thoroughly to find out even more about Blooms. Thank you so much.</p>
