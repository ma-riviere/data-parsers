          <p>I've heard some Daeva say a Chanter can't heal their allies as well as a Cleric...hah! I say that Daeva never met you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Chanters are the backbone of the Asmodian army. After all, they allow their allies to perform feats of strength and magic that wouldn't have otherwise been possible, and they pick up the slack when a Cleric can't do the job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple of Destiny has recently recognized the contributions of all Asmodian Chanters, and sent me a number of Greater Stigma to reward the most dedicated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can use Greater Stigma, right, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Why did I even bother asking? Of course you can! A Chanter of your talent would be well aware of the benefits Greater Stigma provide in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's your lucky day, because I am prepared to reward you with a new Greater Stigma direct from the Temple of Destiny. If...you can pass a little test.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>You've got guts, [%username]. It's not many who will walk into the unknown--I like that in a Chanter. Even without your allies, you're ready to take on whatever challenges I can dish out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well then...I wish I had prepared something a little more difficult! But I suppose if you finish this quickly there will be more time to test out your new Greater Stigma on the Balaur and the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need to do is master a Greater Stigma. Let's see...I think *** will do just fine. Use *** 10 times and then return to me.</p>
