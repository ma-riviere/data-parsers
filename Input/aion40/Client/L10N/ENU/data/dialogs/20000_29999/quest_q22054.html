        <body>
          <p>I'm supposed to brief you on the situation in Basilika Cavern, [%username]. If you've been there, you'll already know that a long tunnel runs from Blue Quartz Valley to the Gurriki Grotto.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where the tunnel passes beneath the Eye, it opens up into an enormous cavern. There are powerful Artifacts down there under heavy Balaur guard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We want to control those artifacts, but they're currently held by the Elyos [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q22054all]s. I want you to go down there and tear the Artifacts from their soft, clawless hands.</p>

          <p>That's what I wanted to hear.</p>

          <p>Holding a dominant position over the Elyos is vital to our ultimate success in Tiamaranta. The more Artifacts we have, the more control we have over the battle.</p>
