          <p>Have you ever encountered a ghost called Gatz the Wise? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was a great leader in life, and a good friend. Compassionate, thoughtful, brave almost to the point of rashness....</p>

          <p>He was. That's why we were so stunned when he fell in battle.</p>

          <p>No. But that is why we could not lift a hand against him, even when his ghost started to attack us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We thought it was better to see him like that than not be able to see him at all. But now I see our selfishness.</p>
