          <p>I see you still have the Piece of Zikel. That's not surprising--the odds of you having the skills needed to use it were very slim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I didn't give it to you so it would just sit in your Cube looking pretty. I know someone who can fulfill the Piece's purpose. Would you like to know who?</p>

          <p>Her name is Usener. Perhaps you met her the last time you were in Pandaemonium?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, she will definitely be able to enhance Athana's Sword. I wouldn't have given it to you had I not known anyone who could.</p>

          <p>From what I understand, the process is painstaking and expensive. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener] will probably need you to pay a great deal of Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe the results will be well worth the expenditure. Again, I would not have given a reward that would prove useless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that you know all the factors involved, are you still going to go see her?</p>

          <p>Good. I expected you would realize that in a war like this, any increase in strength could potentially be the difference between life and death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if it turns out that you need more Kinah, it's wise to at least hear what Usener has to say.</p>

          <p>I know Kinah doesn't grow on trees, but doesn't the prospect of greater strength at least intrigue you?</p>

          <p>Are you kidding? Only the most legendary smiths have even seen a Piece of Zikel, much less worked with one!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still.... I don't know if Athana told you about this, but this process will require a great deal of rare materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to ask you for 8,000,000 Kinah to pay for them. I know that's a lot, but when you see the results, you'll agree that it was worth it.</p>
