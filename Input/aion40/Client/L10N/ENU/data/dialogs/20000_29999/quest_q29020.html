          <p>Oh, don't look at me like that--I'm just joking. Although you are one of the worthiest students I've ever had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, Tailoring is a vast, deep skill that reaches new depths of complexity every time someone spins. I think you're ready to explore those depths further.</p>

          <p>I actually have two designs from which you could create [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_29020]. Neither can be used more than once, so be warned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One is cheaper, but takes more skill to get what you need. The other is more costly, but is guaranteed to give you the finest results on a successful crafting. Do you want to know more?</p>

          <p>This design is very basic. A lot of the complex stitching and color choices are left up to the Tailor.</p>

          <p>You may be able to create Agehia's Noble Sash from this design, but you might not. It depends on your confidence and skill.</p>

          <p>The only possible barrier is price--it costs 111,500 Kinah. Do you want to spend the money for near-guaranteed success?</p>
