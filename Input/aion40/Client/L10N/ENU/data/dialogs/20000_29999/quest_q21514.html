          <p>First we had to guard ourselves against the Balaur, a difficult task at the best of times. Then we were ordered to kill off the Leowasps, then the Serrators too. Now they want us to fight the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_SalivadoRed_58_An]s! With what? Our shoes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you help us, friend? They're found just north of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D].</p>
