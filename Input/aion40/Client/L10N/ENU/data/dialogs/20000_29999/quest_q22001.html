          <p>Shards! We're out of potions again?! Someone must be using them for stomachaches and minor cuts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this rate, we'll be useless in battle. Fortunately, I can make more myself until we get resupplied, but I'll need help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can use [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_22001a] from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Scorpion_Giant_58_An]s to make potions. I know it doesn't sound like it should work, but it does. If you could help get the poison, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

          <p>I swear by Aion, if I get my hands on whoever's chugging our potions, I'll...!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, one thing at a time. First, make potions. Then, find and strangle the potion waster.</p>

          <p>I've got everything together except the Scolopen's Poison. Did you bring some?</p>

          <p>Mmm, yes, it is a bit rank, isn't it? But that just means it's potent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The smell will go away once I dilute it and mix in the other ingredients. Which I'll do right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, [%username]. Oh, and if you catch the potion waster... displace him for me, will you?</p>

          <p>You killed Huge Desert Scolopens for their poison and brought it to Tokoma to mix into potions. He replaced his missing stock, but still held a grudge against whoever had wasted potions.</p>
