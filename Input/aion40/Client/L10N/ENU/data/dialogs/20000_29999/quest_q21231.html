          <p>Shards! The enemy is storming the Crimson Temple, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of my comrades are either bleeding on the battlefield or at an Obelisk. We need soldiers to retake the Crimson Temple, or Vorgaltem Citadel and Gelkmaros Fortress itself will be at risk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, I enjoy a bloodbath just as much as the next Asmodian, but not when we're in danger of losing our hold on Gelkmaros!</p>

          <p>We've got to retake the Crimson Temple. There's no other course of action.</p>

          <p>[%username], I need you to head to the temple and slaughter the guards. Take some dependable allies with you if possible, or it'll get messy.</p>

          <p>I've got another legion tasked with slaying the Guardian General, so you just need to concentrate on the guards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once the temple can be captured, attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_21231all], and kill as many as possible. When you've retaken the temple, report in to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cozett]--she should be in the area. </p>

          <p>Thank you. Without Daevas like you in Gelkmaros, we'd have no hope of wresting control from our enemies, or slaying Tiamat.</p>
