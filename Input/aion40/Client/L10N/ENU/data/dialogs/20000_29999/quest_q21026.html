          <p>Officially we're assisting Feles in her research of the region. Don't look so surprised--we can be smart as well as strong, you know!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In reality, though, we've been spending most of our time keeping Feles alive. Did she tell you she was attacked by a Strigik? That was a strong one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This whole blasted forest is full of hazards. And it's not just the Strigik!</p>

          <p>That's what I thought! But did you know there are Mosbear-like things and Moonflowers in Balaurea too? We've fought our share of those.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Mosbear_DR_51_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fellial_DR_51_An]s are seriously hampering our progress in numerous ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard of your reputation. Care to prove it by getting rid of some Bosbears and Moonflowers for us?</p>

          <p>You're as good as they say. Glad to hear it--we need more Daevas like you fighting for Asmodae.</p>

          <p>Now maybe we can actually assist Feles in some way other than keeping death at bay.</p>
