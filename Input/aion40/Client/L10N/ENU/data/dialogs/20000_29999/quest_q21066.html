          <p>Uh, pardon me...[%username]? I hope you don't mind me calling you by your name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard so much about you, so I'm sorry for being so nervous. You've done so much in such a short time, I...kind of want to be like you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...I was wondering if you could help me. I was surveying the Sunken Canyon recently, and, well....</p>

          <p>Well, see, it's a little embarrassing. A pack of Caltrops attacked me. I was alone at the time, so I fled to higher ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then this column of water suddenly burst from underneath me and flung me upward. If Niamela hadn't come by, I could've broken my neck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Later I found out that it was a geyser vent that caused me the trouble. I'm afraid someone else could get hurt by that thing. Could you help me find a way to plug it up?</p>

          <p>That's a relief. There's a naturalist here who might be able to help. What was her name...?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ightris]! That's right! She's just out front, below the stairs. Yes, the one with the tamed Mookies.</p>

          <p>Oh, my! Poor Jalg. One's first encounter with a geyser can be a dizzying experience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many such geysers in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A5_Under], as it's a volcanic area. But they are actually a boon to those in that region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Daevas actually travel to higher ground by standing in the geyser vent, and waiting for an eruption to lift them. I guess no one told him about that. Please assure him they are no danger to anyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, while you're here, perhaps you should pay [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gustava] a visit. He's something of a geologist, and should be able to point to the geyser.</p>

          <p>During an expedition to the Sunken Canyon, Jalg was swept up in a geyser eruption. Afraid that it was a danger to travelers, he asked you to help him find a way to destroy it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He suggested speaking with Ightris, a naturalist Daeva. When you approached her, she told you that geysers were no threat, but were actually used by Daevas to travel to otherwise unreachable areas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned to Jalg with this information, he was embarrassed but enlightened, noting that he could now use the geysers on future missions.</p>
