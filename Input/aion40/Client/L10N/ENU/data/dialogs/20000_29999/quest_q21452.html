          <p>You there, Daeva. Will you help me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am attempting to find a cure for Aether addiction, and I need to procure some rare ingredients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully one such as yourself does not suffer from this addiction? So many do....</p>

          <p>Hmm, so you were actually intelligent enough not to go inside Taloc or eat Taloc's Fruit without proper preparation. Incredible!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the reason I am still speaking with you is that I need you to run an errand. I heard a rumor going around Gelkmaros about a great Daeva who returned unharmed from inside Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently this person has done remarkable things in other lands, and is fated for more greatness here in Balaurea. Can help me find this Daeva named [%username]? Or are you too busy huffing Aether?</p>

          <p>Oh REALLY? Hah! Fine, I'll play along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>O mighty [%username], I believe I can cure Aether addiction by utilizing a poison from insects inside Taloc. The stronger the poison, the stronger the cure, and the most poisonous insect is the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_NeutWorkmanfly_Qeen_52_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course you know this already, great and powerful [%username]. All you need do is kill it and bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21452a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, would you like to attempt this and fail, or would you rather go find the real [%username] for me?</p>

          <p>If you can return with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21452a], then I suppose I must believe you are the [%username] I've heard so much about. Or else you got [%username] to do it for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, I get what I need--poisonous fluid extracted from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_NeutWorkmanfly_Qeen_52_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then I will be able to help poor, sun-addled souls like yourself.</p>

          <p>Did you at least get [%username] to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_NeutWorkmanfly_Qeen_52_Ae] for you? It's none of my concern as long as I obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21452a] I need.</p>

          <p>All I require is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21452a]. If you can't get it, get the real [%username] to recover the substance from inside Taloc. Then I can ease your madness.</p>

          <p>The Aether condensed in this tiny amount of fluid is immense. By combining this with an antidote, I can now manufacture a cure for Aether addiction.</p>
