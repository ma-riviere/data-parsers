          <p>Good, because an opportunity has come to put you to the test. I want to make an offering to High Priest Agehia at the Convent of Marchutan, and I want you to make that offering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may not be easy, but it'll prove your skills to anyone with half a brain.</p>

          <p>One is cheaper, but less likely you can make what you need from it. Other costs more Kinah, but probably saves Daeva time--a crafting success is guaranteed to produce Noble item. Which does Daeva wish to hear more about?</p>

          <p>It IS one of my better designs, isn't it? I'm quite proud of it. But every Handicrafter puts his or her unique mark on a creation.</p>
