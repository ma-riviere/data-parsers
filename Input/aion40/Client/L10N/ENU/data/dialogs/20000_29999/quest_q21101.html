          <p>Daeva, this is terrible! I used those boards to repair Mitta, but then I saw she broke a wheel!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And those boards you brought are the wrong kind of wood to fix it!</p>

          <p>What? Oh, never mind. There is wood proper to fix Mitta's wheel--[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21101a] from a very old Rotron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Rottentree_DR_NmdQ_54_An] is old enough to grow such wood.</p>
