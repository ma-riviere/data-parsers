		<p>Now...om...nom...nom nom...ouch! Hmmm...a fake coin would have been much softer, no doubt about it.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Well then, come to trade in some coins, have we! Looking for weapons no doubt! Yes...WEAPONS! No Gladiator or Templar is satisfied without an arsenal in their cube! I suppose there's also this armor...but...who needs to protect themselves when there is time for smashing?</p>

		<p>Yes! A new weapon is exactly what you need, [%username].</p>

		<p>There's nothing like that new weapon smell. Well...the smell of dried blood and innards has its merits, but it's that "just forged" scent that makes all the carnage worth it.</p>

		<p>Now, how about those 1800 Mithril coins?</p>
