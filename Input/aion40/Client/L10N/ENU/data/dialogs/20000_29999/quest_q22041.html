          <p>Mustan told you that extra supplies would be needed now that friendly forces had taken control of the Heart of Gravity. Those extra supplies would obviously need to be stored, meaning an extra warehouse needed to be built.</p>

          <p>You destroyed Gravity Well Mugolems, gathering the stone from them to be used in the warehouse's construction.</p>
