          <p>My main research project is about improving the performance of flowerpots by using special crystals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When my research succeeds, you can grow whatever you want in a flowerpot. The research is still in the early stages, though. I haven't gotten very far because, frankly, I don't have enough of the crystals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you obtain a Spring Crystal, a Summer Crystal, a Fall Crystal, and a Winter Crystal, please bring them to me. You will be well rewarded for your efforts.</p>

          <p>There always seems to be one crystal missing, which slows down my research. I reward Daevas handsomely for bringing me all four crystals, but it's still hard to get them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have the crystals, please give them to me. You will be pleased with my reward. I promise.</p>

          <p>There's the Spring Crystal, the Summer Crystal, the Fall Crystal, and the Winter Crystal. You collected all of them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, this is the gift I promised. It's more valuable than it looks. If you take good care of this flowerpot, you will find yourself well rewarded for your work here.</p>
