          <p>I'm not as obsessed as Kaisa with heat, but I have to admit, those Steam Springs are pretty soothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the only time I get to feel them is while I'm fighting [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Starturtle_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Foam_Spring_58_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, I'd bet if there were less of those, I'd get to enjoy the hot water for a little while--relax without having to worry about...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, [%username]! I have a very... important mission for you. Fine, you can guess what it is. Can you do it anyway?</p>

          <p>I know it may seem reckless to try to relax in the middle of a Dragon Lord's territory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But frankly, if we don't take every chance at a little luxury we can get, we'll go mad from worry and fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Killing those creatures will indirectly improve morale for us all. I hope you succeeded.</p>

          <p>Thanks to you, we'll all be able to wash away some of the tension and stress occasionally.</p>

          <p>I, of course, will be first, considering the whole thing was my idea.</p>
