          <p>I've spoken to Feles in the Strigik Forest. I thought she might have some insight in how to wrangle the Mookies, as she's an ecologist and all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took a while, but I just got her reply.</p>

          <p>She says that Mookies tend to congregate around a single figure and follow it wherever it goes. Apparently, this poke has a leader which she called Wildspine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they're so determined to stay in this area, it must mean Wildspine's made this place its home.</p>

          <p>Well, the reply went on...and on...and on. About their social structure, diet, courtship habits, and Aion knows what else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was very interesting to a point, but after a while your eyes start glazing over. Must be riveting to her fellow researchers, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, she said that once [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fungy_DR_NmdQ_52_An] is gone, the other Mookies will move on. Could you help one more time?</p>

          <p>Well, Feles said that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fungy_DR_NmdQ_52_An] shouldn't stray too far from the rest of the poke. If you search in areas where the other Mookies tend to be, you should run across it sooner or later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for the help--I'm oddly a bit reluctant to kick the little guys out for some reason.</p>

          <p>Good. The rest of the Mookies should move on by themselves now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As will I, soon enough. The only thing to do now is make arrangements. Maybe I can still keep up with Angrad....</p>

          <p>But that's none of your concern. Thanks again.</p>

          <p>Vesvola sought advice from ecologist Feles and was told that Mookies are easy to disperse with once their leader is gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You hunted down the Mookie leader, Wildspine. When you returned, Vesvola wistfully thanked you and gave you a reward.</p>
