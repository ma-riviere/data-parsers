          <p>The Elyos practically worship their precious sun, almost as much as they do their decadent Seraphim Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmodians need no such crutches. Our legs are strong enough to stand on their own, without a sun's blinding light and heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos think their sun makes them blessed. What they don't realize is that it's ultimately their greatest weakness.</p>

          <p>But their arrogance also keeps them from realizing just how weak they are. So they continue to strut and preen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Veille, minion of Kaisinel, is one of the worst. She is a true believer in the Elyos mindset, which makes her at once deluded and dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even now, as Asmodae marches on her stronghold, she believes she is unstoppable, that she alone will turn back the tide.</p>
