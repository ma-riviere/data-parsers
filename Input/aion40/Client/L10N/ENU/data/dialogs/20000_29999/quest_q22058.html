        <body>
          <p>Good [%userrace], I had a pet Maeki named Lasi. She was tamed and trained by my father and was my boon companion for my entire childhood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I made the mistake of bringing her with me here. Tiamat's influence, and the presence of wild Maeki, must have overcome her training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She escaped last night, not even recognizing me. She might still be wandering out there as an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Displacerbeast_Rage_58_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, kill Enraged Maekis until you find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_22058a]. Thus will I know my beloved Lasi is at peace.</p>

          <p>I was just thinking of the times Lasi and I shared.... I will remember those, not her final days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you find Lasi's Leash? I wish to have it as a keepsake of those happy memories.</p>

          <p>Yes, that's it. Oh, Lasi, I'm sorry.  I should never have brought you to this cursed place. Your mistress failed you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what's done is done. I can only pray Lady Siel watches over her as she returns to the Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for doing what I could never have been able to do. You've comforted my soul this day.</p>
