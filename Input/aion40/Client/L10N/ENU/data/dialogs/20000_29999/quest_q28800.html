          <p>Your recent battles tell upon your weary face. Have you ever been to Pernon? There, you can refresh yourself and relax in a home of your very own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Consider this: as a reward for your valuable service and selfless dedication, you may now sharpen your claws in the comfort of your own studio, and place upon your walls the trophies of your great achievements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Doman] to teleport you to Pernon--and if you go, please give my regards to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Harretion].</p>
