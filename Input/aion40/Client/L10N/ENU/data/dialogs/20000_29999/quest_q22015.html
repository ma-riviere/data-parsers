          <p>Daeva, come here. I... have a favor to ask, but it's embarrassing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I may have exaggerated my combat prowess back in Kamar. Said some things that weren't, perhaps, entirely true.</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a scholar, you see, and we're often chided for our lack of physical brawn. You can imagine how that chafes one's pride. But now... I've been given a mission that I cannot even imagine attempting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>South of the Steam Springs, the Dragonbound have set up camp in an abandoned village. The orders are to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticKn_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticEl_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticSc_58_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticPr_58_An]s. If you were to aid me, I would reward you, I swear it.</p>

          <p>[%username], finally! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been trying to keep a low profile so my commanders think I've gone off to fight the Dragonbound, but it's not easy hiding in a tent for days on end.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not cut out for deception. If only my transformational magic research was complete.... How did it go?</p>
