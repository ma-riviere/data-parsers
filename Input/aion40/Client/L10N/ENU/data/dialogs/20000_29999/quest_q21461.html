          <p>What? What do you want, Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Daevas come here. But I only have standard supplies. Nothing unnatural--Shulack's honor!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Business is good. But if other Shulacks find me here...I will be in big trouble.</p>

          <p>Fine, I had the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Book_Q11461]! Just don't tell other Shulacks I'm here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have it now though....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know where the book is--Shulack's honor! But if finding it is important, I might be able to help, if Daeva wants.</p>

          <p>Fine, I might know where the book is. A Daeva named Carabel hid it in a hole in Taloc's Boughs--the same hole I nap in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I threw the book out, and I don't know where it landed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look for the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Book_Q11461] on Taloc's Boughs! I'm sure it's there somewhere. Give it back to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Carabel], tear it up, sell it, I don't care. Just take it away so no more Daevas come looking for it!</p>

          <p>What a jerk! That book is my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_doc_quest_21461a]! It was stolen from me while I was in Taloc's Hollow!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went back to look for it several times, and that Shulack pretended he didn't know about it!</p>

          <p>Finally! This is the research report that I wrote when I went to investigate Taloc's Hollow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was walking along Taloc's Boughs when I tripped and my belongings scattered all over. When I finally gathered them up, I realized a bunch of stuff was missing! I know that Shulack was responsible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait a second...shards! This isn't even my rep...oh...this is interesting though. Hmmmm, someone put a lot of effort into this. Oh well, I'll keep it anyway. Thanks, [%username].</p>
