          <p>It started slowly... just a vague feeling of darkness and damp from the Crucible Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first, I assumed it was just shadows of the disturbed auras of Daevas returning from Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, from the images I'm getting now, I can tell it wasn't that at all.</p>

          <p>I saw a... rift... forming in the Crucible. It resonates with the numbing power of Vanktrist Spacetwine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His power... it has weakened the Aetheric field around Illusion Stadium. I think the field is sporadically faltering and creating a rift that's letting Tiamat's Balaur into the Crucible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rift is closed now, and I've reinforced the field, but the likelihood of another rift ripping through is pretty high. I'm going to need help dealing with this.</p>

          <p>I hate to admit it... I have all of this power to create illusions and protective fields, but in actual combat, I'm pathetic. I simply don't have the aptitude or training for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go into the Crucible Challenge and give Vanktrist a lashing? Once he's down for the count, wait for another [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In] to open. If my suspicions are right, you'll find plenty of Balaur on the other side of the rift. Destroy the cursed beasts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vanktrist is really strong. I'm pretty sure you're going to have to fight him several times before the rift appears. But, when you are, report to Combat Sergeant [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anja]. She's very efficient and can handle things from there.</p>

          <p>A rift? In the Crucible? How is that even possible?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur must be getting desperate, daring to attack the Marchutan Priory so directly.</p>

          <p>Not the news I was expecting, but now that we know I can inform my superiors and initiate the appropriate counter measures.</p>

          <p>Daeva of Time Inggness suspected that Tiamat's Balaur had been making incursions into the Crucible by taking advantage of a weakness in the Aetheric field caused by Vanktrist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She reinforced the field, but she was worried that another rift might open. She asked you to look for one, then go through it and destroy any Balaur you found.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It did and you did. Then you reported what happened to Combat Sergeant Anja who sent the intel up the chain of command.</p>
