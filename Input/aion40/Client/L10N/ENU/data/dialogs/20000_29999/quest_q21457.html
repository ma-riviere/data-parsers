          <p>This place is both fascinating and disturbing. I learn so much, yet so much of what I learn is troubling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take Taloc, for example. The flow of Aether emanating from him has altered considerably since the Cataclysm, but no one knows why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I yearn to go to him myself and take in his secrets. But I find obstacles in my path....</p>

          <p>I would gladly accept the risk, but I am not allowed to. Thus I must send proxies--and you would be ideal, [%username]. You are known to be strong, and you are allowed inside Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I seek something very specific: wood from deep inside Taloc. Just as normal trees' rings tell of their life and growth, so do Taloc's.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Fascinating. I can already see myriad events and interpretations. I will have much fun with this sample.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The progress of knowledge is the progress of Asmodae. You have done more for your people than you ever could have on the battlefield, as far as I'm concerned.</p>
