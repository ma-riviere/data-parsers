          <p>Have you ever heard of Raksang? It's a prison where Tiamat locked up Raksha, a mighty dragon who tried to challenge him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But with us here, Tiamat is getting desperate. There are rumors that he's planning to release Raksha, in exchange for his allegiance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However much Raksha hates Tiamat, he undoubtedly hates Daevas more. If he is freed, he'll make our lives infinitely harder.</p>

          <p>There's a further complication: a Reian named Hiel, taken by the Balaur long ago. He was rescued from the Raksang area with no memory of what happened to him while he was there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this latest rumor must've stirred something, because he ran off, with a promise to "take care of everything."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And with the huge surge in Aether and Drana energy we've detected from Raksang.... Things are coming to a head. We need Daevas to investigate.</p>

          <p>We believe the Balaur took Hiel because he's an expert in sealing magics. Undoubtedly, he was kidnapped in order to ply his trade inside the prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hiel must be somewhere in Raksang right now. He must hold valuable information. Rescue him once more, if you can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk to Arza; she is an expert on Raksang, and an old friend of Hiel. She'll tell you what you must do.</p>
