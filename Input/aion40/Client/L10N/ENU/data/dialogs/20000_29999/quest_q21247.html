          <p>Praise Azphel! An Asmodian! Oh, Aion, I'd almost despaired of ever seeing a friendly face again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard you battling the Balaur. You've done quite a number on this place. Good work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that this is the time or place to slap each other on the backs. We need to get out of here.</p>

          <p>Wait! Don't waste your energy trying to batter down my prison. It won't work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This crystal is one of their little innovations. Balaur can walk right through it. But to any other species, it's harder than titanium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been thinking. Perhaps if I could wear Balaur armor, I could escape. Walk right on through like they do. I assume...hope...that you'll help me escape this blasted place?</p>

          <p>That's a relief. Hope has been in short supply ever since I was imprisoned here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest getting the armor from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C5_DrakanPr_Re_lab_55_An]s. You can slip the pieces to me, and I can fit them together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate to rush you, but every moment that passes is another that the inevitable Balaur reinforcements draw near.</p>

          <p>That's cold-blooded of you. But admittedly correct. No sense in both of us getting captured. Then neither of us would have a prayer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But remember this: once the Balaur return, I'm dead. I'm next on their little experimentation list.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if you leave, hurry, so you can tell Javis that I'm here. It's the only way to save my life.</p>

          <p>Hmm, very nice. You managed to get these without battering them down too much. You're a true Asmodian, with an iron will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I admire your restraint. I certainly don't think I'll have that kind of control against the Balaur when I get out of here.</p>

          <p>Here. This is some stuff I had hidden on me that my jailers didn't find. You can have it.</p>
