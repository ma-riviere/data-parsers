          <p>Well now, [%username], I hope you can tell from the big smile on my face what my decision was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You followed the design perfectly, yet put your own mark on the result. It is distinctly yours, and it is distinctly well-made.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's already on its way to the High Priest. Congratulations.</p>

          <p>You've proven both your own worth and the worth of my methods. For a new teacher like myself, both are high praise indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now all that remains is the official ceremony, led by High Priest Agehia herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready for the wonderful world of Master Handicrafting?</p>

          <p>Official ceremonies are a little too formal for me, but they do serve a purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They really do grab attention, so everyone can see what you've accomplished. It's a heady feeling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, take this recommendation letter to High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agehia] at the Convent of Marchutan. She'll take things from there.</p>

          <p>Oh, I dislike formal ceremonies too, but that doesn't mean I have to--or can--avoid them at every turn!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This really is a special honor, you know. Asmodians don't shy away from taking due credit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a pretty painless procedure all around. Let me know when you feel like attending.</p>
