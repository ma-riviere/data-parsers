          <p>Ah, [%username]! I have a little problem. I've been having an argument with a colleague of mine. He says the term "meatshield" is not derogatory to Templars.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I disagree. Templars might be protectors first and foremost, but there is much they can accomplish on the battlefield not related to being smacked around. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Calling a Templar a "meatshield," even if he or she is protecting you, earns you a one way trip to the Obelisk in my experience. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Hits too close to home? Very well--I'll respect your privacy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I have something that might interest a Templar of your skill. The Temple of Destruction recently issued an official statement promoting the use of Greater Stigma. You've used Greater Stigma before, haven't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What am I saying? Of course you have! You're the renowned [%username]! Now then...the Temple of Destruction also provided me with brand new Greater Stigma to issue to the finest Templars. Are you interested in earning one?</p>

          <p>I knew you couldn't resist, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now then, the Temple of Destruction isn't looking for a fancy tribute. They just want to know that their Greater Stigma are being put to good use on the battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They only want to reward worthy Templars who won't let the Greater Stigma go to waste. So...in order to prove yourself, why don't you just use ***...10 times. Do that, and I'll reward you with a new Greater Stigma.</p>

          <p>Don't just turn this down--the Temple of Destruction isn't issuing these new Greater Stigma to any Templar who asks.</p>

          <p>I have no way of knowing for sure, but I'll take the word of a Templar.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I knew this task wasn't too much for a Templar of your skill. In fact, I think it was a little too easy, to be honest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, take this Greater Stigma as your reward. The Temple of Destruction will be pleased that it is being put to good use. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now...personally...I'd recommend heading over to Gelkmaros and using it to wage war on the Balaur and the Elyos. The Daevas there could use your help.</p>
