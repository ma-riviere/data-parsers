          <p>Hmm? Why are you still here? I thought you'd be too excited about your new home to stop and chat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't know how to get there? Have you been out in the sun too long? Enter through the gates to my left, or use the Homeward Bound skill from anywhere in the world. Even you won't get too lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go on, try it out. And when you're done, speak to Chuchurinerk. He's enthusiastic about meeting new neighbors.</p>

          <p>Yes yes, I know all the Daevas here. Also know that you need furniture to make your home cozy, yes? You can buy good furniture from Chuchurinerk. All the small things to make your home more homey.</p>

          <p>For decoration, no one knows better than the Manager of Tezz's House. You should meet Katenon.</p>

          <p>Welcome to the neighborhood!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you really want to make this home your own, you have some serious decisions to make. A home should represent the personality of its owner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How do you want to decorate your space?</p>

          <p>Not quite sure of the details yet? Perhaps a quick tour of this home might give you some decorating ideas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tezz might own the place, but he left all the decisions about the house to me. So most of the furniture and decorations are my choices and reflect more about my personality than his. Perhaps if Tezz stopped by more often....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this house warming gift. Yes, I should give it to you when I visit your place, but I'm afraid I might not have the time.</p>

          <p>You went to your studio, but found it quite empty. You understood then why Sarrik advised you to meet with Construction Merchant Chuchurinerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you visited Chuchurinerk, the furniture merchant also suggested that you visit Katenon, a house management expert. You met Katenon and received a housewarming gift.</p>
