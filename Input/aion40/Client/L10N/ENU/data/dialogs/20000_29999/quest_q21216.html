          <p>Tanar has been his usual self of late. A Scolopen wandered into the camp, and he attacked it with a cooking knife and a cutting block. If I hadn't been here, he'd probably look like a poisoned marshmallow right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we're on the verge of a breakthrough with our research on the Balaur. We're edging closer to discovering the secret behind Tiamat's power!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Exciting, isn't it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You've most likely seen or heard of Earthfang Gorge or the Floating Island--those are two examples of Tiamat's incredible power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat wields mastery over all that is stone, earth, and rock. He can create a chasm a thousand meters wide, or lift an entire mountain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Traces of Tiamat's power are most apparent at the Dragonrest, where he fought a great battle in the past. If we can discover the secret behind his abilities, it will aid us when we inevitably face him.</p>

          <p>I'm glad you asked, [%username]. When Tanar and I first arrived in Gelkmaros, we placed magic stones all over the Dragonrest with the help of the Archons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In theory, the stones will have absorbed a great deal of Tiamat's power by now, and I'm itching to test my hypothesis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you break the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FloatingStone_Q21216]s at the Dragonrest, I will be able to collect data based on the amount of power released. Are you up to the task, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Great! Just make a thorough sweep of the Dragonrest and you're bound to find the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FloatingStone_Q21216]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Break them, and I'll collect the data from here. Five should do the trick.</p>
