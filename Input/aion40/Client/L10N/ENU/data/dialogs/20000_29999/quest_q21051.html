          <p>I hear Empyrean Lord Marchutan himself chose this site. It definitely reflects great wisdom and cunning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Protected by hostile terrain, small and easily defended entry points.... We're lucky we got here first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As long as we keep our supplies up, we can hold out against any attack almost indefinitely.</p>

          <p>Indeed. But we still have our share of problems too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In particular, rock creatures are all over the place. They're hard to spot from a distance and pack a hard punch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Phina says they're animated by magic created before the Cataclysm. Wherever they came from, they make life here more difficult.</p>

          <p>Good guess. We had a Daeva who took care of them for us, but she was called back to Pandaemonium last month.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to hire you to destroy rock creatures and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21051a]s. We think that's what brings them to life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't pay much, but I can give you a piece of armor--some pauldrons you can't get from a store. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Great! Eradicate the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q21051all]! Remember to bring the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21051a] they leave behind. More will be created if you just leave them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and my superiors won't let me give away the pauldrons unless they know the threat has been reduced. I'm afraid one round of hunting won't do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll also need 50,000 Kinah to start crafting it to your measurements. Believe me, it'll be worth it once it's done.</p>

          <p>Yes, I'm sure you have more important things to do. The great Daevas always do--the rest tend to be so incompetent that we have to hold their hand all the time.</p>

          <p>Yes, I can feel the magic in them. It's certainly ancient--at least, it doesn't feel like magic any Daeva uses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll hand these to our Sorcerers. They'll find a way to destroy them--maybe even a way to rob them of their power without a fight.</p>

          <p>Give me a moment while I speak to my soldiers. If they think the rock monsters have been sufficiently cleared out, the pauldron is yours right now.</p>
