          <p>It seems the Balaur have been researching some new Stigma down in the Naduka Biolab. Their subjects were some Krall saps, but something went wrong--they're all dead. It looks like the Drakan researchers have been turned into the undead too, while the handful of survivors fled to Dragonrest to devise some kind of plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We want the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21277a] those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_21277]s most likely have on them. The survivors wouldn't have had a chance to take them, so they're ours for the plucking. Get them, and bring them back with some Document Reagent you can get from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Thuth].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get going, [%username]. If we drag our heels on this we might lose out altogether.</p>
