          <p>You may not know this, but Haramel's caused a big uproar in Pandaemonium. The fact it all happened in secret...that Kobolds from Elysea got here....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There were...and still are...all sorts of wild theories and accusations. The Elyos are involved, the Lepharists, the Black Cloud Traders....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All prisoners are being interrogated. Still not much luck communicating with the Elyos, but the rest all deny involvement.</p>

          <p>Perhaps. But I have new orders from Pandaemonium concerning Hamerun's "overseers." No, not the Shugo, Sapien overseers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems that Hamerun was careful to brainwash certain Sapien figures with leadership qualities to keep his operations going smoothly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With them, Haramel can keep running no matter what happens to Hamerun. Without them, it'll fall apart. Can you assist with this mission?</p>

          <p>Of course. You have been to Haramel; you have seen what Hamerun and his minions are capable of. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The overseers are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_02_DBrownieWWa_named_18_an], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_05_RatmanMWa_named_19_an], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_07_DBrownieWWa_named_20_an].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They should be carrying particular items. Bring them back as proof of their deaths for Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>I constantly tell Gulkalla that he is not alone, that he does not have to take so much upon himself, but he never listens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has a heightened sense of personal responsibility. Good to have, to a point.... But he'll collapse in exhaustion at this rate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if Daevas like you are able to contribute, we'll at least be able to take Haramel off his list of concerns.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I believe you. But Pandaemonium might not, and continue to pressure Gulkalla.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I also asked you to gather proof from the corpses of Drudgelord Kakiti, MuMu Ham the Grey, and Bossman Nukiti.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you return to Haramel, and gather that proof. Only then will the case of Haramel be closed.</p>

          <p>Yes...yes, this should be sufficient proof for Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think Gulkalla will rest a little easier now. On his behalf, and on the behalf of all of us who follow him, thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, take whatever you like. We owe you so much more than this, but this will have to do...for now.</p>
