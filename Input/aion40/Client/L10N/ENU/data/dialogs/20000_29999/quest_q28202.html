          <p>I hope you're not feeling too pleased with yourself. Completing Stage 3 isn't exactly the highest of accomplishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's certainly not going to help us recover after our fated defeat at Vorgaltem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we're going to get past that blow, we'll have to hit Tiamat back even harder.</p>

          <p>And mine as well. But you haven't yet proved to me that you're capable of doing so.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll take the next step in proving yourself now--I want you to complete Stage 5.</p>

          <p>Who you'll have to fight, I'm not sure. Even with that uncertainty, are you still going in?</p>

          <p>I expected no less. Just so you know, you should be prepared to deal with either Steel Rake Shulack or Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, you'll have to start from Stage 1 all over again, so be prepared for that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've defeated all the foes in Stage 5, come back and see me.</p>

          <p>I'd have thought you'd have learned that by now. Come back when you grow a backbone, faux Elyos.</p>
