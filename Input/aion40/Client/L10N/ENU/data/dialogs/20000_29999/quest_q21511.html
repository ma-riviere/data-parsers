          <p>Uck, hold on, I think I'm going to be sick. No, no, I'm fine. Ahem. Okay, this serious now, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We just have to... smear you with this fruit juice, and... hup, hold on, I'm gonna--no, I'm okay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahem. The Calydon have incredibly strong senses of smell. Those huge noses, you know? If we can't stand this--huck, hold on... okay, I'm okay--if we can't stand this smell, then they'll stay far away from you. This stink should keep them at a distance while you grab the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4a_21511_piece] from the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A4_06].</p>

          <p>Woah, easy, easy! So the smell had no effect on the Humnaz, the Petralith Fragment disintegrated when you touched it, and then some Ritual Coordinator showed up to investigate?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, I understand that you're mad, [%username], but you don't need to yell. The smell will go away... eventually. Couple of days at most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the bright side, I guess we don't have to worry about the Humnaz using Petralith technology. Seems like that chunk of Petralith was so ancient it wasn't really worth all our effort. Oh well! Hey--why are your eyes glowing red?</p>

          <p>Reeking of filthy trousers smeared with mouldering fruit and then well-ironed, you hurried to the Warrior's Shrine to steal the Petralith Fragment there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You fought your way to the fragment, but as soon as you touched it, it disintegrated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then another Humnaz showed up to check on the Petralith Fragment, and you had to kill him, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You reported back to Tanitia, who did not seem to understand why you were unhappy with her.</p>
