          <p>Excuse me. Are you [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've never met. My name is Sieger. I'm with Siel's Spear Legion, the legion directly managed by Lady Siel before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of its soldiers are gone now--only a few are left in Atreia, divided between Elysea and Asmodae. But I'm rambling.... I came here to ask you a favor.</p>

          <p>I served Divine Hisen once, before the Cataclysm, and recently I've heard people mentioning his name. It seems he appears in their nightmares...perhaps you too have seen him?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Divine Hisen that I know was a private person. He hated gossip and rumors, and he would be devastated to learn he was part of a nightmare, his name being thrown about like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have gone to all who dreamed of him and asked them to kill him if they saw him inside their nightmares, so he could rest in peace. But over and over, my request was declined. Will you also refuse me?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Please, can you do this quickly?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowing Divine Hisen, he'll be in the Temple Vault even in a nightmare. He was always concerned with guarding the sealed relics--it was his true calling in life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, enter your nightmare and seek out the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede_Seal_Room]. Once there, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCromede_01_Named_Hierarch_38_An]...as painlessly and decently as possible. Kromede's Trial is a trial for more than one person....</p>

          <p>Thank you for helping me. It's nice to know that you're different from the others. You actually care about things like this.</p>

          <p>Please, take this as a token of appreciation. It's the least I can do for being such an irascible old man about all this.</p>
