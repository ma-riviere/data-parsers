          <p>You have heard of what some call Dark Poeta, I assume? Even though it hap...might happen in Elysea, there is no way to be sure the same fate will not befall Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium nearly fell into chaos over the matter, but fortunately Empyrean Lord Marchutan has his head about him. He carefully researched the matter, and learned that Dragon Lord Tiamat was reliant on Siel's Relics.</p>

          <p>Ancient relics empowered by the fallen Lady Siel, Protector of the Tower of Eternity and the Lady of Time. If Tiamat cannot obtain Siel's Relics, Dark Poeta will never come about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Marchutan predicted that the relics would be found in Gelkmaros, so the army was led there. Unfortunately, they have not yet found anything. More help is needed--your help. I am not yet convinced, but....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose if Lord Vidar sent you here, then Lord Marchutan will be expecting you. He will surely have predicted that you would come to his aid.</p>

          <p>He said he'd come get everything himself as soon as he settled down, but I guess he must be quite busy, so he's paying extra to have his things shipped with Tigrina.</p>

          <p>Not for Gelkmaros--for the ship, nyerk. Have you ever heard of an instant shock absorber? A special device used on Trader ships. It absorbs shocks. Instantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tigrina wants one of those. Plus a box of extra strength anti-nausea pills. Akakakakak! All hard to make! Not supposed to be traded with non-Black Cloud without permission, but must offer help to get in return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could do business with others, I suppose. Easier to deal with Elyos, maybe. Or Balaur...ean residents. Nyerk. Would never help the Balaur, of course. Nyerk nyerk. I have to go.</p>
