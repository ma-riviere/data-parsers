          <p>What? Oh, sorry, I was talking to myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For some reason, creatures keep gathering around the Aether Generator.</p>

          <p>Every time I go out to check it, they're there, no matter how many times I drive them away.</p>

          <p>I wish I knew. The only theory I have is that the flashes that the Generator emits attract them somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that the reason matters. It's only a matter of time before one of those things damages it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I also have to protect Farbin here--Aion knows he can't defend himself. Do you think you could lend a hand?</p>

          <p>My thanks. I have my hands full with the scholar. He'd walk right into a Balaur patrol if I weren't there to steer him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Hellhound_Wolf_53_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_BAT_DR_53_n]s causing the most trouble. Kill them and hopefully things will return to normal.</p>

          <p>Farbin's ramblings are almost like white noise to me now. Sometimes I can't sleep if I don't hear him babbling away.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. Maybe their fellow beasts will take the hint and stay away.</p>
