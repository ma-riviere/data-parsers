          <p>Shards! I'm starving here, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't had a tasty meal in weeks, and not even Fundin the Fearless can fight on an empty stomach. Well, actually...I can go days, even weeks without food...but I worry about the others. That's it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just think of fair Shaenna, and how she must suffer on an empty stomach. I want to go out and slay a hundred, nay, a thousand of these Balaurean beasts, and take their succulent meat back to her.</p>

          <p>Hah! Such menial tasks are below Fundin the Fearless. This is why Daevas like you exist--to support the true heroes of Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The supplies from Gelkmaros Fortress haven't been coming as fast as I would like, so we need a backup plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ksellids in the area make for a delicious stew, and I'm sure we can feed ourselves for a couple weeks if we keep some of their meat in reserve. Will you bring honor to your name by serving Fundin the Fearless?</p>

          <p>Head out to the field and obtain [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21233] from the Ksellids. The beasts are fierce, but I have a feeling you are a match for their savagery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And make sure you only pick up the juiciest pieces. Fundin the Fearless does not contaminate his body with inferior meat.</p>
