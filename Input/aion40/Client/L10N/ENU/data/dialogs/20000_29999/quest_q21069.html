          <p>Ah, [%username]. Allow me to explain my earlier deductions about you. The small scar on your wrist is a brand only given to Ulgorn's Raiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those who spend a significant amount of time in Gelkmaros have boots caked with Plia pollen. Yours, however, only have a light dusting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I recognized the crest on that signet you carry as being that of General Suthran. Hence your travels to Altgard.</p>

          <p>Elementary. Now, my dear [%username], Shawster last saw his wife near the [%dic:STR_DIC_SEN_DF4_SensoryArea_Q21069] at Antagor Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The stones in the area should still bear minute traces of blood, or whatever the stains Shawster saw were.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also need a sample of the grass in the area to examine. Will you be my eyes and ears?</p>

          <p>Capital! Now, for this sample, I need you to cut out a large piece of sod and lift it directly from the ground. I'll tell you why later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And do memorize what the grass looked like before you disturb it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These are dark waters, [%username]. I fear for what we may find, but the truth must be discovered.</p>

          <p>Welcome back, [%username]. While you were gone, I have been conducting inquiries of my own.</p>

          <p>This missing assistant, Maron, is quite the interesting figure. I've heard much about him that's been enlightening.</p>

          <p>I would go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_SEN_DF4_SensoryArea_Q21069] myself, but other avenues of investigation pull me away.</p>
