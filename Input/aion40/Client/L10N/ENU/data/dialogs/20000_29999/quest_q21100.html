          <p>What? No, my name is Purkin, and that is Domati. Mitta is my cart. She's right over there. Good old Mitta. She has been by my side for years. She has helped me, housed me, and never abandoned me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, she is even feeding me now that I am a refugee.</p>

          <p>You do not believe me? Mitta carries much more food than I could in my pockets, or a Cube.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she is in a bad way now. Those evil Balaur attacked us, and now I need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21100a]s to fix her!</p>
