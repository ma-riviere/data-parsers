          <p>I hope you like that book I gave you. I never knew that grooming could be so involved. And the chapter on characteristic pet expressions, very interesting.</p>

          <p>It took me a while to master them, but now it's just second nature.</p>

          <p>You will, you will. Just keep reading and talking to other pet owners, and pet specialists...like me. We all enjoy sharing our experiences.</p>

          <p>Lovely. It's always great to welcome more pet lovers into our group. Speaking of group, you really should go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Erdil].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She knows more about pets than anyone else I can think of. We once hung out at the Apellbine talked pets till half-past three! Hah! Those were the days.</p>

          <p>I'm glad Katin sent you over. It's such a delight to talk to other pet lovers. It takes a sensitive person to recognize that pets are just as emotional as people...and they are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why, I think they're naturally more sensitive to our emotions than we are to theirs. What they do effortlessly, we have to work at.</p>
          <p> </p>     
          <p>Try showing affection when your pet does something cute or when they look sad. They'll be thrilled! I bet you'll be surprised how well your pet reacts.</p>

          <p>Once you start interacting with a pet, never hesitate. They read hesitation as indifference, and it hurts their feelings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and playing with your pet is a great way to bond. Take them to the park, play ball, go swimming, teach them tricks. Anything done together will make both of you happier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, this is for you...I like encouraging fellow pet lovers. I think you'll find it helpful.</p>

          <p>When you met Erdil, she told you that pets are sensitive to their owner's feelings, and you need to be sensitive to theirs.</p>
