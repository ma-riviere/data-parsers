          <p>Shards! Some of these so-called Spiritmasters couldn't summon a fanged Porgus!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're just in time, [%username]. I was about to give up hope that I could find a worthy Spiritmaster for these Greater Stigma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can use Greater Stigma, can't you?</p>

          <p>Ha, I should have known. I just asked that question to see if I had your attention, and don't you dare respond with "Huh? What?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple of Wisdom has issued me these Greater Stigma to be distributed to our Spiritmasters. The thing is, the temple wants to see them utilized for the war effort, not just jumbling around in some Daeva's warehouse. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to find the best recipients for the new Greater Stigma, I have prepared a challenging task that tests a Spirtmaster's true abilities. Think you're up to it?</p>

          <p>Glad to know you haven't lost your courage, [%username]. I want you to summon a Fire Spirit that can melt a glacier with a single blast.... Hahaha! I had you going there for a second!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, this task isn't all that difficult. I just make it seem like it is to scare off the weaker Spiritmasters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now then...I want you to master a Greater Stigma skill. I think *** should do nicely. Cast it 10 times, then return to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't frown at me like that! I just saved you a lot of time! I could have easily sent you out on some asinine mission to the middle of nowhere.</p>
