          <p>Halt! Who goes there?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, Daeva! I apologize. Between the Dredgion bombings and the Balaur ranging around our farmlands, everyone in the village is quite tense. We have seen enough suffering and violence to fuel a lifetime of bad dreams.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's not just the Balaur. Creatures in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2] are becoming more aggressive as well. Just this morning a Dionae severed a soldier's hand. A Dionae!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could help us hunt some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Dionae_DR_56_An] down, it would ease my soldiers' minds.</p>

          <p>You must be very capable, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or perhaps my soldiers are so wracked by recent experience that they have lost their edge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for easing our load, Daeva. I do appreciate it.</p>

          <p>Manyos' soldiers had been having trouble with the Fanned Dionae in Trepone Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He wasn't sure if the Dionae were getting more aggressive or if his men were having a difficult time recovering from recent Dredgion bombings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You didn't have much trouble dispatching the Dionae, but Manyos was grateful all the same.</p>
