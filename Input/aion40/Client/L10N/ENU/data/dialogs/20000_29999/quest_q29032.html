          <p>You continue to amaze me, [%username]. I thought there was nothing left to teach you, but it appears to be one of those rare times I was mistaken.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I've been deep in my own studies, just to make sure I stay on top of my own game. Can't fall behind, you know.</p>

          <p>A trifle for one of your evident skills. You need to create an offering for the Convent of Marchutan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, High Priest Agehia just expressed a desire for a Spellbook. That should be the perfect offering, and the perfect test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hardly think I need to ask you the question, but are you ready for the next level?</p>

          <p>At this point in your apprenticeship, this is a mere formality, but it should be a challenge, even for you.</p>

          <p>Oh, the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_29032] design for the Master test, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've got two choices of design: Agehia's Spellbook or Agehia's Noble Spellbook. Both can only be used once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One is cheaper, but the other is more certain, since it will always produce a Noble result when the crafting succeeds. Do you need more information?</p>

          <p>Honir says Agehia's Spellbook design is rudimentary. It's up to the alchemist to etch the runes just right and infuse Aether into each page.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not everyone succeeds in making an Agehia's Noble Spellbook out of the design, but it does cost just 251,000 Kinah. That includes a prototype.</p>

          <p>Right, that one's pretty good. It includes detailed instructions on symbology interaction and page-cutting. It also comes with a prototype.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're sure to create an Agehia's Noble Spellbook. But it does cost a bit more--334,500 Kinah, to be exact.</p>
