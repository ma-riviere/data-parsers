          <p>Hmmmm.... I haven't heard any news from the Refugee Village since yesterday. The Archons working there are supposed to send situation reports twice a day, morning and afternoon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had heard some strange Sapiens were spotted near the village recently. Now I'm worried that something happened to the Archons.</p>

          <p>My theory is that they're particularly vulnerable to disease because they're undernourished, so I've been procuring meat in the area and feeding them myself. All by myself.</p>
