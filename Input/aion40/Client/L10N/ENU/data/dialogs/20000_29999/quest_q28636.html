          <p>Why in Asmodae wouldn't you wear a perfectly good necklace? I'll tell you.</p>

          <p>It's a powerful weapon, but it can be made even more powerful with Kromede's Flame and the help of a proper blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've got Kromede's Flame and a talented blacksmith (at your service!) so all you need now is the longbow.</p>

          <p>A wise decision. The Longbow of the Judge is a fine weapon, but I imagine you might break it in half if you weren't careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the Longbow of the Judge is kept by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>	
          <p>At least, that's what the local legends say.</p>

          <p>All right, first thing I do is put the Longbow in the white-hot forge, to get the wood nice and pliable. Then....</p>
