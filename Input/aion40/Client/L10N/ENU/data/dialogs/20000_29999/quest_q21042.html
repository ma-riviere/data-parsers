          <p>Have you been to the Nunglark Ruins yet, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's occupied by Krall and Mau, you know. By order of the Drakan, the poor dispossessed Sapiens who used to live there were killed or scattered to the winds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a plan to drive out the insidious Krall and Mau at the village. Not only will this rid the world of our enemies, but it will allow us to gather some much-needed Aether.</p>

          <p>Unlike other creatures in Balaurea, these Krall and Mau don't seem to be much affected by Drana. We can extract a small amount of Aether from their bodies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can bring 6 units each of the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21042a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21042b], I'll be able to get the Aether I need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the way, you'll also need to buy a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_d_redeem_jewelry_02a] so I can refine the Aether in the blood. Otherwise the Aether will dissipate, uselessly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is all that worth a Mithril coin to you?</p>

          <p>I'm pretty sure you can distinguish a Krall from a Mau, [%username], but I had a young confused Daeva here not so long ago, so I'll be specific.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Krall Blood comes from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_KrallFi_DR_53_An] and Mau Blood comes from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LycanFi_DR_53_An]. You can find them at the Nunglark Ruins.</p>
