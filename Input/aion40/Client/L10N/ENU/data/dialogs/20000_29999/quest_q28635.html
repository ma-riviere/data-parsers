          <p>Wait, [%username]. Were you planning to wear Kromede's Flame as a necklace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only an Elmo would do something like that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I were you, I'd use it coat the Staff of the Judge to increase its performance.</p>

          <p>To reinforce the Staff of the Judge, you need Kromede's Flame, the staff--obviously--and a capable blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first and the last you already have. The Staff of the Judge is something you'll have to go get, however.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You bring me that staff, and I'll refine it like it's never been refined before.</p>

          <p>You won't regret this decision. We'll make history here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But first we need the Staff of the Judge. From what I've heard, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] has it in the Fire Temple.</p>

          <p>Haha. I can appreciate caution, but really, I'm sure I can do this.</p>

          <p>See that veteran Daeva of Flame? I made all his weapons. On the same day. At the same time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I was asleep! Come to me with the Staff of the Judge and Kromede's Flame in your Cube, and I'll fix your weapon up while juggling Klaw eggs.</p>

          <p>I guess I should have told you that I've never actually worked with a staff before.</p>

          <p>Anyway, here you go, Kromede's Staff. See how that feels. Looks good to me!</p>
