          <p>Ah, so Lord Marchutan thinks you're ready to deal with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dramata_57_Al], eh? I won't question his judgment. I only hope you don't disappoint him, for your own sake as well as his.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find Padmarashka deep in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C6]. Your legion had better be on their toes.</p>

          <p>All Asmodae should celebrate what you've done today. You've dealt a grevious blow to the Dragon Lords, and demonstrated your might for all Atreia to see.</p>

          <p>An order appeared on the Noble Scroll, telling you to hunt down the Dramata called Padmarashka.</p>

          <p>After reporting to Batalrion, you went to Padmarashka's cave in the Earthfang Gorge and slew her.</p>

          <p>Batalrion was very impressed by your feat, but noted that Lord Marchutan had more orders for you.</p>
