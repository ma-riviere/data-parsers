          <p>You seem willing to help those who advance the cause of knowledge. An admirable trait.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are able, I have some colleagues that could use the aid of a [%userclass] such as yourself. The Strigik Research Group in the Strigik Forest is having...difficulties.</p>

          <p>I'm not sure. Feles was unable to tell me much in her letter--only that she needed the aid of someone both strong and sensitive to the needs of research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You certainly seem to fit her description, and she indicated that she was willing and able to compensate you for your time and trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think, [%username]? Their work is quite important--I'd hate to see it interrupted.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to hear that.</p>

          <p>Cross the creek out front and follow the road straight on. Take a right at the fork you come across. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A4] is at the center of the forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_feles] when you arrive, and tell her I sent you. She'll be happy to see you, I'm sure.</p>

          <p>I expected as much. No Daeva comes to Gelkmaros with nothing to do.</p>

          <p>I do not blame you--I'm just a little disappointed, that's all.</p>

          <p>Oh, thank Aion! The more protection I have, the better I feel. I'm afraid I'm more used to libraries than forests filled with huge owl beasts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I have to buck up. I'm an Asmodian, and a scholar. I need to tackle my work and my fears head-on. Still, this place.... Brrrr!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Irkale is right--I do have need of you, as do my guards. Hope you work hard for us!</p>
