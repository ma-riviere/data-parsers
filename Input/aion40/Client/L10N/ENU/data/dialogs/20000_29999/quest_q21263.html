          <p>For all its power, the Piece of Zikel just takes up space in your cube the way it is right now. It sounds harsh, but it's the truth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unlocking its full potential isn't something for us. We're not trained in the advanced ways of smithing required.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do, however, know someone who is. I'm sure she'll be able to help you.</p>

          <p>Her name is Usener. You might have met her in Pandaemonium. She's a very well-known and talented smith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With her talent, the Piece of Zikel will be the pick that plucks the Polearm's strings, creating the ultimate melody.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one small potential catch, though.</p>

          <p>From what I understand, this requires a precise process. It may become very expensive for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener] has a fair and honest reputation.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Very smart. You didn't strike me as the kind of Daeva who'd reject an opportunity like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Piece of Zikel is well-known in smithing circles. Ah, I would love to see her face when she finds out you have it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please go to Pandaemonium at once. The sooner your power grows, the sooner you can put it to use for Asmodae.</p>

          <p>That's unfortunate. I'd have at least gone to hear what Usener had to say. But then, I'm not you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what sort of reputation she has among the average Daeva, but I know her. She is very skilled and quite reasonable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if that's what's holding you back, don't let it. Especially when you have the chance to improve your strength.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to be honest with you: almost all smiths would happily toss their mothers into Reshanta to get a chance to work with a Piece of Zikel.</p>

          <p>The closest most get is a bunch of whispered rumors or drunken boasts at Apellbine. I never thought that I'd...!</p>

          <p>The process requires specialized materials. Very expensive specialized materials.</p>
