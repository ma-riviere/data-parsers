          <p> </p>
          <p>While you were away, we began pursuing Kumbanda, whom we learned was hiding in Subterranea. I dispatched one of my best to chase him--a Daeva named Daonce--but we were a bit too late, and Kumbanda slipped away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the aid of some Reian tribesmen, Daonce managed to discover that Kumbanda was doing something with Siel's Relics there. The two were just about to learn the truth, but....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to find him, or at least to learn what happened to him. This Reian tribesman, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Belik], will be a good place to start. You can find him in the Gelkmaros Defense Base.</p>

          <p>Anilmo--one of the other tribesmen--uncovered a critical clue involving Kumbanda's motives. Daonce decided there was no time for delay, and he left with Anilmo and a small entourage. I warned them not to go, but....</p>

          <p>So...even the Dragonbound are bound by Beritra.... But based on what you've told me, the seeds they use are weaker than those planted in Villaire. Not strong enough to contaminate all Brusthonin, but enough to control one man.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In any case, Valetta was correct. Our research has been fruitful, and has led us to this: the Scepter of Purification. If the seeds have not fully sprouted in the Reian Anilmo, he might be saved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, this Scepter is empowered by Lord Triniel, so I am not sure how it will affect a Reian tribesman. Perhaps you should speak with this [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Belik] you mentioned. He might have some insights.</p>

          <p>This Scepter can nullify brainwashing? Hmmmm.... I don't feel anything. But I suppose that's good. There are no ill effects on my kind. With this, perhaps you can indeed save not only Anilmo, but the others....</p>
