          <p>Have you ever seen anyone resembling the man in the portrait? Perhaps imagine him without the beard?</p>

          <p>No? Please, think harder! Anything you can tell me would help.</p>

          <p>His name is Svasuth. Perhaps you've heard of him? No? That's surprising; he's one of the most well-known bards in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm his chief attendant. He almost passed out at Apellbine Tavern a while ago and I had to drag...er, escort him home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I went to his room to check up on him the next morning, he and his suitcase were gone! He has a sort of wanderlust, you see.</p>

          <p>I do. I went straight to Doman, the Teleporter, but he hadn't seen Master Svasuth. I searched every inch of Pandaemonium, but nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then a Shugo trader told me that he'd seen Master Svasuth headed for a battleship coming here to Gelkmaros. I came right here, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now I'm not sure what to do. I need to keep searching, but I'm only one man. Could you...help me out?</p>

          <p>I heard someone named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Notud] could have information. You should start with him.</p>

          <p>Svasuth? He's my favorite bard of all time! I'd recognize him anywhere! And yeah, he was here in Gelkmaros!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He actually talked to me! Me! He asked me if there were any waterfalls nearby, so I told him about Gelkmaros Falls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked me to take him there, but I told him that the Air Line can't go there. He shrugged and took off. I actually met THE Svasuth!</p>

          <p>Thank Aion you're back. I half expected you to take off and leave me in the lurch. Master Svasuth sure does.</p>
