          <p>That would be like carrying around a Stigma Stone in your cube. Pretty, but pointless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead of that, why don't you use it to reinforce the Jewel of the Judge?</p>

          <p>Exactly, the Jewel of the Judge. A legendary item, but it can be made more potent with Kromede's Flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, you'll also need a blacksmith, but I think I can squeeze you in between jobs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You get me the Jewel of the Judge, I'll make it better. Promise.</p>

          <p>A fine decision. Now, as to that Jewel of the Judge....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard someone whispering that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple has it.</p> 
          <p> </p>	
          <p>I don't know if that's true, but you might want to check it out. It would seem to make sense. Her being a Judge and all.</p>

          <p>I know, you're thinking, "Why would I want only one jewel when I could have both a necklace and a Jewel of the Judge?"</p>

          <p>Well I'll tell you why. More is not always better. Don't believe me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, then hand over that Kromede's Flame and I'll smash it into a thousand little jewels. That would be better, right?</p>

          <p>Don't weep for Kromede.... She's been taken over by grief and hate. She doesn't deserve your compassion anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's neither here nor there. Give me the Jewel, along with Kromede's Flame, and then step back.</p>
