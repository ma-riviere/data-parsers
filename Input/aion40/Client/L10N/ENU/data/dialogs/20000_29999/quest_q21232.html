          <p>Blast! I've just returned from the Crimson Temple, and it's been overrun!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos and the Balaur are both scrambling for control, and there's no way I'm letting some snot-nosed twiggy or ornery scaleback seize hold of Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The temple must be retaken, and by Azphel's shadow I will see it happen.</p>

          <p>The Vorgaltem Battlefiled is a tactical nightmare--the terrain is near impossible to defend no matter who holds it. We could pussyfoot around and try to mount a coordinated attack, but I prefer a more direct approach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We skip all that strategizing nonsense, march straight to the Crimson Temple, and slay the Guardian General.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That ought to make the enemy think twice about crossing Asmodae. What do you say?</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Getting to the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_21232] should be simple enough. Slaying it will be more difficult. Gather your allies, and steel your resolve.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've slain the Guardian General and retaken the temple, report to Cozett. She should be in the area, and will no doubt reward you for your bravery. Now, get moving before the enemy has a chance to mount a defense!</p>

          <p>That was one heck of a battle, [%username]. Many of my allies fell, but now the Crimson Temple is under our control.</p>

          <p>There's much to be done to shore up our defenses.</p>
