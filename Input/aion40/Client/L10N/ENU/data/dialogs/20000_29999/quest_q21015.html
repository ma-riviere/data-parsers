          <p>This is a hallowed place, [%username]--a place of great tragedy and honor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After Lord Marchutan raised Gelkmaros Fortress, this is where the Balaur made their stand. Many legions, and even Mastarius himself, engaged in battle here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My old legion was among them. We fought as day broke, and were still in the midst of the same battle when the day ended.</p>

          <p>You understand! Good!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As far as you could see, the ground was choked with Balaur corpses. I'd never seen anything like it. It was terrifying, yet my heart filled with pride for Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd suffered as well, of course, but we triumphed. And in the Balaur's home territory, no less.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Since then, everyone who was there has been working tirelessly to bring about final victory here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We all have our role, no matter how small. One of mine is to keep the bulwark in shape. Every second it defends against Balaur assault could be vital.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, we were about to start some repairs. As long as you're here, do you mind assisting us?</p>

          <p>Really? Thank you! It's not often a great Daeva like yourself deigns to help the common soldier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vyuin and I can do the actual repairs. The hard part is finding materials strong enough to make them with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_DrakanDebris_Q21015] scattered about near here is perfect. Scavenge enough, and we can start work.</p>

          <p>Hm. You seem to underestimate the amount of repair needed. The Balaur attack constantly, so the bulwark gets damaged often.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't wait around for Pandaemonium to send proper building materials--[%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_DrakanDebris_Q21015] is the best we can find around here on short notice.</p>

          <p>Ah, yes. This is perfect. I'll take these to Vyuin. Hopefully they won't fall on his foot. Again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said, gathering these is the hard part. The repairs should go very quickly now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for the help. It was unexpected, but appreciated.</p>

          <p>Danomdel recalled the battle that gave Asmodae a foothold in Gelkmaros. He then mentioned that one of his duties in maintaining that foothold is to keep the bulwark in good repair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In recognition of his past bravery, you helped him out by gathering debris to use in repairs. Danomdel was surprised, but appreciative.</p>
