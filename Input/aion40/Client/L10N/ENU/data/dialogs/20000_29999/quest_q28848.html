          <p>The smart brains up in Pandaemonium have bred a new Guestbloom, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're giving them out to Daevas who've performed certain missions. Turns out I get to give one of them out! Exciting, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, turns out there are poisonous plants spreading along the Trepone Village Road in Sarpan. Get that problem under control, for me, and I'll give you the new Guestbloom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to go to the Trepone Village, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Fungy_Flower_57_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_Dionae_DR_56_An]s, and collect their roots as proof. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Excellent. And for killing lots of plants, you get one of your own in return. Lucky you, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, give it lots of Fertilizer. You never know what might spring up!</p>
