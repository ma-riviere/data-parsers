          <p>I am a Daeva of Emotion, [%username], and know that a great deal can be inferred from the smallest detail. A raised shoulder with a statement betrays the lie; a quickly consumed drink implies nerves.</p>

          <p>I can teach you to understand these signs, if you like. Then perhaps you'd see that standing this close to someone could be considered rude.</p>

          <p>Excellent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, I want you to read this manual. I wrote it myself, and while it's not long, it does contain the basic principles of expression through movement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you are done, then I will teach you.</p>

          <p>Ah, good! I'm glad that the more salient points were not lost on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's time for your lesson. This will enable you to change the way you move about this world, though as ever, you must be aware of how others will perceive you now.</p>
