          <p>Not everyone gets to be the hero, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've been everywhere and have done everything. You've slain Balaur, fought in countless battles, seen parts of the world that I will never go to. I manage a warehouse. But you know what? I'm okay with that. My role may not be as pivotal as yours, but we are both cogs in the same machine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I want to help the war effort in any way I can. I usually make medicine, but I've recently run out of supplies. Perhaps while you are out in the field, you could collect the ingredients I need? All I need is a few [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_22010a]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Spider_Leaf_58_An]s in Edendell.</p>
