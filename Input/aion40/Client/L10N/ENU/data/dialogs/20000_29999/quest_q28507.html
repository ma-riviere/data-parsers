          <p>So yes...talk lots. Okay. Where to start...where to...ah! Beginning!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always wanted to be free and independent Shugo. Association always want cut of pie, and I thought, "Why should I give you pie, if I make pie?" Hamerun visits me one day, and offers me more pie! Double pie! Almost triple pie!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I thought. And I thought. And then thought a bit more. And then Hamerun kicked me, and I said yes.</p>

          <p>Hamerun look like you. Furry mane, red eyes, black wings...but inside Hamerun is something terrible...yes yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See...Shugos are opportunists, but Hamerun...worse. Much worse. Lust for Kinah drives everything. No morals. No spirit. Hamerun chose me because I have ways with Skurvs and Kobolds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, after we got all the Skurvs and Kobolds here, Hamerun had no need for me. Took my ability, put me aside like an old toy, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Plan? To make money, to take over parts of Atreia money...yes yes. Lust for Kinah drives Hamerun, and Kinah drives Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you could stop that now, Daeva! You could find Hamerun now while he has little protection! Free us all from his grip, maybe?</p>
