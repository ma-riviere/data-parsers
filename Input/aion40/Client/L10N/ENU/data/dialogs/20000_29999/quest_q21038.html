          <p>Don't be fooled--some manastone removers go on as if their work is so hard, but it's nothing but bluster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Manastone removal isn't very hard--the process is quite straightforward, and anyone can learn to do it with a bit of training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But just because something is easy doesn't mean it's not important. Imagine if there was no one at all who could remove manastones.</p>

          <p>At any rate, I suspect you're here because you heard about the new manastone exchange program, right? Did you want to trade more manastones in?</p>

          <p>The policy is similar to the last exchange, but the types of manastones we are accepting for trade is different now (MP +70, Evasion +14, and Parry +22).</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The type and value of manastones to exchange must be identical. If even one manastone is different, I can't do the exchange. Rules are rules.</p>
