          <p>Listen up, [%userclass]. We all know what you've done and how powerful you are, but your strength means nothing if you don't know how to use it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, Tiamaranta has specifics that make it a different warzone than any other you've faced before. You're powerful, of course, but you still need training. Governor Skafir ordered me to help you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready to get started?</p>

          <p>Excellent. That's what I like to hear, [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I'm sure you know the basics about the four Hearts and how we can only attack Tiamat once they've been subdued, but there's a lot more than that to learn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kroh] will get you started. Speak with him now.</p>

          <p>Dragan sucked you into his training, eh?</p>

          <p>Way I see it, if you can't figure it out yourself, you don't deserve the glory for doing it. But what do I know? I'm just a daft instructor with attention issues.</p>

          <p>Haha! A joker! I don't know whether to punch you or pat your back. Maybe we'll be friends after all, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now remember, this is a race to recover Siel's Relics. We cannot fail. We're technically at peace with the cowards, but we all know that once Tiamat is dealt with, old scars will soon start to ache again. And when they do, whoever holds the Relics will have the upper hand and will surely win this bloody war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to take control of the Hearts, then assault Tiamat. Don't you ever forget that. Now go, speak with Briet.</p>

          <p>Fair answer. What's next... ah, artifacts. The artifacts there either affect one of the Hearts or affect the Balaur directly. Controlling the Hearts requires intelligent movement, perfect artifact activation timing, and, of course, raw power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're the key, [%userclass]. Without the artifacts, you will struggle to control the Hearts. Without the Hearts, you cannot assault Tiamat. Without killing Tiamat, you cannot recover the relics, and without the relics, we will likely be crushed by the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're done. Speak with Skafir.</p>

          <p>Well then! Your previous accomplishments cannot be denied, [%username]: you are a guiding force to the Asmodian people. But, even the strongest can fail if they cannot properly utilize their strength. That is why I had you speak with my trainers.</p>

          <p>You were summoned by the Tiamaranta Training Instructor Dragan. He told you about the specific differences found in Tiamaranta compared with the rest of the world. Kronos then explained how to occupy sources, and Briet spoke about Artifacts.</p>

          <p>You listened and understood everything, earning the trust and thanks of the Governor, Skafir.</p>
