          <p>The Balaur kill. It is unpleasant, but it is direct, and swift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragonbound have a fanatic's sadism. They kidnap, torture, and only eventually kill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worse, their predations sometimes twist their victim's mind, turn them into a fellow Dragonbound fanatic. Thus the cycle widens.</p>

          <p>But we need more power to move against them. Did you know that before the Cataclysm, the Jotun followed the will of Aion?</p>

          <p>I believe their might could be brought to bear against Aion's enemies once more. But to do that, you need to infiltrate the Udas Temple. Can you do this?</p>
