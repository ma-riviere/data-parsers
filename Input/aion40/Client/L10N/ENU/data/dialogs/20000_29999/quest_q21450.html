          <p>The General here issued a ban on entering Taloc without permission. Theilo ignored it, and now he's like this. The Aether addiction....</p>

          <p>That's what we call it. Daevas are exposed to large amounts of Aether inside Taloc, so their bodies start demanding unreasonably high levels all the time. They go into withdrawal once they can't get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But just as Taloc introduces the problem, he introduces the solution: tea brewed from Taloc's Young Leaf. Trouble is, he stopped growing long ago, so such leaves are rare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there are spots of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Seed_Q11450] where [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21450a] can still grow.</p>

          <p>Indeed. But you have permission to go inside Taloc. You seem to be able to resist Aether addiction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you'd need to do is pat down patches of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Seed_Q11450] that you find. A [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21450a] should sprout.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need five to make the tea. Could you do this for Theilo?</p>

          <p>It won't be easy finding parts of Taloc with the energy needed to sprout [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_21450a], but it's Theilo's only hope.</p>

          <p>Of course, Theilo's a Daeva, so he won't die from this. But until he is cured, he will suffer eternal agony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think that's almost crueler than simply dying. And there are many who suffer his fate.</p>
