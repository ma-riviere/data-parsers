          <p>There's something here of great power, I can feel it. Those Drakan of the Satra Legion keep showing up, though. Maybe they can feel it, too. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Kahrun's Eyes, [%userrace], if it weren't for their constant intrusions, I'd be able to find the relic. Imagine what kind of power we might possess with it! It could win us the war!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only we could keep them out of our way--even for just a little while. Would you keep the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_DrakanFi_Tiamat_60_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_DrakanSc_Tiamat_60_An]s at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T4_A3] busy while I find the relic?</p>

          <p>We should be able to find the relic in no time, now. May Siel's Spear guide us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to take care, here. Too much haste could destroy countless historical artifacts. But... a powerful relic could turn the war in our favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, the Satra Legion won't be back.</p>

          <p>You met Taladin who was trying to find a powerful relic, but the Satra Legion kept attacking the Siel's Temple Ruins. He asked you to keep them busy to give him time to find the relic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You invaded the Satra Legion Garrison and killed the Enforcers and Stalkers you found. Taladin appreciated your efforts, saying that the ruins would be safe for a while.</p>
