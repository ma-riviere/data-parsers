          <p>Day after blasted day, those dirt-munching, slime infested [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Centipede_Crk_58_An]s interfere with my job. My other job as a researcher, I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The "best" part of all of this is that I'm actually here to study how anything can survive in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_000]. </p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>The Laupedes interest me least of all! Insects are insects, and the fact they survive here is no more surprising than the fact they survive anywhere else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, if you were to scratch my back by, say, wiping out those Laupedes, I'd be more than happy to compensate you.</p>

          <p>While you were gone, another one of those things came and decided I looked like lunch. I'm still cleaning the slime off my knuckles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ugh. I'll clean them later. How did you do?</p>

          <p>Excellent. You know, I was thinking of cutting off one of their heads, and wearing it like a hat. Maybe make the others think I'm Queen Laupede. Then I thought about the slime dripping down my back...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I promised you something, didn't I? Here, take these, fresh from our supplies cabinet.</p>

          <p>Moraitia, a refugee coordinator/researcher in the Twisted Chasm, complained to you about the Goldenjaw Laupedes, and how they were interrupting her studies. You offered to help, and killed off some, receiving a fair reward in return.</p>
