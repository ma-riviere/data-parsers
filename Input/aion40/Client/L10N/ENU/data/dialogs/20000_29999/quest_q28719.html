          <p>Aimah's Spellbook is an exquisite weapon, indeed. But what if I said it could be better?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You would be unstoppable. No one would dare to stand against you. Entire legions would pause before your might.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finding [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18711A] is not for the weak or the faint of heart, though. If you CAN find Paruam's Iris, take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zaellen]. A truly remarkable weapon awaits!</p>
