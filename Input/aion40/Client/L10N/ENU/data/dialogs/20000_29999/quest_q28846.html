          <p>I wish Mama and Papa had more time to play. Grown-ups are always so busy! So many of my friends' Mamas and Papas are in places like Gee-kel-ma-roos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Papa is always home, though. He works as a... what was it? Oh! Con-struc-tion Mer-chant! I learned that all by myself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He works at the studio all day, and then he comes home, and then we play!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet he'd love to get visitors, though! Mama said his name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gapion]. Wanna go see him? Pretty please?</p>

          <p>Oho, so you met Marizia, did you? Such a sweet girl; reminds me so much of her mother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad we can raise her here, away from the worries of war. Hopefully we can introduce her to reality gently.</p>

          <p>Oh, yes! It's about much more than just furniture, you know. Anything that goes in or on a house, that's my job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, the studio is running a little promotion. You get a free gift just for stopping by, to encourage you to return.</p>

          <p>It's a Construction Flux Hearthbloom. Raise it with fertilizer, and you'll get Construction material. Try it out, with Azphel's blessings.</p>
