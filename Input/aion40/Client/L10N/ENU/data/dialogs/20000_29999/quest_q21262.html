          <p>Mastarius was very impressed by your actions in defending Gelkmaros. He mentioned you by name, not just to me but also to Lord Marchutan himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are whispers in Pandaemonium of special recognition for all of you who fought there. I must say I'm a bit envious.</p>

          <p>With the Elyos dazed from their defeat at your hands, we have the perfect chance to turn the tables and invade Inggison.</p>

          <p>Can we count on your aid? I've been told to offer an item to enchance the power of your Polearm.</p>

          <p>This is an exciting time. But we must not let our guard down; the Elyos may be fools, and the Balaur may be evil, but neither of them are weak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nor are they as strong as proud Asmodians, however. The shadow of defeat, so quickly turned into the promise of victory.... You have done well.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Polearm.</p>
