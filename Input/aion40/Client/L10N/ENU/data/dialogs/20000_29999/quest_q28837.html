          <p>So many use Hearthblooms and Guestblooms that they don't even realize how little we know about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ever tried to apply Hearthbloom Fertilizer to someone else's Hearthbloom? Doesn't work, does it? Why not?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nobody knows. That's why my particular field of research is particularly interesting, no matter how mundane others think it.</p>

          <p>A... Shining Sprout! And you're giving it to me, not one of the Bloom horticulturalists?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a rare opportunity! Guestblooms are so in demand that I can hardly get a chance to find young plants, let alone sprouts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will be a great boon to my studies. I'm honored that you thought of me.</p>
