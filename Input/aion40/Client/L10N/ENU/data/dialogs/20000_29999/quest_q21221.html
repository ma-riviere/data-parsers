          <p>Oh my. This is...this object... It predates the Cataclysm.... You said you found this in the Petralith Canyon, [%username]? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a fascinating find. I would love nothing more than to investigate myself, but my responsibilities here keep me preoccupied. Indefinitely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this could be very important. I need to locate a scholar in the area.... Blast this personnel shortage.... Ugh, not Tanar.... Itar is occupied...aha! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Helen] is near there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was one of the brightest scholars I'd ever met, but now she's a Dramata Chaser. No idea what that is, but evidently it's important to her. Ask her to investigate this device, and give her my regards. </p>

          <p>Wait...what's this...I've seen this before.... Reshanta comes to mind.</p>

          <p>Well.... I don't like shirking my duties as a Dramata Chaser, but this looks important. I can't imagine where or even when it came from, but I'll take a look.</p>
