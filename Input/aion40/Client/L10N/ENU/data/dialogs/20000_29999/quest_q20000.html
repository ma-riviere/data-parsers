          <p>I am pleased that you came so promptly. It is not I, however, who needs you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of Agehia? Once a well-known Shadow Judge, now she is a High Priest serving Empyrean Lord Marchutan in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC2], deep below the surface of Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Agehia asked me to recommend someone reliable for a special mission, and I immediately thought of you.</p>

          <p>I suggest you discuss that with High Priest Agehia instead of me. I have other matters to attend to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know how to get to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC2]? There are two teleport statues near the entrance to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC1_1]. The one made of gold will take you to Agehia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That will be all, Daeva. Blood for blood.</p>

          <p>...for my special mission? Hmmmm...I expected someone a bit taller, but I suppose you'll do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may already know that Empyrean Lord Marchutan is not here at the moment. He is currently staying at Gelkmaros in Balaurea, dealing with an issue critical to the future of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Marchutan has asked me to select several Daevas to assist with the efforts there. I spend so much time here, though...which is why I asked Vidar for his help. He knows the Daevas of this city far better than I.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you will not disappoint either of us. Or Lord Marchutan.</p>
