          <p>Hey, wait up. I wanted to tell you something about Kromede's Tear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a terrific necklace, I'll give you that, but there's something more you can do with it if you want.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The materials used to make it have a special connection with one of Kromede's weapons.</p>

          <p>Well, if a talented blacksmith--say, me--were to fuse it with the Warhammer of the Judge, the warhammer will become much stronger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need to do is get said warhammer, and I can perform the fusion for you. Are you interested?</p>

          <p>Oh, as for the Warhammer of the Judge, the real [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] still has it.</p>

          <p>You'll find her at the Fire Temple in Morheim. I don't expect she'll be friendly, though.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>

          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
