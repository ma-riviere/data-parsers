          <p>Glad you could join me. Usually, I see people passing by down below, and they don't even see me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even when they're riding the windstream, they don't have any need to stop here, so they just keep on going.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's nice to have a little company for a change.</p>

          <p>Yes, but I don't have time to enjoy the peace. I have a job to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My task is to monitor the windstreams and geysers in the area. My superiors consider them vital to military operations here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I keep an eye out to make sure they're flowing well and going where they're supposed to go, so Daevas can use them without worry.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Especially since the Twilight Drana Farm is nearby. That makes for a lot of potential meddling by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of my big problems is Glittering Seafoams. Their energies can affect the course and strength of windstreams, and they attract Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But their home is out of the way, and I can't leave my post for that long. Can you help?</p>

          <p>Good. You're doing a lot of Daevas a big favor. The better the windstreams work, the better off we all are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Foam_DR_55_An]s make their home in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C1_Cave]. You just need to reduce their numbers some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that won't be possible as long as [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C1_Foam_DR_Nmd_55_An] lives. It births the blasted things constantly. I think you know what to do about THAT.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Well, if you don't do it, someone else will have to. Left unchecked, those Seafoams will cause huge headaches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should put in a request to Gelkmaros Fortress. They know better than Pandaemonium the importance of the windstreams.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stay as long as you like. As I said, I don't get much company up here.</p>

          <p>Welcome back! One of the nice things about this post is that you can see visitors coming from a kilometer away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It makes it pretty hard for anyone to sneak up on you, friend or foe.</p>

          <p>You don't seem like the type to give up easily. That must mean the Seafoam threat's been dealt with.</p>

          <p>Excellent! With Cobaltan dead, the Glittering Seafoam numbers should drop naturally to manageable levels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe now I won't get those Balaur constantly coming over to investigate the light the Seafoams give off.</p>

          <p>You deserve a reward. How about...hmm, take this. Hope it comes in handy.</p>

          <p>Gustava's task is to keep windstreams and geysers doing what they are supposed to do. Unfortunately, Glittering Seafoams are interfering with his ability to do so.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You rode the geyser in Viscum Swamp to the Genesis Cave, and killed both Cobaltan and many Glittering Seafoams. You returned to Gustava's thanks.</p>
