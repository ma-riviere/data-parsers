          <p>I'm satisfied by Daeva's effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, I didn't expect you to do this well, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how much you've been told, but the place the Daevas are looking for must be here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is where Kobolds kidnapped from Elysea and Skurvs from Elysea are incarcerated and put to physical labor, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The labor is to produce and process Odium and Odella and extract Aether!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is called Haramel, a secretive worksite just for this purpose, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you want to know the structure of Haramel, too?</p>

          <p>Haramel is not that wide, but it's wide enough to produce Odella and Odium, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>District 1 is for Kobolds to unearth and process Odium. District 2 is for Skurvs to cultivate and process Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Odium and Odella go through chemical treatment, put in a box and moved to the tower, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's probably moved somewhere with a pulley in the tower. But I haven't been there in person, so it beats me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gestanerk must be below the pulley. Ask him the details, nyerk nyerk.</p>

          <p>This makes us even, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not ask me any more questions. It's been a long time since I had business with Gestanerk. I'll tell you that much, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh right. If you get to meet Gestanerk, tell him that I'm sorry. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the by, Gestanerk should squirm if he sees a Daeva for his past sins. Nevertheless, he'll run around in Haramel. It shouldn't be difficult to catch him, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(Lowering his voice) The way I see it, there's some dark scheme going on beyond just Gestanerk. Don't give him too much of a hard time, nyerk.</p>

          <p>If I tell you what you want, will you let me off the hook?</p>

          <p>If the Association finds out about this... I'm a dead Shugo! Everybody makes mistakes. Please, I'm begging you. Instead, I'll give you information on Hamerun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hamerun is powerful and evil Asmodian Daeva. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he learned I have an ability to make the Sapiens follow my orders, he lured me into doing business with him. But after he absorbed my powers, he took the lion's share and had me do errands for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've always wanted to wash my hands of this. Now I'm just helping him as the middleman in some trading, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the elevator and you'll find Hamerun on the upper floor. I don't care whatever you do with him. But you must count me out!</p>

          <p>I've never heard of Hamerun before. Who the heck is that guy? I feel uneasy knowing that he ran away.</p>

          <p>I'll have my subordinates investigate Haramel and track down Hamerun.</p>

          <p>I'll report this to Centurion Morn firsthand. He should be very pleased as our guesses are proven to be correct.</p>
