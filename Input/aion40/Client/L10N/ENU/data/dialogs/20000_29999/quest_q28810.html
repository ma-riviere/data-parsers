          <p>The house I've long dreamt of is now up for auction. I want to go to Sarara to place a bid, but I can't until I've finished my work today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sarara], and tell her to place a bid on my behalf? I'll be there soon to complete the arrangements.</p>

          <p>Are you planning to buy a house? You've stopped by at just the right time. Many good residences are up for sale now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usually people are only interested in popular houses. Rarely do people bid on unknown ones, though the quality is the same. Houses gain popularity when their owners add special decor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's wiser to select a house that suits you best, rather than buying what others like. You'll spend less when you bid, and can improve your house over time.</p>

          <p>Ah, I understand her anxiety. She's been waiting for that house to go on the market for a long time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, a bidder must place a bid in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for delivering her message all the same. If she truly desires this house, she will find a way to place the bid herself.</p>

          <p>You accepted Moren's request and met Sarara, who explained bids can only be placed by the purchaser.</p>
