          <p>I wish I could give it to you, but I threw it away a long time ago. If only the nightmare had gone with it!</p>

          <p>Bridget said I had to go inside my nightmare to be free of it, but I'm not courageous like you. I'd probably die in there and be lost forever!</p>

          <p>I heard you came to the end of your nightmare, so it wouldn't be that difficult for you to go in there again. It's a lot to ask, but could you enter my nightmare for me?</p>
