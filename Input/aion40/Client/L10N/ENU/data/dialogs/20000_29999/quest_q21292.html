          <p>Your presence here signifies something important. Perhaps an end to Padmarashka's terror? Perhaps. Many have tried, and lost something of themselves in the process. May you fare better, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are truly the ones who can defeat it, perhaps you can also help me.</p>

          <p>My cohorts and I are here in search of something precious. Most Daevas assume that it must be a weapon, or a jewel, but to the Reians, it is far more valuable than that. It is something that grows only here, and only we Reians have the understanding to identify and use it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not wish you to find it for me, only to clear the path of guards so that we can search in safety. If you are planning to battle Padmarashka, you will need to take care of them anyway. I am only asking that you return here when you've done so, and tell me that it is safe.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva! I may be able to find something in our stash of supplies that would make a fitting reward. Our sponsors were certainly generous when they outfitted our expedition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The guards I need you to destroy are Padmarashka's Elite Sentinels and Padmarashka's Elite Administrators.</p>

          <p>Pardon me if I offended. I'm unfamiliar with Asmodian ways. Perhaps there is a superior officer I should contact about such requests in the future?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish you luck in your endeavor. Perhaps when you have been gone for some time, I will send a scout to see whether you have cleared our path for us.</p>

          <p>Well, our sponsors will be very glad to hear that. Perhaps we will have time to gather enough to complete our assignment before the Drakan come to find out what happened to Padmarashka.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You offered to clear them out of the way, and he rewarded you with some surplus from the expedition's supplies.</p>
