          <p>Good news for you, [%username]. There's killing that needs doing, but my valuable time is required filling out these incident reports instead of cracking some nice Drak ribcages with my trusty mace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't want anything slowing us down when we move our legion against the Dragon Lord. The fewer Drakan in our way then, the better off we'll be against Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So. Take that [%mainslotitem] of yours down into the Legionary Antechambers and cut down some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanFi_Tiamat_60_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanSC_Tiamat_60_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanWi_Tiamat_60_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanCl_Tiamat_60_Ae] soldiers. Bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_12034a]s as consolation for not getting to hammer in those skulls myself.</p>

          <p>Hey, looks like you had good hunting out there, [%username].</p>

          <p>That just makes me resent you more, but hey, that's not your fault. It's my blasted fault for being so good at my job that I kept getting promoted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might be in for the same fate, if you're not careful. Good work, [%userclass].</p>
