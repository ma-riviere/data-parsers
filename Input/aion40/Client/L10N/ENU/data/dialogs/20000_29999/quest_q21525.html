          <p>It's quiet here.... Too quiet, if you ask me. Not that I hate being alone, but the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09] has been inactive of late.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>They're usually hammering away at whatever project they're usually working on. If they're not, that means they're up to something different, which can't be good for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't afford to leave the Jotun alone down there--not with Elyos activity also on the rise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Nepilim_R_58_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Nepilim_M1_58_Ae]s, and foil whatever they're up to.</p>

          <p>Wow, you wouldn't believe the noise you made down there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The constant sound of hammering and banging was reaching all the way up here! It's like the entire place was at work all at once!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seeing as I told you to go in and fight though... I assume that was actually the sounds of battle?</p>

          <p>Indeed! Nothing like a little cacophany to make you feel alive!</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>If I have my way, between you and other Daevas, the musical sounds of battle will be ringing around here all day and all night!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You more than deserve this reward! Hope I can ask you to assist me again in the future.</p>

          <p>Suris thought that the Jotun in the Debarim Petralith Studio were being too quiet. He feared they were up to something.</p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>At his request, you killed Jotun Blacksmiths and Jotun Handicrafters. Suris was comforted by the noise you made battling these titans.</p>
