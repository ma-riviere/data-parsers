          <p>If Raksha vanishes, those ominous rumors about Raksang will vanish as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Including the one about Raksha's resurrection, and not as a spirit. How would anything be different even if Raksha did resurrect?</p>

          <p>Raksha knows everything that happens in Raksang. He knows what you eat, who you kill, and how to get out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's my plan: if we enrage him enough, his anger will consume him. Then he'll make mistakes. Then he won't be able to hurt us or rampage from Raksang all the way through to Ishalgen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He travels with two underlings. Killing those will make eliminating Raksha Boilheart easy.</p>
