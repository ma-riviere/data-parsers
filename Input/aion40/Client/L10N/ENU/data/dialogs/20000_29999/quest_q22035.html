          <p>Shards! I just had 'im in my sight... an Elyos spy, skirting the north rampart. Gone now, though. They're creeping 'round down there, looking to steal crumbs of Asmodian intelligence or sink a dagger in us when we're busy lookin' the Balaur in their ugly faces. Seen 'em three times now, stealthing around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not likely they're walking 'round down there for their health.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll let you go after 'em, [%username]. Spot of generosity on my part. Hunt down the three I saw: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_NPC_Q22035A], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_NPC_Q22035B], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_NPC_Q22035C]. They'll be well hidden, if there's a brain in those lofty heads of theirs.</p>

          <p>Good. Thought you wouldn't have too much trouble with 'em.</p>

          <p>Fewer Ellie eyes on the ground means our work comes easier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've earned this reward, though myself, I think three dead Ellies is payment enough.</p>
