          <p>Welcome to Pernon, where there's a standing home for every Daeva. Better than the furshacks most Asmodians grew up in, anyway.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Katenon] has been waiting for you, [%username]. He said he needed to talk to you. He's the Manager of Tezz's House, so, if you have time, head to Pernon Plaza and meet with him.</p>

          <p>Tezz is always away from home due to his job. He's really busy. Of course, when he's out, I have the run of the place, so it's not all bad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, that's right. He asked me to deliver a message if I saw you, [%username]. </p>
