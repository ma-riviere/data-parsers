          <p>Thank you for help before, but....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are two leaders of Krall and Mau forces. Them I cannot forget or forgive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Krall is Edurtz the Crazed. Mau is Silverpaw. They are worst of worst.</p>

          <p>Yes. Edurtz tortured Shulacks and Kobolds, killing them slowly, laughing in their faces as they died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Silverpaw made children watch as his Mau killed parents, then took children away. We still do not know where they are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Refugees still have nightmares about them, wake up screaming. Every time they do, my heart hurts.</p>

          <p>Some refugees are afraid to start rebuilding, or be happy. They think Edurtz and Silverpaw will return, take it all away again.</p>
