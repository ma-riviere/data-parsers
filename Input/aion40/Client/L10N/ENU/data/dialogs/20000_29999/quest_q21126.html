          <p>I'm glad to see another Asmodian in a place like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From the looks of that [%mainslotitem], you've seen more than your fair share of battle. I could use your strength, [%userclass].</p>

          <p>I was sent here to support the Reians, but the job's been a lot bigger than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought those Dragonbound were just a few ragtag maniacs, but they're a fearsome fighting force, especially with brainwashed Reians on their side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've sent for reinforcements, but I have no idea when the fortress will have any to spare. Could you lend us your aid?</p>

          <p>You must have seen the Manticores on the way here. The Dragonbound use them to track, harry, and capture Reian tribesmen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's strange, because Manticores are very wild and normally untamable. I think the shackles on their legs have something to do with it. If I could examine them, I might be able to counteract their magic.</p>
