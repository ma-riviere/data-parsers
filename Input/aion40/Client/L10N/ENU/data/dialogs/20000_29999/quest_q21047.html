		<p>Unlike many other classes, we don't need to rely on our weapons to bash in the skulls of our enemies.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Nonetheless, a weapon is essential for a [%userclass], both to enhance our spells, and as a last resort for skull bashing....</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I admit, sometimes I envy those other classes.... I'd bash more skulls if I could. Well then, I'll take your 1800 coins now.</p>

		<p>Chest armor would be a wise investment, [%username].</p>

		<p>That armor you're wearing now.... Well, let's just say it's seen better days...though it's hard to imagine it HAD better days.</p>

		<p>It'll be 1200 Mithril coins for new chest armor, and I'd recommend it. I can't imagine any [%userclass] choosing to wear what you have on now....</p>

		<p>Ever tried to cast a powerful spell in uncomfortable pants, [%username]?</p>

		<p>I wouldn't recommend it. A comfy pair of pants is essential for travel, combat, and relaxation. That whole "enhancing spell power" business is just a bonus.</p>

		<p>It'll be 900 coins for pants. I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p>
