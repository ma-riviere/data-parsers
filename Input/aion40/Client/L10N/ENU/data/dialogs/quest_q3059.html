          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_ShugoMaleNMQ_50_An] was my trusted aide. He followed me so earnestly and would do anything I say. He knew all my secrets, carried all my wealth.</p>

          <p>Then...one night he kept feeding me drinks...next morning--or was it two mornings?--he was gone. Him and MY safe...my Kinah...my whole life's income, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Yes, but...Titirunerk is so fast...like he has wings on his feet.</p>

          <p>Nagrunerk has tried to catch him several times, but always failed, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, you must have faced many kinds of adversaries. Are you faster than Nagrunerk? Are you faster than [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_ShugoMaleNMQ_50_An]? Will you catch the criminal even Nagrunerk can't catch?</p>
