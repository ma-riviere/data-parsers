          <p>Experience, my winged friend. I used to come here with my wife. We loved to watch the airships come in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She died a long time ago. It's been many years since she stood here with me. She's returned to the Aether, and I'm left here to watch alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will be relieved when Azphel calls my soul back to the Aether, so I may see my wife's dear face again.</p>
