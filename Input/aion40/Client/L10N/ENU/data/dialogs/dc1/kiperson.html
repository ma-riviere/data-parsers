          <p>This passage joins Pandaemonium Plaza and Crandale District. It's just about the only connection between them. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium Plaza attracts some, shall we say...haughty...characters? Blasted bards...whereas the folks in Crandale District are a bit more down to earth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I far prefer Crandale District. You know where you stand there. That Araison and his admirers in the plaza get my feathers up.</p>
