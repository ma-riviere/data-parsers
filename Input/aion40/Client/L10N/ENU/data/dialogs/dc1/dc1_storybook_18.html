          <p>1. Introduction</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The current Asmodian criminal law system was established during the rise of Pandaemonium and has required few major changes since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Punishment is divided mainly into corporal and confinement categories, though judges often order special punishments for specific cases.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Corporal punishment' refers to harsh physical chastisement such as flogging, branding, forced transformation, and wing amputation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Confinement' refers to any deprivation of freedom, including forced labor, incarceration, and forced enlistment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Special punishments range widely from fines (minor) to deportation from the Aetheric Field (heinous).</p>

          <p>2. Corporal Punishment</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Flogging</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Common for slander, laying of curses, theft.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A light sentence for small crimes, with five severity levels from ten to fifty lashes. Judges also choose the weapon for the lashes based on severity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sentence is usually executed in an open public space.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During flogging, the convict may not wear armor, but is permitted clothing, as specified by the judge. If convicts cry out, they risk further strokes.</p>

          <p>Branding</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The purpose of branding is to identify the criminal publicly and indelibly for their crime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Marks are applied in a location easily seen and difficult to cover up, such as the forehead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usually applied in the case of crimes with widespread random victims, or those that offend the common conscience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, someone who violates public decency might be branded "Degenerate."</p>

          <p>Forced Transformation</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A punishment that both humiliates convicts and restrains their behavior.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The form chosen depends on the crime, its severity, and the place of commission. Most judges favor four-legged or crawling animals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ribbit form is particularly humiliating. Criminals often beg tearfully at sentencing for less severe punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In rare cases, a convict's freedom of movement must be restrained. Judges then use an Ampha shape, removing the convict's teeth beforehand, of course.</p>

          <p>Wing Amputation</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wing amputation is an ancient tradition from the earliest days of criminal law.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since flight was much easier before the Cataclysm, amputation had a huge deterrent effect on major crimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today, as Aether thins and our flying abilities diminish, its effectiveness decreases. However, wings are a Daeva's symbol, so their removal is still a major humiliation, in addition to disfigurement.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Hard Labor</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A convict may be confined in prison and forced to work for a set duration. Such punishment is appropriate for criminals with serious offenses but fair chance of reform.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If possible, convicts are assigned to demanding menial tasks, such as salt farming, or feeding forges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sentence often requires specific output, for example, to harvest 200 pounds of salt or turn out 60 steel ingots.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Floggings often accompany hard labor.</p>

          <p>Confinement</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Confinement serves to minimize a convict's influence on society by restricting contact, either by imprisonment or exile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Accordingly, many ideological or political offenders are confined, especially those who ignore the will of the Shedim Lords or cause social upheaval.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judges choose barren places with especially weak Aether such as wastelands, tundra, or distant islands for exiles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lesser offenders are usually confined by restricting their travel. Teleporters and flight transporters are notified of offenders' names to reduce possibility of transportation or teleportation services.</p>

          <p>Forced Enlistment</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Convicts enlisted as punishment for a crime generally serve a Legion in some undesirable location, usually a dangerous frontier territory or very harsh environment. In addition, uniform markings distinguish them from regular Legionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Convicts often enlist to avoid physical labor. Many regret their choice once they reach their destinations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This system has almost died out, owing to problems such as discrimination in supplies, low morale, and threat of rebellion.</p>

          <p>4. Special Punishments</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fines</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Monetary punishment for financial crimes and criminals, and the most common special punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In a common bribery, both the administrator who received the bribe and the person who offered it pay fines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In general, hard labor and fines are imposed together. Criminals pay ten times the bribe amount and perform physical work to atone for their crimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All fines collected go to assist the poor.</p>

          <p>Deportation from the Aetheric Field</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even judges have been known to shudder at the mention of this terrible punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A true death sentence, commonly used during the Millennium War for the worst offenses, but hardly known today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All related records are classified, only declassified on unanimous agreement by all former and incumbent Shadow Judges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shadow Court regulations forbid even mentioning specific cases of deportation.</p>
