          <p>All my life, I've devoted myself to learning. Even before my ascension, I loved to bury myself in books. But now I wonder if I've been wasting my time all along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've studied so much, and yet none of it applies to my real life. None of it matters!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I've ever done is study...as if that was the same as really living. I thought I knew all about the world, when all I really know is useless words! What monstrous arrogance!</p>

          <p>A woman asked me how a mechanical loom works. So, I recited all the things I've read about looms in my books. I explained about the shuttle, thread tension, how the power of Aether is worked in....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And her response struck me like lightning. She said, "I had no idea you knew so much about weaving, Excelin! I wish you'd make me a dress!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She meant well, but it was like a slap in the face. I can tell you the names of Pandaemonium's most famous artists, explain how pigment is made, but I've never even picked up a brush! I'm a colossal fraud!</p>
