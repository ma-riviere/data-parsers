          <p>I love my work. I've been doing this job for several decades now. I've learned to read peoples' tastes from just meeting them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the caterer, I meet all sorts of interesting folks celebrating the major milestones in their lives. There's nothing in life, or death, that can't be conveyed in a well organized banquet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, it's about time I was thrown a banquet, in honor of my years of service.</p>
