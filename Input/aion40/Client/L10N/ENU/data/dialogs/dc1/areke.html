          <p>I wish I didn't have to work today. I could do with time off. Business has picked up so much lately, I barely have time to spend with my wife. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ante works for Lanse, over at the Artisans Hall. Since I ascended, well, it's hard for me to talk to her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So much of my energy is spent providing services to Daevas that I come home exhausted. I feel like I've abandoned her somehow.</p>

          <p>I'm not so sure. She loves my wings, but I see envy and sadness in her eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But our fighting Daevas need my services now more than ever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll make it up to her somehow. I'll find a way.</p>
