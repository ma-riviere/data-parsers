          <p>I love summer. The hotter, the better. Especially when it's hot enough that the clothes come off. Mmmmm....</p>

          <p>Hey, did you know that there's a special summer event going on right now? Take Scorching Heat to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Elma].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She'll give some cool rewards in return, including stuff that's really difficult to find anywhere else. Me, I'll just enjoy the heat. Maybe I'll start disrobing a little, show off my own body....</p>
