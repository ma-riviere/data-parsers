          <p>Everyone is beautiful...but some more so than others. We're all children of Aion, but Asmodians who wear outfits not fit for a brigand, or who don't care for their hair or nails, are a blight on Asmodae! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then they complain that they aren't beautiful...hah! Beauty is something that you have to work towards, it doesn't just happen! Do they think I was born with this dashing countenance, these ravishing good looks? </p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Realizing beauty is about trusting and discovering one's innermost desires. We're all more beautiful than we think, [%username].</p>
