          <p>I should never have come here. In Altgard, my dreams were filled with the soaring architecture and the glorious Daevas of Pandaemonium. I would find friends here--true friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I ran away. Once I got here, it didn't take long to learn the truth.</p>

          <p>Pandaemonium is like a mother Worg--kind and tender to its children, but to anyone else--anyone unfamiliar--it shows its fangs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure, Asmodian communities are tight-knit, but no one here will give me the time of day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't fit in here, and since I left home, I don't belong there either. I don't know what to do.</p>

          <p>You clearly don't know my parents. Pandaemonium is kind compared to them.</p>
