          <p>Do you know the time? I'm supposed to meet someone when my shift ends, and I can't wait. I'm Birgite, by the way. My parents named me Ogon, but I changed it when I came to Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It just wasn't...me, you know? No flash. At least the City Guard armor has some style. You've got to be in shape to wear this stuff--gives me an excuse to work out at the Arena!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though it's sacrilege, I don't like being stationed here at the Temple. It's just so...quiet, and Prounin over there is about as interesting as an Angeline sprout. I'm sorry--what time is it again?</p>
