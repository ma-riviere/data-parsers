          <p>Let me tell you about shields, Daeva. The purpose of shield is to get hit, so you do not. But this makes shield all dented and ugly, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better idea--shield that gets used up, vanishes when all ugly and banged up. Then Daeva can come back, buy brand new shiny one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best part is these special shields are great value for price! Don't believe me? Go look for yourself. Just come back and buy after!</p>
