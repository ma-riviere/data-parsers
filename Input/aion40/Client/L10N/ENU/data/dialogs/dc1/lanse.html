          <p>Handicrafts are my life, [%userclass]! My life!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I was Human, I worked diligently at the crafting bench. Always pursuing perfection, always finding it just out of my reach. One day, without warning, I gazed into the glimmering heart of a jewel...transfigured...and I ascended! Now, praise the Five, I have eternity to practice my crafts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you care to join me? There's always room for another meticulous worker in this shop.</p>

          <p>You'd like to get some work done? Good. Just...don't take on a commission and then dawdle about. It tries my patience and my nerves when people skulk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't do that, would you? I can't stand it when my nerves go bad. My hands shake and I can't work and that just makes it worse...</p>
