          <p>When my son ascended, I was so proud. To see him as a Daeva...it made my heart soar! No more worry over my baby--he had become immortal!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then he was sent to the Abyss. That place where even a Daeva's soul can be swallowed.... It fills me with horror to know he is there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I pray constantly for his safe return.</p>
