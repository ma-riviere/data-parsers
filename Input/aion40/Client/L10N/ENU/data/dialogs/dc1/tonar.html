          <p>I had prepared to die. My mind was made up, I simply thought--I was old, I was going to die soon, but my family would be there to see me go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I ascended they were all so happy that I wouldn't die. I had to watch all them die instead--and I'm stuck in this old body forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I still don't know why Aion chose me to ascend. I just don't know what good an old man can do.</p>
