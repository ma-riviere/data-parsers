          <p> 1. Classification of the Tribes</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau live in small tribal communities, and each Mau tribe keeps the record of its own culture and history.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are currently seven Mau tribes, distributed throughout Asmodae. Depending on whether they are friendly to Balaur, they can be divided into the pro-Balaur Mau and the independent Mau. Red Mane and Silver Mane Mau are classified as independent, while the rest are considered pro-Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Based on the relationship with Zemurru, the first Mau hero, Mau can be divided into the ancient tribe and the new tribe. This will be further discussed in Chapter 2.</p>

          <p> 2. History of the Tribes</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ancient Mau were divided into the Claw tribe, Mane tribe, Eyebrow tribe and other minor tribes. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zemurru united all Mau then under the rule of Balaur. Under Zemurru's leadership, Mau flourished. However the tribes scattered after Zemurru died. Zemurru's children created new tribes such as Gray Mane, Red Mane, and Silver Mane.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Zemurru united the Mau, he took a wife from each tribe as part of his efforts to strengthen the unity of the Mau Nation. His first wife, Liagathan, was of the Mist Mane Mau, first among the Mane tribes, and first to join Zemurru.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Upon Zemurru's death, Liagathan returned to her own tribe and led the Mist Mane according to the matriarchal tradition of the Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Claw tribe, one of the most powerful of the ancient Mau, was said not to have been in favor of Zemurru's coalition from the beginning. Upon Zemurru's death, they were the first to depart from the coalition, and soon restored the close relationship with Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After the Cataclysm, the Claw tribe split into the Black Claw who served Balaur and the Ice Claw who served the Artifact God. The Hoarfrost Mau--once known as the Eyebrow tribe--formed such a secluded and isolated society that we know almost nothing about them, other than their remarkable magic abilities.</p>

          <p> 3. Distribution by Area</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1) Ishalgen</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Gray Mane Mau and the Dundun Skurv tribe co-inhabit the Dubaro Vine Canyon area and the Odella Plantation. The Gray Mane Mau tribe is relatively small. They live in a narrow area between canyons, unlike other tribes who inhabit the plains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Gray Mane tribe was founded by the son of Zemurru's second wife. During the Millennium War, they actively supported the Balaur, and are still hostile to Asmodians.</p>

          <p>2) Altgard</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Altgard is where Mau have prospered since ancient times. It is home to many of their sacred sites, including the Zemurru's Grave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the war against the Mau, many Mau tribes have been somewhat pacified. But, the Black Claw tribe still poses a considerable threat. They have been pro-Balaur since well before the coming of Zemurru. The Black Claw village and Black Claw Outpost are located in the east side of the Altgard Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To the west of the fortress lies MuMu Farmland and MuMu Village. Black Claw Mau protect them in exchange for the Odella they grow.</p>

          <p>3) Morheim</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Three Mau tribes occupy the south of Morheim. The Ice Claw and Munmun tribes inhabit the mid-west. The Mist Mane and Nunu tribes occupy the southwest, while the Silver Mane and BuBu tribes occupy the mid-south.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both the Ice Claws and Mist Manes are hostile to Asmodians. The Ice Claw tribe served the Balaur in the past, but since the Cataclysm they serve the Artifact God. Unlike other Skurv, the Munmun tribe who live with them cultivate ginseng.</p>

          <p>Mist Mane Mau have served Balaur since ancient times, and have been in nearly constant conflict with the Silver Mane tribe.  
          While Mist Mane Mau serve Balaur, Silver Mane Mau serve Zemurru and Mau ancestral gods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Territorial expansion sparked an all-out war between the two tribes, and most of Silver Mane Mau were killed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mist Manes were founded by Liagathan, the first wife of Zemurru, and the Silver Manes by the daughter of Zemurru's fourth wife.</p>

          <p>4) Beluslan</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Mane and Hoarfrost tribes inhabit the southeastern area of Beluslan. The pro-Balaur Hoarfrost tribe and the nationalistic Red Mane tribe were in conflict until the Hoarfrosts were annihilated by Balaur. The reason for this is not known.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Mane Mau, established by the son of Zemurru's third wife, evidences strong pride in independent Mau culture.</p>

          <p> 4. Conflict between the Tribes</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mau tribal conflict has been relatively minor and short-lived, except for the war between the Mist Mane and Silver Mane tribes in Morheim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some Mau researchers say that the complicated marriages of Zemurru were one cause of the deeply rooted hostility between the two tribes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zemurru favored his fourth wife, and  his first wife did not bear him a successor. These are considered to be some roots of the conflict. This does not, however, adequately explain the full range of inter-tribal tensions.</p>

          <p>Mau defend tribal territories, and do not identify themselves as a Mau nation, so when the Mist Mane and Silver Mane tribes lost their lands and were driven to the southwestern region by the Asmodians, the new habitat was not large enough for the two tribes, and the neutral territory between them was too narrow. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This unwanted closeness encouraged trespassing, poaching, and raiding on both sides, and eventually led to open war between the two tribes.</p>
