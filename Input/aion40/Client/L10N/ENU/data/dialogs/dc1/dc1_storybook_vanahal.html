          <p>Humans once used surnames to show family and relationships. They have fallen out of favor in Asmodae--some believe using family names creates friction, pride, or even social classes. Asmodians know that all people are created equal, so what need have they for surnames?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some Daevas live alone for periods much longer than a Human lifetime. Most blood relationships are fleeting. What does family mean when one is immortal? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once one has seen children, grandchildren, even many times great-grandchildren returned to the Aether...can blood still recognize blood? Thus the custom of surnames has gradually disappeared.</p>

          <p>The families of the Vanahal District are exceptions to the rule. Vanahal's Daevas proudly proclaim their family names. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most believe that blood doesn't matter--even though one is the child of Daeva parents, there is no guarantee of ascension. Families in Vanahal District have maintained their names by ascending for generations. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some chose their name from characteristics of their appearance, or after the name of the highest-ranking Daeva in their family; others, the name of the founder of their family. Their name becomes their pride, their identity.</p>

          <p>The Vanahal District was originally a residential area exclusively for Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mesiradeta, Daeva of Construction, named it "Vanahal" after constructing several beautiful mansions for Daevas who'd proven themselves in the war. The descendants of the meritorious retainers who served the Empyrean Lords occupy them still.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Kayderian family fought side by side with the Empyrean Lords in the days of the Cataclysm. We are among the most reputable families in Vanahal.</p>

          <p>Kayderian, founder of my family, ascended on the day when the Empyrean Lords were born of the will of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A nimble and skillful archer, he gloried in serving the beautiful but cold-blooded Lord Triniel. Like Lord Triniel, he killed many Balaur while flying above the Aetheric Field. His sharp arrows never missed a target.</p>
          <p> </p>  
          <p>In pictures depicting those days, Kayderian is always at Lord Triniel's left side--bow in hand.</p>

          <p>After the Cataclysm, Kayderian worked with Lord Triniel to reconstruct Pandaemonium. When the city was finished, Kayderian and his family were granted a mansion in Vanahal District in acknowledgement of his achievements. But, instead of retiring to a life of peace, he volunteered for the first Abyss exploration team and left to lead a Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Abyss at that time was a deadly place as there were no Obelisks. Kayderian's Legion did not return from the darkness of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Our family shed no tears when news of Kayderian's disappearance came. Rather, we were honored that he died in service to Pandaemonium. Now it is our tradition--the Kayderian family sheds no tears for the dead. </p>

          <p>After Kayderian's disappearance, his descendants took his name. Through generations, they served Lord Triniel and were founders of the Temple of Death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tienshue, grand-daughter of Kayderian and my great-grandmother, fought mightily in Elysea but also killed Elyos who crossed into Asmodae. Many Guardians returned to the flow of Aether on the end of her sword. Every Legionary who followed Tienshue was influenced by her passion. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For her achievements, Lord Triniel granted her an insignia which is now a family treasure. </p>

          <p>Many Daevas brought glory to my family. To list them all would fill volumes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All who are born into the Kayderian family vow to serve the Empyrean Lords and Pandaemonium. They are strictly educated, trained, and instilled with the sense of duty and honor necessary to achieve glory. Those who don't ascend live out their lives in service to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone born into the Kayderian family wishes to become a Daeva like Kayderian and to serve Lord Triniel.</p>

          <p>Some people say that children born into Vanahal families are forced into ascension like flowers in a greenhouse. But that's not it at all. We are born and bound to the service of Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are taught to become model soldiers, receiving intense and rigorous education from the time we can walk. People who do not have family honor to maintain can not understand the sacrifice that we make. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some judge us for our luxurious clothing and beautiful mansions. But extravagances are trifling things compared with the blood we shed as leaders on the battlefield. Life in Vanahal District does not come cheap.</p>

          <p>As a descendant of Kayderian, I know the purpose of my life is to serve Pandaemonium and Lord Triniel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course I know that many Humans and Daevas suffer from cold, hunger, and the threat of Sapiens. That is why we are driven to forge ahead and fight for Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My descendants will be educated, as I was, to ascend and be of service to Asmodians. They won't feel sorrow for the deaths of family members. They will regard dying in battle as an honor. Such has it been since the days of Kayderian, champion of Asmodae.</p>
