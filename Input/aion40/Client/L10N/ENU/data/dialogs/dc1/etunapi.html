          <p>Sometimes I come down here just to watch the airships. It's peaceful...and at the same time, terrible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My husband used to work on airships. He loved them since he was a little boy. Working on them every day was like a dream come true for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I miss him terribly.</p>

          <p>What? Oh...there was an accident. It was almost a year ago now. Three people fell. Daevas were able to catch two of them, but not my husband. It's not their fault, I know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I...I'm sorry, I shouldn't burden you with this. It's the kind of thing I need to deal with by myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for letting me vent.</p>
