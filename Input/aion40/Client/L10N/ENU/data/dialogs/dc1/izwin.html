          <p>The Hidden Library doesn't admit just anyone. Its contents are sanctified, and can only be seen by qualified Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which, I should add, you are not. It's nothing personal, you understand, but rules are there for a reason.</p>

          <p>The Hidden Library is not a place for literary tourists. The books and materials it houses are irreplaceable--a single page of some of them is worth more than the entire contents of many other libraries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not only the material value of the books. Some of the writings kept there are not fit for all eyes--shocking, revelatory texts that cannot be allowed to leak into the gossip of taverns and dockyards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, only officially permitted Daeva can enter the Hidden Library. Come back when you have received official permission. And I mean official. Don't try to scrawl a note yourself.</p>
