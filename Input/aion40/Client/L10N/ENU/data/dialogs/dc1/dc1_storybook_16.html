          <p>Since I was young, I was fascinated by the world around me. My curiosity knew no bounds--from a small wriggling worm to the twinkling light in the sky, I questioned everything. I consulted many masters and held my breath in admiration of their insight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This book is the record of my long research. I hope it will give as much pleasure to my readers as I found in writing it.</p>

          <p>Aether Analyzer</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deep in the Temple of Knowledge in Pandaemonium, there is a laboratory that few are permitted to enter. In this hidden place, the Aether analyzer is still running.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The invention of the Aether analyzer gave hope to scholars who were eager to solve the secret of Atreia's creation. This research, which began with the theory that everything is composed of Aether, has remained at the theoretical and philosophical level for quite some years.</p>

          <p>But now a new generation of researchers is exploring this question with innovative experiments. Many are sure that the mysteries of creation can be found by the Aether analyzer, and are all waiting anxiously for the results of the ongoing experiments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are attempting to recreate the conditions of the creation, and to analyze the processes that occur within the flow of the Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few Daeva protest that these questions intrude on ground intended only for the Lords themselves, but they have given us these tools, so surely they are challenging us to find the answers.</p>

          <p> A Suitable Time for ascension</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An interesting philosophical debate has raged for centuries over the best time for ascension. Of course, we know that nobody can choose when to ascend, and the circumstances of ascension seem to be individual to each Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone who ascends at an early age has more opportunity to develop and refine their skills. They have the learning capacity of youth and the ability to accept and adapt to their new place in life.</p>

        <body>
          <p>However, ascension at too early an age is tragic, because the Daeva will be frozen for all time as a youth. That Daeva will never fully experience the joys of life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Conversely, what about ascending at an older age? Maturity and experience is valuable to a Daeva as they begin their new life. They understand the consequences of their actions and are more careful as they make their way in this unfamiliar world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, ascending at an old age also has a few problems.</p>

        <body>
          <p>First, it isn't as easy for an older person to adapt to life as a Daeva. Their Human habits are too ingrained. Also, certain chronic diseases like arthritis continue even after ascension. The Daeva must therefore live with that pain for an eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Weighing these factors, it certainly seems to me that ascension is most advantageous for young adults who have moved beyond the impulsiveness of childhood, but still retain the flush and energy of youth.</p>

          <p> How to Create a Small Abyss</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Materials: Pure Aether Crystal, Hazy Cube, Timer, Explosive Device</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the transparent materials, make a solid cube with a length, width, and depth of 3 cells. Place artificial trees and structures inside the cube.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also inside the cube, secure a pure Aether crystal whose size is approximately equivalent to 1/10 of the cube's volume. Before securing it, chisel out a groove in the middle of the crystal so that it can split in two.</p>

          <p>Install the explosive device and associated timer around the Aether Crystal according to the diagram found in Appendix A of this book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the timer runs out, the explosive will split the Aether Crystal into two pieces. This should form a vortex that will absorb the trees and structures inside the cube, shunting them into an artificial Abyss.</p>

          <p> Vanishment Theory and Daeva Existence Theory</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vanishment Theory is a field of philosophy that rose in popularity after the discovery of the Abyss. Previous to this, it was impossible for a Daeva to be beyond the range of an obelisk, but with the discovery of the Abyss the question was raised: What happens to a Daeva's soul if it is released beyond the range of an obelisk?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The answer seems to be vanishment. Nothingness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course not all philosophers agree. Some believe that a Daeva's soul can find its way back to the flow of Aether no matter what.</p>

          <p>Daeva Existence Theory, developed under the proposition that ascension means an eternal life, was thrown into crisis after the many disappearances during the early exploration of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Existence Theory lost its persuasive power once Daevas killed in the Abyss failed to return to life. People began to doubt that it could be applied universally to every individual Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This doubt about the basic proposition that Daevas are immortal beings, coupled with concern about the idea that anyone could permanently disappear, gave birth to Vanishment Theory.</p>

        <body>
          <p>When considering the irrationality of this trend of disappearance, Vanishment Theory proclaimed paradoxically that one must live a life without regret. It also maintained that it is important to each individual to explore the meaning of their own existence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The acknowledgment of the fact that Daevas might also prove to be mortal led to Ascension Regression Theory, which says, "Let's look back to the time when we were Human."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, Vanishment Theory led us to examine our roots, and increased our interest in our present lives--as well as our will to live.</p>

        <body>
          <p>In the meantime, the rise of Vanishment Theory in philosophy produced various social trends. One such benefit is that we began to value the recording of history.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People became afraid that the loss of these Daevas would lead to a separation from the past, and began to believe that every history, whether official or not, should be recorded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Daevas published diaries for the record of their private histories, and the study of history became more popular than ever before.</p>

          <p> The Specialization of the Ampha</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Among the insects inhabiting Asmodae, I find the Ampha the most unusual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ampha lives alone in damp, shady places. It feeds on other animals and has a flexible jaw so that it can swallow an animal many times its size.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A peculiar thing is that once it becomes adult it buries part of its body underground and gives up its ability to move. Some say this is because the Ampha is territorial, but that's only a hypothesis.</p>

          <p>What is well understood and documented is the creature's hunting patterns. It lulls its prey into carelessness through deception, lying on the ground like a limp rag.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the prey approaches, the Ampha rears up and and stings the prey, injecting it with a powerful poison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The prey is quickly overcome, allowing the Ampha to swallow and digest its latest meal.</p>

          <p>One might ask, how does the Ampha locate its prey? The sensory organs of the Ampha are not well-developed, but they serve well enough. The Ampha can determine the exact direction and position of its prey at a distance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also remarkable is the creature's mouth. Its jaw is able to lock after biting, so it never lets go once it has bitten into its prey, even if it dies. Its inner mouth is lined with sharp poisonous thorns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In this respect, the Ampha is highly specialized for sensing and capturing its prey, and is one of the more dangerous creatures I have studied.</p>

          <p>I have carefully selected the subjects to include in this volume, but have had to sacrifice many more. Perhaps if this book proves popular, I may be persuaded to set down more of my knowledge in a second volume.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until then, Azphel watch over you, and I wish you the joy of exploration and learning.</p>
