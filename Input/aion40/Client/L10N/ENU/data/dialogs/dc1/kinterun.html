          <p>You're a Daeva. You're immortal. So what? Can you turn back the blasted clock?</p>

          <p>Time misspent is still spent. Make some bloody use of yourself! Put the hours in. Learn a trade!</p>

          <p>You could do worse than Armorsmithing. There's Kinah in it, but better, it's worthy work. Tough. Something to get your flamin' teeth into.</p>

          <p>Crafting armor's a noble trade. Respected. Nobody in Pandaemonium ever asks if we're pulling our weight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lads and lasses in the Abyss'll be glad of more armorers. You focus your life, you shield brave Asmodian backsides, and some days you even get paid!</p>

          <p>At risk of pointing out the bloody obvious, how exactly do you craft metal blasted armor with no skill in metal balfired Armorsmithing?</p>
