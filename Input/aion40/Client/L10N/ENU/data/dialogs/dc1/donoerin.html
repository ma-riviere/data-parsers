          <p>Shyeah, right. As much as you can be an actress and keep food on the table these days. This show is being supported by the government, since it supports war morale, but there's not much else going on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I usually work at the Arena selling snacks and trinkets during events. It doesn't pay a lot, but it gives me time to work on my acting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I get this part, I hope you'll come to the show!</p>
