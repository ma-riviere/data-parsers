          <p>Dearest father,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Roast Ribbit Eggs you sent me were delicious. Never before have I tasted something so wonderful. I would not have known such indulgence had I not met you, father.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am so lucky to have met you when I did, before it was too late for me. Whether we will it or not, you are my father and I am your daughter. I'll always cherish you, even though you broke my mother's heart.</p>

          <p>I want to stay by your side forever, so I will need these three items to make this dream come true:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, I want a Jade Marble. It's good for an old woman's health is very pretty. Mother would have agreed. Second, I want an Aether Headband so I can ascend and be a Daeva. We'll be father and daughter forever! Mother would have wanted it that way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last, I would like the special Wrinkle Remover that the Shugos make. It's expensive, but I think you owe me at least that much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your daughter, Harmone</p>
