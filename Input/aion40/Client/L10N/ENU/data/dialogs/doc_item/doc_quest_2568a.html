          <p>My dear Freyja,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How's life in Beluslan? It probably isn't easy keeping warm over there. You may be wondering why your brother is suddenly sending you this letter. Well, I'd like to ask a special favor. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that there is a mineral called Malek in Beluslan. I know that there are some strange legends about it, and most people keep their distance, but I'd really appreciate it if you could send me some good quality stuff. You may be able to get it from the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually I am making a special mace, and I think that mineral may help me. I'm counting on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From Pandaemonium, Your brother Freyr.</p>
