          <p>Emotions cannot be hidden, disguised, or simulated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those who fake emotion may fool some, but not all. After all, emotion is from the soul, and eyes are the window to that soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So always be true to yourself and others. Lying is a fool's escape that creates complications which must be rectified later. Better to be honest in all things: in your speech, mannerisms, and movement, whether you are standing, running, jumping, or resting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These first lessons can be read, but the rest must be taught.</p>
