          <p>Finally, an expedition is being sent to Tiamaranta. All my training has been leading up to this moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have scoured Atreia for Mother. I have even sent feelers into Elysea and Asmodae, with no success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamaranta is the only place left I have to search, and joining a Legion is the best way to get there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The nightmares still persist--the visions of Mother being dragged away by the Drakan, screaming for help....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finding her again, alive or dead, is worth any price I pay.</p>

          <p>Day 718 of search:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was rejected by the Zayedans, the Sandstorm Legion.... Basically every group I applied to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They all told me the same thing: my combat abilities were judged insufficient for the tasks expected in Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My best hope has been shattered. All those years in training.... wasted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised; I was never very strong or agile to begin with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only began training because I knew the Legions were the best way to find Mother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that I've failed... What now?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I've finally arrived in Tiamaranta. It is a dark, menacing place; the Legions were right to reject me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I paid nearly all of my life savings to a Shugo trader to be smuggled in with her cargo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She further told me (with a little more Kinah) that the Dragonbound can be found living in the southeast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've taken many risks to get to this point, but I only did what had to be done--and yet it's still not enough.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I have a lead in my search for the Dragonbound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They often use Manticores as pets and sentries. I found multiple Manticore tracks near the Steam Springs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They seem to all lead in the same direction. Their village must be very near.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the question remains: even if I find the village, what do I do then?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In all my research, I still haven't found a way to undo Dragonbound brainwashing, except one--and how could I kill my own mother?</p>

          <p>Day 733 of search:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came to Tiamaranta out of desperation. It was my last chance to find Mother, alive or dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I couldn't live with the nightmares, the guilt. No matter what, I had to at least see her again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On my second day spying on Avad Village, I saw a female Cleric on patrol.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was her. The years have etched more lines on her face, but there was no mistaking her. Mother....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, I found you. Finally!</p>

          <p>Day 734 of search:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have made a decision: I am going to approach Mother and stand before her as her son.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sight of me, the sight of her mirror.... Surely it must penetrate whatever cruel things the Balaur have done with her mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe her love for me, and mine for her, is stronger than evil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But... if I'm wrong... then I don't regret that either. I prefer oblivion to life knowing that Mother serves the Dragon Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I prefer oblivion if the alternative is an existence steeped in guilt and nightmares.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter what, it all ends today. I can only pray to Siel that it ends well.</p>
