          <p>Day 1</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every day here wears on. Even Medeus, who normally cheers the rest of us, seems disturbed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He received a letter from Sanctum, and hasn't been the same since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish there was an end to the bad news.</p>

          <p>Day 2</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Krall pushed us back to the manor gate. Medeus and some Daevas are trying to fight back, but they are outnumbered by Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Am I doomed to die here? Nyerk...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This was not what I left Sanctum for. I thought I'd just escape Changanerk and all the political maneuvering.</p>

          <p>Day 3</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today we heard someone--or something--screaming for hours. I'm hiding underground, with brave Jaku, but they will find us soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am afraid of dying but more afraid that the secret of crafting the 100-slot cube will be lost forever. How hard I worked to discover it...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not too late. I must write down my secret and hope that someone will find this and send it to Vindachinerk's Workshop...must hurry. They are coming...</p>

          <p>Materials: 6 square Orichalcum plates, 10 rectangular Adamantium plates with 7 grooves, 8 rectangular Adamantium plates with 9 grooves, and 2 hidden hinges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tools: Gold plate, Aether iron, Vindachinerk press, Aether injector.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Crafting Method</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>1. Assemble Adamantium plates in a lattice form. Place them under the press and process them both horizontally and vertically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>2. Connect 5 Orichalcum plates with the gold plate and put them together like an open box. Place the lattice made in Step 1 inside the box diagonally and nail the hinges on the door.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>3. Inject Aether into the box using the Aether injector, press six sides of the box with the same force and inject Aether once more.</p>
