          <p>1. Pollution</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We haven't made much progress on eliminating the land contamination. However, we have successfully developed a seed that can grow in contaminated soil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can produce enough of these seeds, we may be able to begin farming land that's currently considered unusable.</p>

          <p>2. Current Status of the Havenjark Farm</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After we got rid of Squiller, the Farm Manager, the number of undead in the area decreased dramatically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we continue to kill undead at this rate, we might have a shot at reclaiming the Havenjark Farm in the near future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've had some help from visiting Daevas, which has sped our progress.</p>

          <p>3. Elyos Resistance</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Elyos Guardians are still fighting us. Fortunately, their counterattack is not a serious threat to the Watch or Daevas, as the Guardians stay in the Vigrid Plains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, it's clear we must get rid of them before we can bring settlers to this area. I will ask Pandaemonium to address this problem, as the Watch and Wisdom Orb Legion cannot handle this alone.</p>

          <p>Though we still have the Elyos problem, we're making good progress toward our goals here. Overall, things are more stable each day, but we need resources and supplies to keep it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope we can complete the cultivation of southern Brusthonin soon and make it fit for settlers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope all is well with the Reaper Squad and Baltasar Hill Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of Darkness be with you.</p>
