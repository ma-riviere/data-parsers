          <p> I discovered this poison by accident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Although I should take credit myself, I will say it was a co-discovery with Quintus and Kato, for the sake of our friendship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Our first important discovery was that the ash of the incense that the Krall had been burning on the Altar of the Crimson Dragon reacted to Moonflower sap. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The three of us decided to write a journal about our research into this fascinating poison. -Garnis</p>

          <p> Poison Extraction</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> We gave the name "Meslamtaeda's Blood" to the poison we made on the Altar of the Crimson Dragon. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Meslamtaeda is the Crimson Dragon, one of the five Balaur Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The poison is produced by a complex process. I will explain the detailed extraction and curing processes in the next chapter. </p>

          <p> Meslamtaeda's Blood: Materials Required</p>

          <p> 1. The ash of the incense used by the Krall during rituals for the Balaur Lords (its composition is unknown.)  </p>
          <p> 2. White sap extracted from the ovary of a young Moonflower. </p>
          <p> 3. Cured Fungen spore powder.</p>

          <p> Why can Meslamtaeda's Blood be cured only on the Altar of the Crimson Dragon?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> At first, we first thought that humidity near the altar might be accelerating the process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> However, when we tried to make Meslamtaeda's Blood in other places with a similar humidity level, it didn't work, and we couldn't figure out why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Our best guess is that the mysterious energy from the Altar might affect the curing process somehow. -Kato</p>

          <p> What is the composition of the incense that the Krall use in their rituals for the Balaur Lords?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> In an attempt to find out, we have experimented with many materials, but nothing has yielded positive results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> This poison, which can be made only with the ash of the Krall incense, may contain Meslamtaeda's very essence. -Kato</p>

          <p> Our original goal was to make an antidote for Meslamtaeda's Blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> One drop of this deadly poison is enough to kill any creature. I am beginning to doubt that an antidote exists.</p>

          <p> Difficulties in Making the Antidote</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I have decided to reveal the secret of this fascinating but deadly poison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> To do so, I need subjects that are more resistant to poison, such as Daevas like us. -Garnis</p>

          <p> I was struck by a memory from the old days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> We were struggling to make an antidote for Parabotul, which was not so widely known then as it is now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Then, Garnis suggested a bold idea. He said that he would drink the poison, and by examining him we could discover an antidote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> We were getting desperate, so we decided to take this risk.  In the end, it paid off. -Kato</p>

          <p> Quintus' Departure</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Garnis and I eventually agreed to drink the poison. Having tried in vain to stop us, Quintus shattered all the remaining bottles, and returned to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I bear him no grudge; our plan must sound ridiculous to someone as prudent as Quintus. I do believe that this is necessary, if we want to do the impossible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> It will take several days to prepare more of the toxin. -Kato</p>

          <p> Day Three </p>

          <p> Garnis seems to have a skin disease. It is one of the most common early symptoms of poisoning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> His skin has lost its elasticity, and is darkening in color.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> But he will be fine. We will soon make the antidote. -Kato</p>

          <p> But we have no fear. We know we can make the antidote, and restore ourselves. -Kato</p>
