          <p>Deep in the southern forests of Inggison lives an ancient Elim named Taloc. The Elim is distrustful of most creatures, and though we of the Reian Tribe were aware of Taloc's existence for centuries, it wasn't until recent times that we made contact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we first approached the Elim, Taloc was apprehensive, but in time we learned to trust each other. Taloc knew us to be far different creatures than the infernal Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the time since, Taloc has proven to be an invaluable ally, and it is for that reason the Reian Tribe placed its fate on the boughs of the Elim of Light.</p>

          <p>When I was just a lad, I, Stephano of the Reian Tribe, discovered that I could communicate with animals and plants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The elders doubted me--after all, children are prone to allowing their imaginations run wild. But when I remained resolute in my belief, I was ridiculed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, I hid my abilities, and often spent hours alone in the wilderness of Balaurea communicating with the native creatures. Though I could speak in their tongue, I often found listening to their conversations more interesting.</p>

          <p>It was during one of these conversations that I heard the name of Taloc spoken for the first time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Let's ask Taloc for help," buzzed a Sparkie.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Taloc follows the will of Aion," replied a Dionae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was perplexed. What manner of creature in Balaurea would follow the will of Aion? I thought to speak to the creatures, but before I could, they had disappeared back into the wilderness.</p>

          <p>Over the next several months, I gathered all the information I could on Taloc by listening to the creatures of Balaurea. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I soon discovered that Taloc was an ancient Elim that resided in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the native beasts, Taloc was revered as some kind of god. He was the patron saint of nature, and represented hope and wisdom in the otherwise bleak landscape of Balaurea.</p>

          <p>I believed in Taloc from the beginning, but I could not convince the others of the Reian Tribe no matter what I tried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The elders thought I had gone mad, or that I was back to spreading lies about speaking with beasts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was still a youth at this point, and though I knew the danger would be great, I left the others of the Reian tribe, and set out to find Taloc.</p>

          <p>I nearly died on the journey--I had never roamed far from the Reian camp, and I discovered Balaurea to be a far harsher place than I ever imagined. Even the most fearsome beasts had to scrape and scratch to survive, and the Balaur lurked around every corner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I also discovered breathtaking beauty in pockets hidden throughout Balaurea. The world must have looked far different before it was sapped by Drana.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Starved, parched, and scarred from head to toe, at last I reached the domain of the Elim of Light.</p>

          <p>When we first met, the great Elim was cautious. He spoke in riddles, and it was clear that distrust existed between us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In a world filled with brainwashed disciples of the Balaur, I couldn't blame him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But over time, I earned Taloc's trust, and he allowed me to rest beneath his boughs.</p>

          <p>Once Taloc realized I was not sent by the Balaur, he told me his story.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In an age long past, Taloc was a simple Elim who had planted his roots at the heart of Inggison. During the Cataclysm, an enormous fragment of the Tower of Eternity struck Taloc, and lodged itself in his bark.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fragment gave him immense power, and a voice resonated deep within his wood--the will of Aion. It was then Taloc transcended from a simple Elim into a conduit of Aion's will.</p>

          <p>It was Aion's will that the Aether be safeguarded from the Balaur, and Taloc followed Aion's wishes vehemently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taloc's roots and branches stretched, and he called out to the Aether in Balaurea, and drew it in to the safety of his hollow. Taloc was careful to remain unnoticed by the Balaur, who were still reeling from the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Over time, the Elim grew to an enormous size, and remained ever faithful to Aion.</p>

          <p>After hearing Taloc's story, I exhaled a deep breath.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was comforting to know that even in the home of the treacherous Balaur, the will of Aion was still present.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at the same time, it was saddening to know that all Aion could do now was protect creation.</p>

          <p>I spent months at Taloc's side, and when I returned to the Reian Tribe, I told them what I had discovered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Doubt washed over their faces as I related Taloc's tale, but as most had believed me dead or taken by the Balaur, my claim warranted at least a search expedition to Taloc's realm, and of course, there the doubters found the ancient Elim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We found shelter beneath Taloc's boughs, and the ancient Elim used the Aether to help us survive in the callous landscape of Balaurea. But Taloc could not provide all of us with sustenance forever.</p>

          <p>In the end, it was decided that the elders and the children would be left with Taloc, and those of us capable of defending ourselves were dispersed to the farthest corners of Balaurea to spread the will of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The tale for me ends here, as another begins. Tomorrow I depart with comrades in arms, a warrior of the Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The future is uncertain, as are all things in Balaurea. I only pray that Taloc's powers remain strong, and that the Balaur do not find him.</p>
