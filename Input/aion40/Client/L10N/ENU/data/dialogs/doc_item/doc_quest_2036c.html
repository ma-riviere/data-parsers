          <p>I think I've made a grave mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we crossed the Rift, we weren't thinking ahead. We were so elated, showing off the valiance of the Bloody Mist Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we discovered treasure within the Fire Temple, we whooped with joy, oblivious to what lay ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My last day of happiness? Am I a prisoner now?</p>

          <p>I was right. Kromede has bound me here. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I see her, my breath catches in my throat. She's so beautiful! She belongs to some other, better world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that I know how powerful she is, how pitiless, I'm scared to death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why did she imprison me here? I can't even begin to guess.</p>

          <p>Kromede is like a second sun in this desolate underworld.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often think of Elysea and Agairon Village, and Hannet. But my memories seem...dull, unappealing. Love wouldn't fade so fast. Not true love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No. Even if I am imprisoned in Asmodae, in the Fire Temple, forever...I will be happy if I can just be with Kromede.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder whether she loves me as I love her...</p>

          <p>Kromede led me to a room brimming with treasure and ordered me to guard it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She cast spells on me. To protect me, she says, but...I feel heavy, now. Leaden. And whenever she looked at me...I felt no mirth in her laughing gaze.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't care! I just want to be near her. To be apart is agony! This place is good. It's home.</p>

          <p>I've started hearing things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first I thought that the Guardian Statues were crying, but I've watched them all day and they've not moved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I listen very closely, I can hear someone begging. "Please help me!" Over and over. Over and over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must be going mad!</p>

          <p>I've spoken to Agnita, who is bound into the Sacred Chalice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's told me stories of Kromede's cruelty. Oh, I am terrified now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time she comes to me, my blood runs icy cold. If I anger her, she do away with me as she did to Agnita.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How could I have loved such a heartless, pitiless, soulless monster?</p>

          <p>Agnita asked me if I wanted to escape, go back home....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Kromede seduced me, thoughts of home were...difficult. But since she bound me to the treasure room, I often reflect on Elysea and Hannet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now... Agnita would be alone in darkness if I left. I cannot leave her now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Kromede's will is vastly stronger than my own...</p>
