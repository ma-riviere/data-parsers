          <p>Day 1 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today is my first as warden of Rentus Base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is an honor, to be sure, but I almost refused, given recent events.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if my appointment was at all due to pity? But I must dismiss such unworthy thoughts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will do my best to live up to the expectations placed on me.</p>

          <p>Day 33 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have been quite busy of late. Plans to fortify our position are proceeding ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Already two new structures are complete, and the smiths report that weapons and armor have been finished.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My work load increases daily, but I do not mind. It makes me feel useful, and it helps me forget.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, tomorrow we begin construction on the expansion of the Residential Zone.</p>

          <p>Day 40 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was a terrible accident today. An unstable explosive detonated, and only Raynon's selfless sacrifice prevented an even bigger catastrophe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could not help but think of Kerran. He saved many lives the day he died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was it worth it? Many of those he saved only went on to die in later battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How many more of us need to die? How many more spouses and children have to leave behind grieving families?</p>

          <p>Day 48 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since the terrible accident, thoughts of my Kerran and Alanna come to me daily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wrote a letter to Nillis, but I never sent it. No need to burden him with my brooding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see the casualty reports. So many lives cut short.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We fight for our freedom, but will there be any of us left to enjoy it?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I am still trying to come to terms with the news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The notification came early this morning, and I still hold the letter in my hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(The text ends here, the parchment underneath torn jaggedly.)</p>
