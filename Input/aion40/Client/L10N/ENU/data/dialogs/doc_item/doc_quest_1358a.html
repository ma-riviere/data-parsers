          <p>Mystic Spring Management: Day 1</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mystic Spring is filling up little by little.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a slow but consistent trickle, and we predict that the Spring will be filled in approximately ten days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The water is clear and pure.</p>

          <p>The spring filled completely, then the level dropped a little. We are investigating the cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although clear, the spring water smells slightly like sulfur. That's something else we have to look into.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The water level of the Mystic Spring has returned to normal, and the sulfuric odor is no longer present.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A pilgrim on the Great Pilgrimage arrived, and asked to take a rest near the Mystic Spring.</p>

          <p>Water Condition: No abnormality in color or smell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note: The pilgrim is still camping near the Mystic Spring. However, he looked around the temple the first day he arrived, and has been fixating on the Mystic Spring ever since. There's something fishy about him.</p>
