          <p>Dear Meininerk,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your business seems to be booming!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But poor Oconerk can't even find any ore, nyerk. Bad times for Oconerk and wife.</p>

          <p>This brings Oconerk to his point. Everinrinerk keeps nagging for something shiny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you could send her something shiny...for the favor you owe Oconerk. Something very pretty and shiny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everinrinerk is very picky...more picky the older Shugo wife gets. But Everinrinerk is my blossom of love.</p>

          <p>Your debt to Oconerk will be gone if you send something very pretty and shiny and big to wife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is fair deal, Meininerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
