          <p>I am Savinus, a Reian tribesman. It was many, many years ago, before the great fall of the night curtain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were Atreians just like you, and we worshipped Siel as you do. Siel loved us very much and bestowed upon us the name "The People of Siel's Spear."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lady of Time told us to infiltrate Balaurea and clear the land of its savages, but the Cataclysm happened during the war...tore the world into two halves.</p>

          <p>It was many generations ago. Those Reians that survived the Cataclysm were stuck in Balaurea. Our fathers settled in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have endured this land for a long, long time. And I believe this is how the misunderstanding came about. We are not one with the Balaur--we simply share the same land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope your people will come to know this about us.</p>
