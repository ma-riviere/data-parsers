          <p>Dearest Medea,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your absence grows a jagged void in my chest. Every night I pray you shall return safely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You risk much to help your people, and it fills me with pride to think of your resolve.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my love for you hurts me. I am wounded and broken, a cracked and hollow shell without your smile to fuel me.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Everything in me clamors to know your touch again. I beg of you, return to me--let my heart rest for a time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if your mission was a matter of life or death for all Elysea, I would sacrifice the entire world to feel your lips once more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return, return and you shall be mine and I, yours, forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
