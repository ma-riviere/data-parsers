          <p>Theia's Story </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion was commanded by Brigade General Virkel in the name of Lady Triniel. Most of her generals were Assassins and Rangers, but Virkel was a Templar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Three arrogant brothers, Sirh, Barche, and Bert, served in the Red Sky. They often irritated the General with their bickering, as all three wanted to win the affections of the unit's Cleric, Angeiya.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the Legion showed excellent unity and organization. They drilled constantly, and in combat they moved in perfect unison, always with the fearless Virkel in the lead.</p>
