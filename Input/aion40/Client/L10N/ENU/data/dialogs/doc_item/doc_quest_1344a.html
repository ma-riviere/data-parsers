          <p>The Dartas Village has been swallowed entirely by the desert, and is now nearly buried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All residents have evacuated and we are escorting the refugees to safety.</p>

          <p>4. Ksellid Attacks</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ksellids, which have never been known to threaten Humans, have become hostile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Investigation suggests they may have accidentally harmed Humans while trying to capture Speedy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We eliminated Speedy, and ordered the locals to keep their distance from the Ksellids.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the Mystic Springs are drying up, though the Daevas of Life do their best to take care of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may be difficult to stop the desertification of the Eltnen region unless the Mystic Springs return to normal.</p>
