          <p>A Human named Hierni was kidnapped at the Outpost Ruins by Kaidan Krall. This is the first time the Krall have kidnapped a Human, and we'd better make sure it's the last time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All Guardians are ordered to keep the Krall from approaching the Fortress.</p>

          <p>It is suspected that the Krall took Hierni to the Kaidan Mine. Therefore, all Guardians are required to keep strict watch on the paths to the mine. </p>

          <p>In addition, anyone seeing suspicious Krall activity is required to report it to the headquarters immediately.</p>
