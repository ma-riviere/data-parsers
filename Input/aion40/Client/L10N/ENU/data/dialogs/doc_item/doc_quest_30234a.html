          <p>Long ago, a Daeva lived whose valor was matched by none. His name was Taros, and bravery was in his blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even as a child, the villagers knew he would become a Daeva. The celebrated story created when he was but a child assured him of his ascension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to tell the tale of Taros the Daeva is to tell the tale of Taros the boy. One day long ago, his childhood friends went to collect herbs. But playing like boys do, they forget all about their chores.</p>

          <p>A fierce and wild Tog suddenly jumped out from the grass. Fearing for their lives, the children fled down the hill. But there, an even greater threat waited for them--a Krall that had somehow penetrated the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The children froze in fear, and their tender and terrified legs petrified beneath them. The Krall let out a deafening roar and swung his sword over his head, his attack imminent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At just that moment of peril, Taros shook off his fear and shouted to his friends, "Run back up the hill while I hold the monster back!"</p>

          <p>Taros hurled his basket of herbs to the ground and began throwing rocks and stones at the Krall. Once his friends were safely up the hill, Taros himself ran up to join them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to Taros's bravery, all of his friends were still alive. Seeing the frightened and bruised children in the village, the elders asked them what had happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each of the children stuttered through their stories, but the end was always the same--Taros had saved them all.</p>

          <p>The village priest summoned Taros to the temple, and he very softly said, "Your friends are alive today thanks to you, young boy."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then he looked deep into the boy's eyes and added, "But if you ever see a Krall again, you run! You run as fast as you can!" And he patted him on the head.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Taros's mother didn't give him such a warm reception. For putting his life at risk, she scolded him until tears ran down his cherried cheeks.</p>

          <p>Taros had always been a quiet boy. But whenever danger struck, his courage knew no bounds. He would always put himself in harm's way to protect anyone in his village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Understandably, Taros's mother was never fond of his valor. And the thought of him ascending as a Daeva didn't comfort her, either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better than anyone else, she knew the perilous tasks a Daeva faced daily. And she offered prayers to Aion, asking for Taros to live out his years peacefully as a Human, not a Daeva.</p>

          <p>However, Aion had a different fate in store for Taros. As a gallant youth, Taros soon ascended and entered the temple for training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He neither stood out in physique nor in the mastery of magic--he was just an average young man. But friends and teachers alike started to take notice once his skills quickly progressed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter how arduous the training or situation, Taros never gave up and never backed down. Upon his graduation, great things were expected of the new Daeva, and glorious victories he was to have.</p>

          <p>As predicted, Taros's sword left a trail of dead Balaur in its wake. Any troop fortunate enough to have the young soldier as a member went undefeated in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He soon rose among the ranks, and the very whisper of his name struck fear in the hearts of foes. Siel recognized the young Daeva's skills and quickly appointed him General of the Special Missions Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Under Siel's orders, Taros then valiantly led his legion to Tiamat's realm.</p>

          <p>Taros commanded his Legionaries carefully and courageously through Balaurea. The lack of Aether made the journey difficult, but the legion powered through.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then disaster struck. Tiamat, the Dragon Lord himself, appeared before them in a gust of smoke. Taros's legion tried quickly to form a battle line, but Tiamat didn't give them the chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur Lord let out a huge breath, immediately turning all of the Legionaries into stone. But within the field of statues stood Taros still of flesh.</p>

          <p>Deep in the depth of both shock and despair, Taros could hear Tiamat speak, "Are you the one they call Taros? I have heard much from my underlings about you. This is why I spared you for now."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taros was terrified but, taming his fears, he looked up into the eyes of the Dragon Lord as Tiamat continued to speak. "I cannot let you harry my troops anymore. But I don't intend to kill you, either. That would be a great waste to kill a strong warrior such as yourself."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"I offer you a bargain. Should you do what I ask of you, I shall release your Legionaries. But heed this, Taros--here is no release from the covenant you are about to make with me. To free your men, you must be bound here for eternity."</p>

          <p>There was no choice for Taros. He found no honor in being enslaved for eternity, but he would not condemn his soldiers to a stony grave for the rest of time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So Taros accepted Tiamat's offer. The Dragon Lord muttered the words that returned the flesh to his Legionaries, but also confined their leader to the chains of a curse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Taros's legion breathed the breath of life once again, both Taros and Tiamat were gone. No one ever saw Taros since that fateful day. Only the legend of his bravery remained.</p>
