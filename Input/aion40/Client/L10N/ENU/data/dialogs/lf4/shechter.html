          <p>Does Daeva need reliable weapons or armor, nyerk nyerk?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugo knows Daevas are struggling with high prices during these days. That's why Tigraki Studio has developed new special weapons and armor for Daevas like you, nyerk nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugo calls them now-now weapons. Good for now-now, but Daeva will need something else for the long run. Good price, Daeva. Good price.</p>
