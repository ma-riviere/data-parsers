          <p>Greetings, Daeva. This is a very dangerous place...even for a Soul Healer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have witnessed the poor state of many Daevas that have come before me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where were you fighting, [%username]? You look...terrible. I believe your soul needs healing.</p>
