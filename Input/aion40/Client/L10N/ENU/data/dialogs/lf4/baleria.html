          <p>Greetings. Shopping for weapons and armor, are we?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, if you're an Assassin or a Ranger, let's start seeing some coins trading hands! My items are the top of the line in Sanctum-certified weaponry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unlike that tripe that Asprenas and Laodice sell--Shugos wouldn't touch it! So, what can I get for you? How much are you looking to spend?</p>

          <p>I can't do anything for you, Daeva. I suggest you come back when there's a reason for you to come back.</p>
