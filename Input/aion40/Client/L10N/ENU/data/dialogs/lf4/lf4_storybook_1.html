          <p>- An Introduction to the Vaphutanar -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the era known as the Age of Dawn, Aion created countless creatures which roamed freely across Atreia. This was before the Balaur arrived and eventually wiped out over 90% of these organisms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One particular creature, the mysterious Vaphutanar, is rumored to have existed during this Age of Dawn, yet little documentation or proof can be found to support this story.</p>

          <p>This report is an archaeological investigation of that forgotten creature, the Vaphutanar, as well as an historical examination aimed at proving its existence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Etymology of the name "Vaphutanar" -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ancient Atreian language relies heavily on interpretation. Therefore, determining the translation of "Vaphutanar" required much deduction and assumption. However, I believe an interpretation has been established.</p>

          <p>The root word "Vaphuta" is believed to mean "great." While "Nar" is a designation for "divine beings" or, more likely in this case, "wings."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Therefore, Vaphutanar translates to "Great Wings." Supporting evidence of this conclusion shall be discussed in the following section.</p>

          <p>- Morphology of "Vaphutanar" -</p>

          <p>A Poetan legend says the Vaphutanar had a sleek body that resembled the Gryphu and flamboyant feathers on the head like the Pluma.</p>

          <p>Its wingspan is rumored to be wide enough to block the sun and powerful enough to cause a storm with one single flap. With these considerations, interpretation of "Vaphutanar" as meaning "Great Wings" seems accurate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there is still much doubt in many academic circles, with most claiming the Vaphutanar to be nothing more than the grandiose imaginatings of the ancient people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the magnificent appearance of Taloon, the king of Gryphu who inhabits the land near the Zumion Ruins, does suggest otherwise.</p>

          <p>Primitive Human and Sapien histories show that many tribes celebrated rites of passage, usually involving the display of one's courage or strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A recently discovered Kishar Krall mural hints at a unique Balaur rite of passage which depicts warriors surrounding a giant bird-like monster with Krall behind them in support.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Vaphutanar was indeed a giant beast as the legend suggests, there would not have been a more tempting prey to the Drakan.</p>

          <p>- In Conclusion -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have scoured the whole of Elysea--from Poeta to Heiron--looking for hard evidence to its existence, but found very little.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Risking my own life to find proof, I traveled through the Abyss Gate and searched the barren Asmodian lands to no avail. The only remaining hope I have for finding real evidence is in the land of the Balaur.</p>

          <p>The odds are likely that a complete account of the Vaphutanar lies not with the Elyos or even the Asmodians--but with the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Research of the legendary Vaphutanar must continue there, in Balaurea. But how?</p>
