          <p>I am at my wit's end with these..."Daevas"! They're all complacent fools living in a shallow pond of false security!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I keep telling them to prepare for another attack by the Balaur, and they look down upon me as if I were begging them for Kinah. Complacent fools!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing scares a researcher more than being left vulnerable like this. The ignorance of Elyos may be bliss, but a Balaur sword stays as sharp as ever!</p>
