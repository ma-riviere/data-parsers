          <p>Ahhh, Balaurea! I can't believe I'm in such an exotic land. I thought I would be trapped forever inside the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, yes, I've never regretted becoming a Daeva, but I sometimes wish I would have traveled more before I ascended. I could have ventured to every corner of Inggison, discovered creatures that I now only read about in books.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at least I made it here to Balaurea. This will quell the hunger of my remorse for now.</p>
