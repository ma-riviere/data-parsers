          <p>What? You've thought of visiting Pilipides? Well now, Pilipides is a great Daeva and a personal friend of mine, but you won't get much use out of his stock. You'll soon find yourself with a broken weapon that you're ashamed to wield!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You just take your time and look around here. I'm sure you'll find plenty of good, solid, advanced weapons to your taste.</p>
