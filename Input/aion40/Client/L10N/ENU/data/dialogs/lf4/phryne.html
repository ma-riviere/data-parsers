          <p>Sorry for being so short with you earlier. I haven't been in the best mood lately. It's like my whole body's constricted. My stomach is bloated like I've eaten five boiled Aukwi eggs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I feel nauseous and cold-hot, and I can't think straight. Yesterday, I forget to answer the Brigade General right away, and she chewed me out.</p>

          <p>No, no! That's not it at all. It's being cooped up inside the fortress instead of getting out there and slashing away at the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My sword's gleaming finish has gone unblooded too long, and I feel so lethargic without the fight to energize me. I can barely get up in the mornings these days.</p>
