          <p>I'm in a foul mood, [%username]. The soldiers are incompetent, the garrison is in shambles, and Rocayd might the biggest imbecile in all of Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shards! The next Daeva who asks me where the nearest Obelisk is will find it...fast...real fast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have so much that needs to get done.... I can't imagine my brother Krizarid has to deal with this kind of rubbish in Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at least here enemies aren't in short supply.... I suppose I should be thankful that my prey often comes right to my blade.</p>
