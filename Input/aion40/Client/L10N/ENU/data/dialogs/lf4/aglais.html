          <p>You're a [%userclass], right? It's pretty obvious with you. You just have that look....</p>

          <p>I only ascended a short while ago...still wet under the wings, they say. I volunteered to come here to study the Balaur, though everyone tried to talk me out of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it was my combat experience that got me the job. But now, it's like I have to walk on eggshells around my fellow researchers.</p>

          <p>It's Philon. I know he's quite the renowned researcher in Sanctum, but all I do is clean up after him. I feel like his wife!</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I am a very skilled researcher! I have my own techniques...new techniques! But the old ways are the only ways for Philon.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not right for Sanctum or Philon to ignore a capable mind like mine. I just want to prove myself, you know?</p>
