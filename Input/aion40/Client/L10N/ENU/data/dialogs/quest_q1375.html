        <p>Entire villages are disappearing into the wasteland caused by the desertification of Eltnen. We must do what we can to protect them.</p>

          <p>Oh, that's not all! The Centurion pushes us to the limit. First he has me feeding the villagers and now he wants me to arm them with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1375a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He told me that the thorns are for the Watch's spearheads and arrowheads, which would be a good thing--if the Watch had any training. I knew this place was trouble the minute I set eyes on it.</p>
