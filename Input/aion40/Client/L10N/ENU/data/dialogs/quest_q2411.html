          <p>The view from the Observatory is spectacular, don't you think?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ruins, the sparkling lake, the Nepra trees shrouded by fog. The beauty of it moves me to poetry! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans are reluctant to travel here because of the Nepra tree mist. Some think it creepy, but it's so lyrical! Shall I recite some of my verse?</p>

          <p>Humans are right to be cautious. There are spirits in these lands, and their numbers are increasing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now they've pushed out to the edge of Fall Road where they attack travelers.</p>

          <p>Simply put, there are too few of us and too many of them. </p>

          <p>If it was just water and earth spirits, we could control their numbers. They've spawned others, though. Now there are soil spirits, terra spirits, lake spirits and mist spirits!</p>
