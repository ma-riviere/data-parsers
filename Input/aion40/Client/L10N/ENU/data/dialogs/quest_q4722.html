          <p>Any dredgion, much less one as important as the Chantra Dredgion, is a tough nut to crack. Just emptying its halls of its crew isn't nearly enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I expect you'd know this, [%username]. So do the higher-ups at Pandaemonium. That's why they've been experimenting with Drana drawn from Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've come up with...well, something that I'd hoped you would try out.</p>

          <p>It's called a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3722a]. And if it does what it's supposed to...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, I'm sorry, I can't tell you what it's supposed to do, so you don't become biased. Only that it should affect the Balaur on the Chantra Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need someone to go there with the Emitter and give it a field test. And I need a volunteer....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Here--use the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3722a] anywhere aboard the Chantra Dredgion. Make sure to note what effect it has on the Balaur, if any.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know much about crafting this kind of thing, but from what I've been told, it should work...I hope....</p>

          <p>What? You know, without a field test this thing will never be approved for wider use. And we could use a potentially powerful weapon against the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, testing it could be dangerous, but so is being aboard a Dredgion in the first place. Why not take the extra step?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fine. I'll accept your refusal. Just don't expect me to like or forget it.</p>

          <p>The researchers are practically hopping up and down in anticipation and impatience. They're starting to bug me.</p>

          <p>Can't say I blame them, I suppose. Success here could make the war, not to mention their reputations.</p>

          <p>Ahhh, good! That sounds just like what they said it would do! I'll put in the report right away, so they can stop bothering me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now all they have to do is make it work in other, more general environments. Still, this is a huge step forward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There will be more field tests in the future, though. That's partly because you were brave enough to do the very first. Here's the payment I promised.</p>
