          <p>Hey, you're [%username]! I heard about you from Tellarius. He said you got rid of the Klaws in the desert. I was just trying to figure out how to address that problem here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everybody is preoccupied with the Balaur and Lepharist Revolutionaries, but I think we need to keep an eye on the Klaws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many people look down on them as insects, but really they're quite smart.</p>

          <p>They're dangerously smart. So smart that if we don't reduce their numbers pretty soon we may not need to worry about defending this area from the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've dealt with them before. I don't have to tell you how tricky they can be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we want to hold this camp, we've got to act now.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to know you're with us. I've pinpointed their nest at Heiron Pass, but they've spread all over the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wherever they are, they've got to be put down. Kill as many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutH1_38_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1_37_An]s as you can manage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>10 each seems like a good start.</p>

          <p>Are you sure you're the same [%username] who fought Klaws in Eltnen? Those things are a menace! A horrible plague on all our lands! Straight from the heart of darkness itself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They lay in wait for us to show weakness, to turn our attention from their insidious invasion, and then when we least expect it they'll STRIKE!</p>

          <p>Well done! I wish we had someone who could kill that many every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Killing 20 Klaws is only scratching the surface, but they're smart enough to know they're in danger so they'll lay low for a time.</p>
