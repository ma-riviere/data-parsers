          <p>You probably think it's absurd, [%username], but I have good reason to believe the completed test subject made by the Lepharists is in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I overheard the researchers talking. They said they're experimenting with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_PerfectWa_40_Ae] in Lake Asteria and Azoturan!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>RM-114c must be the test subject. We need to do something about this!</p>
