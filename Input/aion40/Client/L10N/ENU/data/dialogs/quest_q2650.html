          <p>Daeva, I'm not sure if you're aware of the highly regimented structure of the Balaur legions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though they look similar, each legion soldier has its own specialty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you study them carefully, you can see that they're use different weapons, styles, and armor.</p>

          <p>They also have assassins, equally skilled and as dangerous as our own.</p>

          <p>Head to Hoarfrost Outpost and kill Bakarma Legion assassins. You shouldn't have to look hard to find them.</p>
