          <p>Makes my eyes water just thinking of the smell. I tripped over a log and landed on one! The stuff of nightmares, I tell you! And now, I smell like year old socks!</p>

          <p>Tons of soap. Five hot showers. Sigh. I think I'm stuck with it till it wears off.</p>

          <p>Thank Ariel! I don't think I could bear confronting another [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Zombie_34_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Decayed Grove, take them down, and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3542A]s so I can destroy them. So no one else gets smelly like I did.</p>
