          <p>On my last scouting trip to Theobomos Lab, I was ambushed by a spirit called an Unstable Triroan. It almost killed me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I escaped through the rift I realized that if I could pass through, the monsters might be able to also. What a disaster that would be for Baltasar Hill Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to go into the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_D_LF2a_entrance] and terminate [%dic:STR_DIC_E_D_LF2a_Q4117] before it realizes it can follow me here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Report it to Surt when you're done, and he'll reward you appropriately.</p>

          <p>The Theobomos Lab is starting to give me a headache.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium wants a report on how the rift was created, and what preemptive measures we're taking to secure the surrounding area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't even know where to start right now.</p>

          <p>That's quite impressive!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe if I start out by listing the threats we've already dealt with, the rest will go easier. I might actually be able to finish this report today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your trouble. Pandaemonium has provided me with some coins to reward Daevas who assist me. I will also include your name in this report.</p>

          <p>Parqusha saw a horrific monster while scouting, and was worried about what could happen if such a creature came through the rift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You entered Theobomos Lab, killed the Unstable Triroan, and reported to Surt. He thanked you for removing a major threat.</p>
