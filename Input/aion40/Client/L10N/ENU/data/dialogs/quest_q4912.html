          <p>Well...remember when I told you I'd discovered a way to remove the curse? I have, but it's tricky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DC1_DrakeVioletNamedQ_47_Ae] is a particularly malicious Drake, and even the Balaur found it hard to control, so they sealed it in an Artifact in Draupnir. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I know how to use it to cancel out the curse on Agrif's Rage.</p>

          <p>Beritra's Oracle in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_H] is where you'll find the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDF3Dragon_FOBJ_Q4912] with Garnokk sealed inside. I'll give you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_4912a] that can break the seal. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vanquish [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DC1_DrakeVioletNamedQ_47_Ae] and bring me his Blackened Spirit. When we imbue Agrif's Rage with that spirit, it will cancel out the sword's curse.</p>

          <p>The Draupnir Cave is fraught with danger, so take some reliable allies with you.</p>
