          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I have another order to fill for the Manastone Removers Association.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have a big Kinah deal with some questionable Daevas on the outskirts of town. They requested a bulk order of the MP +40, Evasion +8, and Parry +16 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They want 10 apiece, so 30 total. I guess they're planning on starting a war somewhere. Can you locate them for me? I've got a bundle of other manastones for you as a reward.</p>
