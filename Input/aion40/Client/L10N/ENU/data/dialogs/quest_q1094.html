          <p>So if Theobomos didn't create it...who did? I suppose we'll never know now if it's all destroyed.</p>

          <p>Sanctum will be disappointed to hear that Project Drakanhammer is long gone. If only Theobomos hadn't activated it prematurely, perhaps we'd have won the war by now.</p>

          <p>I'll put this all in the report to Fasimedes. As to your reward, take these. They're some of the results of my research.</p>

          <p>Atropos was convinced that Theobomos had a secret laboratory somewhere in the area. She sent you out to Port Anangke to find a book that may have held some clues.</p>

          <p>The book led you to the laboratory, as she thought. In the library there you discovered that Project Drakanhammer was immensely powerful, but now destroyed.</p>
