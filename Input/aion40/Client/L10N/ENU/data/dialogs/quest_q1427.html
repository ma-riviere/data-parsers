          <p>I have received orders, [%username]. Orders which must be carried out even though I am loath to do so. This world has spilled its lifeblood, Aether, which turns the natural into something quite unnatural.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I should have volunteered for Sanctum. Perhaps I should have devoted my life to the Five, but Atreia turns, and I must turn with it...</p>

          <p>It's the Manduri forest. There are two problems I have been asked to address there. The first is a simple overpopulation of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Vespa_21_n]s, but the second....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at the ground, [%username]. Look at the rocks and soil--inanimate. Enter the Forest, though--the Aether has drawn some of these inanimate things together. The Aether has given them LIFE.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call them [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_21_An]s, and while we could grant them freedom and leave them alone, their rampaging ways threaten the safety of travelling Humans. They have to be destroyed. Would you help me?</p>
