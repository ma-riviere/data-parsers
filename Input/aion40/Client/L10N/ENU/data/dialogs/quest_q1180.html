          <p>At last! Daeva, you're here at the right time. I need a favor.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have something that needs to be delivered to the Miraju's Holy Ground. I can't trust it to just anyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it wasn't for Stony here, I'd go myself. He has a tendency to become excited when I'm gone. And by excited, I mean dangerously violent.</p>

          <p>It's an offering to the Ardus Shrine. The temple has been sending someone to collect my tribute every month, but no one has come this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if they've forgotten about me. They've got enough to keep them busy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you deliver the offering for me, Daeva?</p>

          <p>I shouldn't be too hard on you, I know. You Daevas have many important tasks to carry out. Sanctum never sleeps.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's just frustrating. I suppose I'll have to send it using the Shugo Express Mail Service. Hardly befitting of a divine tribute.</p>

          <p>We've been inundated with people arriving on the Great Pilgrimage. Vascus must have been terribly worried to have sent you.</p>
