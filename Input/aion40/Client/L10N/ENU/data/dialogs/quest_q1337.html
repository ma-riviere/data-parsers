          <p>You must help me, or rather, my friend in Theobomos. He asked me to send him some basic items from here, but the package is too big, so the Zephyr Express Mail said they can't do it.</p>

          <p>By Ariel's light, I knew you would help. Deliver it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Crios] in the tent of the Meniherk Excavation Union. </p>

          <p>Even if I take a quick trip to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_Path_LF2A] through the teleport system, this area would be understrength, so you are really helping us out!</p>
