          <p>I probably don't have to tell you how many different kinds of creatures live in the Abyss. Most of them have been here since the Cataclysm, or so say the scholars anyhow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And most of them have adapted to the conditions here, too, and don't look much like their Atreian counterparts.</p>

          <p>Klaw. They're exactly the same here as in Elysea--meaner than Asmodian roaches!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>And you might think to look at them they're nothing much more than big bugs, but you'd be wrong. They're smart. And tough. And they breed like...well, like bugs. So we really need to thin them out, and soon.</p>

          <p>I asked a Klaw expert in Heiron how we could keep them from multiplying so fast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said, "Kill as many as you can." Helpful, eh? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So that's exactly what I'd like you to do--go to Bloodburn Reach and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_NeutL1_40_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_NeutH1_40_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_NeutL1_39_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_NeutH1_39_An]s.</p>
