          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first job involves the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA131]s. One of the farmers here, Ager, has lost his farm to them already, and now they've moved into the nearby fields.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we don't act fast, Poeta risks losing the majority of this season's harvest.</p>

         <p>Exactly.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>My more experienced soldiers have already left to take care of problems out by Cliona Lake. So what I need you to do, [%username], is hunt some [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA131]s for me.</p> 
         <p> </p>   
         <p>They shouldn't be too hard to put down. They're weakest of their tribe, and end up running away about as frequently as most Asmodians.</p>
