          <p>Shards! The one day, the ONE day I miss a committee meeting, and BAM! I've "volunteered" to run Daeva's Day events!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't hate Daeva's Day. I'd just rather be running things behind the scenes, or even, you know, celebrating it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I'd better do a good job, or else I'll be "volunteered" again next year. So, would you like to participate in an event?</p>

          <p>It's a scavenger hunt...of sorts. Except there's a little less searching and a little more battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look like you've seen a little combat, so it should be pretty simple for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you get a prize: a Heart Headband. Why not participate?</p>

          <p>All you have to do to get your prize is trade in 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80003a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find them attached to [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Cherubim2Wp_24_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Skeleton_24_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DIC_M_DigCherubimL_24_n]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I take back my complaint earlier; at least I didn't "volunteer" to do THAT job. Good luck!</p>
