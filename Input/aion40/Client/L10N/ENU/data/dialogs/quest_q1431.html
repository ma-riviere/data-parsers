          <p>What happened? Oh, I was terrible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried several jobs when I came back. After a while, I finally realized that fishing is what I'm really good at--and what I really enjoy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was able to make a living at it for a while, but lately it's become impossible.</p>

          <p>The number of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_n_c_10c]s in the river has increased far too quickly. They eat the other fish and have few natural predators to keep their numbers reasonable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I catch them whenever I have the chance, but I can't solve the problem alone. Are you available to help?</p>
