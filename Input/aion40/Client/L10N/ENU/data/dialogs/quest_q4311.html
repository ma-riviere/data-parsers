          <p>By Zikel, it's so hot!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Utgar told me to make a fire to cook the meat on skewers. I said we should just hold it over the lava! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure he's older than me, but...a fire? It wouldn't be so bad if I had my necklace!</p>

          <p>Before I came here, I asked Utsida to make me a Snowflake Necklace. It's kept me from going mad from the heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But on my way back from the Sky Temple of Arkanis a couple of days ago, I realized it wasn't working. I think it was broken when I fought Sawteeth Lehul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Utgar won't let me go look for the pieces that broke off. Could you find them for me, [%username]? I'll give you a reward. </p>

          <p>I realized the necklace was broken just before I left the Sky Temple of Arkanis, so the pieces must be somewhere inside. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The monsters in the temple may have swallowed them by now. There were [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DrakeAgDGuard_30_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShadowstalkerreWiGuard_30_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SouledstoneDReGuard_31_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalFire3D_31_An]s in there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The parts I lost are the Snow Crystal Pendant, the Ice Bead, the Frost Bead, and the Platinum Clasp. Thanks!</p>

          <p>In the sky temple, you searched the monsters who may have swallowed the necklace parts and found the Snow Crystal Pendant, Ice Bead, Frost Bead, and Platinum Clasp. When you returned with them, Embla was delighted to be able to fix her necklace.</p>
