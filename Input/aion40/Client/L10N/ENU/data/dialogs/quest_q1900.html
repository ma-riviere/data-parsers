          <p>Countless men and women walk into this Lyceum as Humans and leave as Daevas, but none has shone with such...such fire!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to take this ring I made. If you look closely you'll see five gems representing the Seraphim Lords. Look, here is Ariel, then Yustiel, Kaisinel, Vaizel, and Nezekan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, you can leave this ring as it is or you can have it imbued. Imbued, the ring will sharpen your senses and aid you in your journey through life. Would you like to have it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I want you to seek out Five Daevas who have committed their studies to just one specific aspect of the Aether all around us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mikero] the bard, then [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bellasia], the Daeva of Water. After seeing Bellasia, you'll need to speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_LA203], the Melancholy Daeva, then [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Demodocos], the Daeva of Fortune-telling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When those four have all imbued your ring with Aether, you'll need to see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vatonia], who will seal the Aether within the ring and leave it enchanted forever.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>That ring there, it's a Perikles design, is it not? He has much to learn of his craft, but I would be remiss not to enhance it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will weave the Aether into this ring with my words. I have learned all there is to learn about our language--my poems blend breath with Aether, my blessings bring benediction and deliverance to those lucky enough to receive them. My spoken word, [%username], is your salvation.</p>

          <p>Aether and water--the two aren't as different as you might think, [%username]. Water may not empower a Daeva as Aether does, but it is the lifeblood of all creatures in this world, just as Aether is the lifeblood of our planet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you look closely enough, you may begin to notice the natural flow of Aether. It moves as water does, but the routes it takes are guided by invisible banks.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Allow me to imbue the ring with my own blessing. A drop of water from this fountain...yes...and it is done. The elements are powerful tools, as any Spiritmaster will tell you, and now you have one protecting your soul.</p>

          <p>Nearby is the Artisan's Hall--a place of skilled tradesmen and women, a keyhole to the heart of the city. I believe [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alcmene] is waiting there for you.</p>

          <p>You cannot see it, but the Aether in it is incredibly powerful. It flashes like forked lightning. Now it needs sealing, before the Aether escapes and the ring reverts to its original form. Quickly, visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vatonia] in the Library of the Sages. Go!</p>
