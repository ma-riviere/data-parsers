          <p>This is ridiculous. My pool of soldiers is shrinking, and our mission here keeps expanding!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we found the Lepharist Bastion, I put them under surveillance. But our Sentinel never reported in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lemia and I went out to find him nearly dead, hiding in the Kuriullu Mountain foothills.</p>

          <p>Yeah! Hours later, he'd have died. En route to the Fortress, he told me he was ambushed by a flock of Viragos.</p>

          <p>He said there was nowhere to watch the Bastion without stumbling into Virago roosts.</p>
