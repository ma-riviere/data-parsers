          <p>Hmm...they could be using the power of Drana Crystals to compress wandering souls into Stigma stones. I suppose that's possible to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that's true, we have to stop them and keep this knowledge from spreading. There are other unscrupulous forces in the world who wouldn't hesitate to use such unsavory methods.</p>

She had you seek advice from Maloren on how to stop them, and he sent you into Dark Poeta to deal with the Shulacks' chief scientist and cut off their supply of Drana. When you returned to Miriya, she fitted you with another Stigma slot.</p>
