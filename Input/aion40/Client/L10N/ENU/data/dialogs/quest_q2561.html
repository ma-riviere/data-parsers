          <p>It's been almost half a year since I came here, but we've made almost no progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we were on schedule, the preliminary survey would be complete by now. We'd be starting the restoration work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid at this rate we'll never be able to revive Kurngalfberg.</p>

          <p>Well, the Worg population has been neglected for far too long. But that's the least of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The real challenge is the ghosts. People who were buried along with Kurngalfberg now wander the city. They don't seem to know they're dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The natives were naturally wary of outsiders, and now their ghosts attack us.</p>

          <p>We requested support from Beluslan Fortress, and they sent us two Archons. Two!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do understand. Given all the fighting, even two was generous. But it's not enough to deal with the ghosts, let alone to protect our outpost here.</p>

          <p>Great news, [%username]. We can use every Daeva we can get.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got three main concerns--the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkFiD_37_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkWiD_37_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkPrD_37_An]s have caused us the most trouble. They're our priority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They each fight in a different way, so you may want to strategize before you go down into the city.</p>
