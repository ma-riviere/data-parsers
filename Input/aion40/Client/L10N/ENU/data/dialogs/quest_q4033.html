          <p>Sometimes people forget that the Humans of Brusthonin fought against the Balaur. In some ways they were braver than we Daevas--they didn't have the benefit of immortality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had only recently ascended, and I found Humans to be excellent fellow soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One man in particular became a close friend of mine. He survived the battle that killed almost everyone else.</p>

          <p>His name was Portaro.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After fighting the Balaur, he deserved a happy life. They all did--get married, have children, grow old. It's why we protect Humanity, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the contamination ruined everything people had rebuilt here after the Cataclysm. I suppose Portaro was fortunate to die from it.</p>

          <p>Most who died from contamination became undead. There's no worse fate. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I could do for Portaro was bury him--and thankfully he didn't rise again. I think it's important for Daevas to understand Human contributions to our war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The flowers he liked best are blossoming again as Brusthonin recovers. Would you show your respect for Humanity by gathering some of them for me to lay on his grave?</p>

          <p>Portaro really liked [%dic:STR_DIC_DF2B_herb_d_n_c_40a] flowers. They stopped growing in Brusthonin after the contamination started, but lately I've spotted some here and there. Seeing them reminds me of old times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only we'd paid more attention...I wish I had been with Portaro at the end.</p>
          <p> </p>
