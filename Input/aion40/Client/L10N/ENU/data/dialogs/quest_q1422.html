          <p>I'm so eager to go to Sanctum! I count the seconds until I can get away, but every time I think I'm almost done around here, something else crops up.</p>

          <p>If this keeps up, I may never get it back!</p>

          <p>My sword! Oh, I discovered a very well-made sword, but I didn't like its shape. It didn't fit my hands and it was quite awkward to swing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last time I went to Sanctum, I left it with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Laokones] to have it reshaped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I found a sword that better fits me, and it's lovely besides. The trouble is that I can't get a break to go to Sanctum! Do you have time to help me?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It also fits my hands much better, far less awkward. I love it.</p>
