          <p>Calamot is an herb used mainly as a potion ingredient. You'd remember if you'd smelled it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its odor is rather...peculiar. In particular, dried [%dic:STR_DIC_G_herb_d_n_c_30c] is so strong that you can smell it clear across the village.</p>

          <p>That's Calamot. Most animals hate the smell. If I carry some around with me, I won't need to worry so much!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it grows only near Fall Road or the Mist Mane village. Both of those places are very dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it shouldn't be too hard for you to get it! How about it? Would you gather some [%dic:STR_DIC_G_herb_d_n_c_30c] for me? </p>
