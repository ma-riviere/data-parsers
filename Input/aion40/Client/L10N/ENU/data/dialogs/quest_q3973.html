          <p>In all honesty, my friend, there is little challenge in easy prey. Conquest of a Shulack is not the same as conquest of an Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The more Mesalina pulls away from me, the more I desire her. She is the sun to my moon, you understand? You know I can surely have any beautiful Daeva walking these streets, but I desire her.</p>

          <p>Why don't you believe me? My heart aches for Mesalina, and you stand there and mock my feelings!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ever since you returned from Inggison, I cannot get her out of my head. I think of her when I eat, and it taints my hunger. I think of her when I sleep, and I awaken in a sweat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Love has cursed me, and I only desire her more. I can have anyone I want, and yet my heart's eye only sees Mesalina. Is this what true love feels like, I wonder?</p>

          <p>You must think I'm quite the fool, [%username]. To be this handsome and still desire a woman who gives me such anguish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like you said, love is curious. But I know she loves me. She wouldn't have invited me to see her if she did not feel the way I feel. That is why I have one more favor to ask of you. I would go this time but...well, it is quite warm and I do not like to sweat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Utisda], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Daphnis] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Andu] and pick up some gifts I have ordered from them? Then deliver these gifts to my true love, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mesalina].</p>

          <p>I have asked everyone in Sanctum about her, and I have found out all I need to know to win her heart. Her favorite foods, her favorite color, why she chose to be a Cleric...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the most important thing I found out is that she loves to receive gifts. And from there my plan was born. If you do what I ask, Mesalina will be mine by nightfall.</p>

          <p>I have heard the rumors about Mesalina just like you have, and I don't believe them for one second! She is much too pure to sell her love for cold Kinah.</p>

          <p>Arieluma. Thersites said he was sending over his messenger of love, but I was not expecting someone like you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, I have what he asked for. My finest work to date. I made this necklace with the most exquisite diamonds in Elysea. And, as Thersites requested, I engraved "My Love, Forever" on the back.</p>

          <p>I almost didn't believe him when he said those words: "My Love, Forever."</p>

          <p>And not once has he ever bought any of them a gift. He's ordered gifts for himself, of course, but never for anyone else.</p>
