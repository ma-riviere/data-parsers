          <p>No, actually. I'm referring to a huge Krall creature called Mabangtah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, we were days into our desert crossing--our food and drink supplies had been consumed. We were exhausted; poor Ernia was too weak to stand, and we sat for a break...we were really just waiting to die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then young Teos saw them--a group of Krall approaching. He was terrified, as any boy would be, and ran to hide behind me. I was not afraid. A quick death at the hands of the Krall or a drawn out one from the elements...that choice was easy.</p>

          <p>They marched right up to us. Then the front ranks opened up, and up stepped [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Mabangta].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bowed my head, but no blow struck me. Instead, they just walked away. When I looked up, they had left behind containers full of food and water! We couldn't believe it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their donation saved our lives. If I could, I would love to thank them. Could you look for them for me, [%username]?</p>
