          <p>I've made my decision.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I get so tongue-tied just thinking about Sadena. How could I expect to sway her with words? No, a gift is what I need. But it must be the right gift. Remind me again what items Lidorasa recommended to you?</p>

          <p>Right! The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2921a] made by Ondanyerk or [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2921b] specially made by Lanse. I don't get it myself, but if that's what the ladies of Vanahal value...well, I'm going to need some more Kinah.</p>

          <p>That's one thing taken care of. I just need to decide between the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2921a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2921b]. Which do you think Sadena would prefer?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Adventuring isn't really something Sadena does. I don't see why she needs a new inventory cube. But then, do earrings named after Siel's heartbreak really give the right message?</p>

          <p>You prefer the rose-patterned cube? I think you're right. I don't want to confess my love with a gift named after tears. Blubbering never got anyone anywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ondanyerk's prices are normally sky high, but love has no price! Unless you fall in love with someone from the Vanahal District...</p>

          <p>If you go and order the inventory cube from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_3], I'll go and make some extra money. It'll take a while for the cube to be made, so I should have enough time.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think you're right. Most of the girls I've ever dated were obsessed with jewelry, and all of the women in the Vanahal District seem to wear them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Lanse is a Handicrafting master... her earrings won't come cheap. I'd better stop wasting time talking, and go to earn some Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please order the earrings from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lanse] for me. I hope her work is as good as her prices suggest.</p>

          <p>No no...you have made a good decision with the rose-patterned cube, Daeva. Very pretty cube. Not many orders come in for them. The materials are so rare and the cost so high.</p>
