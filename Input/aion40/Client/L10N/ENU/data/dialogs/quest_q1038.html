          <p>We don't know, but when I got here, the Mystic Spring was dried up and Philipemos was gone.</p>

          <p>I contacted the Temple of Life. They dispatched Sirink to take care of the Mystic Spring. Together we looked for Philipemos, and eventually found his boot at the entrance of the Kyola Temple.</p>

          <p>But we didn't dare go inside the temple. There are...bad things in there, and we're not warriors. [%username], will you go into the Kyola Temple and look for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_pilifemos]? </p>
