          <p>Arieluma, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today is lucky for you! Takurunerk have only shipment of new armor in area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>New armor well-priced, especially for hundredth customer. Notice new shipment not made with any Balaur material, very pure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only meant for very talented Daevas, though. New weapons very good, very strong, but keep only for certain time. Only the best Daevas can use them wisely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, look. Takurunerk let you hold onto things before buying.</p>
