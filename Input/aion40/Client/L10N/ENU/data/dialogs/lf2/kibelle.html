          <p>Sometimes this place really gets on my nerves. It's so hot and desolate, very few people come here and there's nothing to do off duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The one bright spot here is Dionera. Strange that you have to come to such a terrible place to meet someone you can really care about, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Observatory isn't a great place to serve, but at least we have each other. We're hoping to get transferred at the same time. I couldn't bear it if we were separated by duty.</p>
