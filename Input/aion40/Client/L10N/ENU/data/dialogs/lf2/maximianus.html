          <p>I'm so sick of this post. When I talk to my friends in Sanctum, I'm embarrassed to tell them I work in the Eltnen fortress.</p>

          <p>Everybody knows that Brigade General Telemachus is the commander here, and it just rubs my feathers backward to be under the command of a young kid like him. Sure he ascended a long time ago. So what? Look at him! He'll always be a kid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They say he's been in all these battles, but I don't believe it. He's so scrawny. It really annoys me to hear him going on about all the things he's seen. I bet it's all a lie.</p>
