          <p>I may not look it, but I'm pretty well-traveled. Several years ago, I went all the way to Verteron Citadel. The round trip took me about a month. I wore out two pairs of boots!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I visited the Tolbas Village, the thriving forest near the fortress, and the beautiful lake. It was very different from desolate Eltnen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to talk a lot about my trip to Verteron, but lately people get annoyed when I tell them about the beauty and wonders of those far off places. Naga nuts! I think they're just jealous. And to think I brought them those little models of the fortress for their children to play with!</p>
