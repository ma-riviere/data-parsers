          <p>The world we live in is divided by war and chaos, but it is still beautiful. Each year more Daevas are blessed by the Seraphim Lords to ascend, to rise up and defend Elysea against all threats. Isn't that a beautiful thing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose you've been finding Ascension Energy in your cube? That's yet another blessed phenomenon, far beyond my understanding, I'm afraid. I do know that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_LC1_Darin], in Sanctum, will exchange the energy for presents, though.</p>
