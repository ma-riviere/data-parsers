          <p>Maybe Agairon Village would be better off without me. I'm not able to protect everyone. Everyday we lose another villager to disease or famine. Now the villagers are losing hope.</p>

          <p>Even Empyrean Lady Yustiel's Mystic Spring has been taken over by Lepharist Revolutionaries....</p>

          <p>I failed Isson and now I'm failing them all.</p>

          <p>Should we evacuate everyone to the fortress? The young people will adapt, but it would be hard for the old folks to leave their homes. It's not easy to leave the place you've lived in all your life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't sleep for worry. What shall we do? Oh, I wish Isson was here. Alas, I failed him too.</p>
