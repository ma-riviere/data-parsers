          <p>It's not a story the Shadow Council likes to advertise. A Shadow Judge called Kromede was banished for corruption. For many years she wandered in exile, but then came to Morheim searching for a weapon. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the Sky Temple of Arkanis was said to house a powerful Daevic weapon, guarded in a secret chamber by Agnita, a Daeva of Flame.</p>

          <p>Kromede tried all sorts of tricks to take over the temple. But Agnita was powerful and cunning and the Temple had some traps of its own. In the end, they were both sealed inside the secret chamber. At least Kromede's machinations were foiled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since then, numerous Daevas have attempted to rescue Agnita and dispose of Kromede, but hardly anyone even makes it back alive.</p>

          <p>Not quite. I'm sure it's no surprise the Shadow Court is eager to clean up this mess and rescue Agnita. I think you might be the Daeva to succeed.</p>

          <p>Agnita's servant [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bulagan] is still in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_C5]. If he's still loyal, he'll help.</p>
