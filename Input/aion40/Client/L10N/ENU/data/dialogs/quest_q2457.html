          <p>Do you know a Daeva of Fishing named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lif]?</p>

          <p>Well, Lif claims to have caught Lasayo Fish, which are known to lay eggs only once every hundred years! And even Daevic Fish, whose progenitor was a Daeva who had been transformed into a fish by divine punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, she says the only fish she's failed to catch is...Gadill! Does that make any sense to you at all?</p>

          <p>Ha! Have you ever fished at all?! Gadill is one of the most common fish around!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It just seems so weird that a Daeva of Fishing, who claims to have caught all the rarest fish in the world, has failed to catch even a single Gadill!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I do feel sorry for her too. It'd be nice if we could give her some hope. Oh, I know! Why don't you catch some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_d_n_c_20a] and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lif]? Show her it's not impossible.</p>

          <p>I think if you catch five [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_d_n_c_20a] and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lif], that should be enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gadill is plentiful in this river, so you don't need to go far.</p>
