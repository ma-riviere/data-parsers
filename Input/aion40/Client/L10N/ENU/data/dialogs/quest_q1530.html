          <p>I'm sure you noticed ghosts at Orton Farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to legend, residents who died in the Krall War came to life as zombies. I think perhaps there's some truth to that legend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think some also lingered...as ghosts. I sent a letter to a researcher in Sanctum to ask if this was true.</p>

          <p>I'd send a sample but it would be forever before I heard something. I'm lucky I'm a Daeva. If I were Human, I'd be dead before they got back to me.</p>

          <p>Klaus consulted Sanctum about the Undead, and they told him to send samples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to the Orton Farm and collected the Anubite Skulls. Then, Klaus said that the Undead and Lepharist Revolutionaries are somehow connected.</p>
