          <p>Would you do me a favor, [%username]? You have been of a great help to our Desert Scout Camp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can see you preparing to leave us, and I need to send a letter somewhere remote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just one more bit of help for us, and you can forget about this place.</p>

          <p>I have written a report describing our recent missions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sending it to the Fortress, but I think it will also be helpful to the Golden Bough Legion in their Garrison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I would like to ask you to deliver the report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Castor], the Golden Bough Brigade General.</p>

          <p>Neither the Guardians, the Golden Bough Legion, nor the Daevas of Life can stop the desertification of Eltnen, though they do their best. </p>

          <p>Our time here has been hard, and the desert is one opponent we cannot defeat. But they should at least know that we try.</p>
