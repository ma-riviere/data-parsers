          <p>No...no, it didn't work. More things have been stolen by the Manduri, and I can't keep asking...ACHOO...asking passing Daevas to help bring them back. What can we do?</p>

          <p>There must be another way to stop their menace....</p>

          <p>[%username]! That's it! That's perfect!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's only since [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriTNamed_22_An] took over that the thefts have really become a problem. If we can remove him, then perhaps the Manduri will be less inclined to keep on taking our belongings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's just one problem. We don't call him "Wily" for nothing.</p>

          <p>Harder than a greased Bellepig. What's worse, we don't even know where his den is, and so can only try to catch him when he turns up at the main Manduri settlements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've commissioned others to find him and take him down, but no one has ever been successful. Ah...ACHOO! Oh...where was I? Oh, never mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about you, [%username]? We haven't had a [%userclass] try it yet, and the bounty is quite hefty these days.</p>

          <p>Great! With any luck, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriTNamed_22_An] is about to meet his match and we'll be able to finally reassure the residents that the thefts will be over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, as I said, we don't know where his den is, so I'm afraid you'll have to head to the Manduri Village or Food Storage, and wait for him. Of course, if you wanted to pass the time by killing some of the other Manduri there, no one would stop you.</p>

          <p>You might even find some interesting trinkets on them, kleptomaniacs that they are. Faith and...ACHOO!</p>
