          <p>The Kaidan Headquarters is practically on top of us, then the Tigric problems, and the Krall out there moving about doing Lords know what!</p>

          <p>Oh, and not to mention this latest report about the suspicious movements of the Mamaki tribe! What if they are planning to attack us?! How are we supposed to keep track of so many problems?!</p>

          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. It's just...well, this heat puts us all on edge, I guess. We just don't have enough scouts or sentinels to keep track of everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen, I...I know your reputation is deserved, and we've got some serious problems, [%username]. I think you're the right one to handle this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need a little breathing room. I'm thinking that someone needs to strike at the Kaidan Headquarters and give those Mamaki ruffians a bloody nose. Make them think twice about attacking us. Are you up for it?</p>

          <p>Thank you. If we can just get one of these threats under control, it might let us focus enough on the rest of them.</p>

          <p>That was fast. I expected it to take much longer.</p>

          <p>I received Temple training myself, but I guess I have a long way to go to catch up with you.</p>

          <p>Anyway, thanks to you, we don't need to worry about the Mamaki tribe for the time being. Maybe we're beginning to make progress for a change!</p>
