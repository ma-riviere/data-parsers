          <p>Brigade General Nerita, the Fortress Commander of Beluslan, sent the report herself. She saw Lepharist Revolutionaries with strange animals, and requested intelligence on the creatures.</p>

          <p>According to the information you collected from Elysea, Lepharist Revolutionaries created Pretors...but to what end? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you'd better go to Beluslan to investigate. Go meet Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nerthus] to get the details.</p>
