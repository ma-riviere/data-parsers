          <p>Manastones, manastones, manastones...all over Eltnen. The Manastone Removers Association used to be headquartered here, because of the abundance of the stuff.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so much anymore, though. I take it that you've heard about what happened? Getting unionized.... Those damn Shugos and their strange business practices! Why did we listen to them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm looking for 10 each of the HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones. That's the way these orders come in sometimes: in bulk bundles. Damn Shugos. Any chance you could hunt some down for me? Manastones, I mean....</p>

          <p>I've got a bundle of nice new manastones in return for those older ones I asked you to find. Those old HP +40 deals...already obsolete, Daeva. Can you believe it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I spent the best years of my life assembling those HP +40s, and now we can't even pawn them off on Shugos...or those tree-loving Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I was another foot taller, I'd really give that Union Manager a piece of my mind! Well, do you have any in your cube or warehouse?</p>

          <p>[%username], just because the times are changing doesn't mean the manastone business is changing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I take that back. The manastone business did change quite a bit. Too much, if you ask me. Damn Shugos and their union ideas. Lazy little savages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand your hesitation, Daeva. I'd probably do the same. Faith and arms then.</p>

          <p>Sufferin' Siel! Half of these manastones I have are on their last legs...barely worth the trouble of recharging them. Daevas don't want to buy this old junk anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But between you and me, [%username], I'm selling this lot to a clan of Shugos who just came in from Theobomos. How's that for justice, huh? A little payback.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway...any luck with those bundles of HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones I asked you about?</p>

          <p>You're as deaf as those Shugos! I need 10 apiece, Daeva. 10 of the HP +40s, 10 of the Accuracy +16s, and 10 of the Block +16s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're looking at 30 total. Maybe I wasn't clear enough... Maybe you didn't hear me way up there?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, those Shugo buyers I had lined up are late as usual, so see if you can hunt down those manastones for me in the next hour or so, eh?</p>

          <p>Nice...nice...all 30 accounted for. Nice and crummy, too. These stones couldn't charge up a Kerubar's backwind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait till those Shugos get a load of these, eh? Ah...sweet justice is served.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here are the new manastones I promised you as payment. I built 'em myself...got a little kick to them.</p>
