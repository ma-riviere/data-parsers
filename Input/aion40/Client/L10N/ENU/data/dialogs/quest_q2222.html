          <p>It took us ten years to buy that house! Groken would agree--we aren't ready to just give it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Karl] might help. He is a hunter living in Basfelt Village. He comes through here sometimes and is friendly with us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if he'd help us? Could you go and explain the situation to him?</p>
