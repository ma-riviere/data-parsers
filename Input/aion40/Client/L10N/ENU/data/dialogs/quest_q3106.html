          <p>Centurion is hard Human. Will surely order punishment. Failure is not tolerated here, only prompt obedience.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes! Caochenrinerk could substitute carved ivory horns for bricks and make glues by mixing something sticky, akakakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Small amounts will be decorative, yes? Just as strong as stone bricks, and much fiercer, raaar!</p>

          <p>If Daeva can procure [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3106a] for ivory and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3106b] for sticky fluid, everything will work out fine.</p>

          <p>Will change name and run away. Just donâ€™t tell Centurion where she's gone, yes?</p>
