          <p>Interested in cooking, eh? Get in line. Ever since Armandino demonstrated his carving skills on the Balaur, every Daeva in Asmodae wants to be a warrior chef. And who do you think taught them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me! Lainita, Daeva of Cooking, that's who.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've trained the best. Cooking is an art to be respected and reckoned with. And from now on I'm only going to train chefs who can dominate a battlefield as well as a kitchen.</p>

          <p>Really. Cooks should be respected. When we struggled to survive after the Tower fell, warriors protected us, but cooks...cooks fed us. A few--like Armandino and Batali--did both. Good food was a rare comfort in that bitter cold time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It takes devotion to make a meal out of what you can forage and scrape together. People need to respect that devotion. If you have the proper respect for cooking, [%username], then I'll teach you.</p>

          <p>We'll start with basics, and you can't get much more basic than roasted Conide. Seafood is flight-food and brain food.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_GB_SOURCE_SHELL_D_10A]s and roast them here. I'll be the judge of your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You CAN buy roasted Conide from food merchants, but nothing tastes quite like fresh Conide you've roasted yourself. Making makes the tasting good. Remember that.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_GB_SOURCE_SHELL_D_10A]s at Altgard Ice Lake are the best you'll find anywhere. Sweet, fat, plentiful, and just lying there waiting to be plucked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One more thing...if you've never cooked before, you'd best bring a few extra Conide. You'll probably burn one or two of them before you get the knack of roasting them to perfection.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Mmm. I like Conide, it's squishy. So. Did you feel connected to our ancestors, out there on the ice?  Do you understand how much all Asmodians owe to those who cook for the rest?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taking the cook's path is not easy. But don't worry if people take your skills for granted. When they're cold and hungry, they'll come a-begging.</p>
