          <p>Excuse me, are you [%username]? I thought so--your reputation precedes you.</p>

          <p>People say you have done great deeds in Eltnen. Amazing, especially considering you don't seem to have been a Daeva for long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping you would pass this way, actually. I could use some help.</p>

         <p>Yes, I've heard your timing is often impeccable.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Anyway, the trouble is that some precious relics have gone missing. I found them only a few days ago--a large pile of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1512a]--but I couldn't carry them all by myself.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>When I went back with a few others to collect the rest, they were gone.</p>

          <p>A shame, indeed. It's not the statues alone that have gone missing, however. There was also a small [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1512b]. It emanated large amounts of Aether, so I was afraid to bring it back alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm certain the Lepharists are behind this. How would you like to .</p>

          <p>Oh, what a relief.</p>

          <p>I've seen a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparWa3_33_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparKnight_33_An]s hanging around the area recently. It had to be them--I'm certain of it.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go after them and retrieve the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1512a]s and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1512b] for me, please.</p>

          <p>A [%userclass] who shows up at just the right moment and accepts any task that you require? Such is the stuff of Shugo tales.</p>

          <p>I love being right. I hope you taught them not to put their grubby, thieving hands on our relics.</p>
