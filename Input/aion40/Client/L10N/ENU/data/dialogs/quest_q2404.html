          <p>I patrolled the eastern side of the village with Letum a few days ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There were a lot of Tipolids in the Tripeed field, so we chased them down and killed most of them. We didn't want them to damage the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But a villager came to me yesterday and said that Tipolids had damaged the field since then. It doesn't seem possible that they could have come back in such numbers so quickly.</p>

          <p>Perhaps.... But the reason is less important than the fact that they're back. I told my commander that we took care of them, and now it will seem that I am either a liar or incompetent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone to go hunt those Tipolids before word gets back to the wrong person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it? I can make it worth your time.</p>
