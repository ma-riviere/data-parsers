          <p>My neighbors might tell you my husband, Amitnir, has lost his mind. But I love him all the same!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm the one earning our living now, and no one is as skilled at butchering as I am.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only time business is poor is the hunters' off season.</p>
