          <p>I never imagined I'd be a prison guard when I was first assigned here. Frankly speaking, it isn't anything to brag about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's pointless. Say the prisoners magically get out of their cells. They'll flee the dungeon--right into the middle of an armed encampment on the surface.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Escapees with any sense would run right back into their cells!</p>
