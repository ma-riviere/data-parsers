          <p>Look at him! Kaindal, I mean. Face like a Sparkie's backside.</p>

          <p>That face shows it all--you can tell his sap quota ain't yet been filled.</p>

          <p>Yeah, maybe. Keeps us lot on our toes at any rate.</p>

          <p>I can't say I feel sorry for Kaindal, but he does have to work with Motgar. Now, there's the laziest slob I've ever seen.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Doesn't help that Kaindal's so soft on him, either. A good, hard shove and Motgar might be worth a Kinah or two.</P>
