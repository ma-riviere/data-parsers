          <p>Yes! And even more interesting, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3540A]s only grow on [%dic:STR_DIC_M_XipetoMove_34_An]s. No one knows why.</p>

          <p>Atalante, our local Daeva of Zephyr, has been asking for some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what she's going to use them for. She's not the type to tip her hand, but knowing her, it's bound to be for something important.</p>

          <p>I'd like to get the mushrooms to her as soon as possible, but I can't get anyone to go mushroom hunting. Everyone seems to be behind schedule today.</p>

          <p>Thanks, [%username].</p>

          <p>You can collect the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3540A]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_XipetoMove_34_An]s in the Decayed Grove.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have enough, take them directly to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Atalante]. Maybe you can get her to spill about what she's going to do with them.</p>
