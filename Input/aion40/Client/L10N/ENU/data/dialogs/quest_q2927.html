          <p>She said the Heart in Love was a mere metaphor. It can't make up for my being from a humble family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And all her friends were making fun of her for seeing a poor guy like me.</p>

          <p>The other two are in Beluslan, I hear. Some of the Balaur are carrying them around. You're a Daeva, so you should be out there killing Balaur anyway.</p>
