          <p>The Lifeform Remodeling Report is too simplistic to guide my research efforts. It's little more than a brief.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I'm focusing on now are the Drana and Dragel. What fascinates me is how they used the Dragel to remodel lifeforms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It goes without saying that I'll need samples.</p>

          <p>Would you retrieve some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3915a] for me, [%username]? It would be tremendously helpful.</p>

          <p>If we have the Dragel, it will go a long way towards advancing our research of the Balaur warfare.</p>

          <p>Thank the Seraphim Lords! I'm relieved you see how vital this research is, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kobolds and Fungens have been mutated by the Dragel, so start with collecting samples from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3915a]s will help us start answering our questions.</p>
