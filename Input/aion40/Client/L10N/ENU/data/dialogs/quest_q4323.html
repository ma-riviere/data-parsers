          <p>Matilda, beautiful Matilda, how can I carry on without you, my sweet?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, [%username], I didn't see you there. Just ignore my ramblings.... I'm just reminiscing about when I was a farmer, and I couldn't protect those I loved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Matilda...that marvelous snout, those adorable little hooves, the way you snorted after rolling in mud. I'll never meet another Porgus like you! Blast those villanous Spriggs who took you away!</p>

          <p>You could never understand the bond we shared, [%username]. It was special...but now all I think about is getting vengeance on the Spriggs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those infernal creatures took Matilda away and did Azphel knows what to her! My blood boils whenever I think about it.... They could be capturing someone else's prized Porgus right now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no more--the terror ends now. There will be blood. Will you help me put a stop to the Sprigg tyranny, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Venture to the north of the Alsig Village, and you will find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg2_32_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg3_33_An]s. Show the foul creatures no mercy, [%username]. Kill them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a soldier now, but a farmer does not become a soldier overnight. You can make those tyrannical Spriggs suffer more than I ever could. </p>

          <p>Yes! Now no other farmer will have to suffer as I did. Matilda's spirit can now rest in peace, and perhaps I can as well.... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must ensure the Spriggs don't return. The savages are resilient. Here, take this, and my deepest thanks.</p>
