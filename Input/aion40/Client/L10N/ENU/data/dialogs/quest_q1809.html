          <p>Well, we hope it will be. But it's not as easy as I anticipated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Asmodians in particular caused a few problems! They must have figured out what we were doing. They destroyed all the data we had collected on the Roah Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since then the garrison tightened its security, and we're unable to get close enough to do much useful research now. Perhaps you could assist us?</p>
