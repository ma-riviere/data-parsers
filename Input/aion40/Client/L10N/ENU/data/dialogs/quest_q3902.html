          <p>Have you heard of the Esoteric Books of Freedom? They contain the secrets and techniques of Rangers and Assassins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jumentis is currently charged as their keeper. I borrowed the first volume from him and I'd like to return it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I can neither leave my post nor entrust an Esoteric Book to just anyone. On the other hand, you're hardly just anyone.</p>

          <p>I've heard you're one of Lord Vaizel's faithful [%userclass]s. That's encouraging as our struggles seem unending.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this Esoteric Book of Freedom to Jumentis in Protectors Hall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guard it well, [%username]. The pages were written in blood, not ink--costly blood.</p>

          <p>Jumentis specializes in poisons, though he's well versed in all of the techniques of Lord Vaizel. I think he just likes the taste of poisons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the antidotes that taste like refuse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you wish to study our deeper mysteries, you'll find him an invaluable resource.</p>

          <p>Ah. Wonderful. The Esoteric Books of Freedom are nothing but gibberish to those who don't know our argot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So Eumelos feels you're ready to delve deeper into the Lord of Freedom's secrets? So be it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to learn our ways, work with me. I'll devise a regimen appropriate for your skills and experience.</p>
