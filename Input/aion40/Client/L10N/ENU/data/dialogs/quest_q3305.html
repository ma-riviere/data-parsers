          <p>Hah--the timing! I was about ready to contact you, [%username]. I was going to ask you to join us in a Lepharist clean-up operation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brigade General Telemachus says he can't tolerate the Lepharist activities any longer and has ordered a full-scale operation against them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, since it's not possible to mobilize enough Guardians, he has ordered us to recruit mercenaries.</p>

          <p>Of course. Rewards vary depending on the difficulties of the mission. The mission I'm offering is to gather 120 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_LEHPAR_QUEST_01A]s. The reward is a pair of earrings.</p>

          <p>Thanks, [%username]. A big name like you is sure to attract others. I just hope they come soon....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_LEHPAR_QUEST_01A] is the symbol of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_3304all]. That means only the best of the best Lepharists can wear it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that means you need to get ready for a big old fight. They won't hold back.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry to hear that. You may not be aware of this, but there are quite a few Daevas who respect you, [%username]. If they see you join this operation, many of them will follow your example.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I hoped you'd join. </p>

          <p>Exactly 120 insignias. Excellent. Here's the reward list for the mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each set of earrings has a different function. Make sure you pick the ones you like, because you can't trade after you choose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are also missions that offer a necklace and a ring, if you're interested in completing the set.</p>
