          <p>[%username], now you're wearing the uniform of the Miragent Holy Templars. But there's one more challenge...one that will give you the right to the Miragent's Holy Templar title as well.</p>

          <p>The last test will check your loyalty to Sanctum and your flexibility in working together with other members.</p>

           <p>We Elyos have many enemies. And Calydons are among the most dangerous.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>They seized part of Theobomos, the land that our ancestors and comrades risked their lives to settle, and the Calydons have no intention of returning it to us.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Go to Theobomos and eliminate [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAssassin_49_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonMage_49_An]s so that they will know the unyielding will of the Elyos!</p>
