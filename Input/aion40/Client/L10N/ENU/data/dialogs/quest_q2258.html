          <p>Now that the Spirits have quieted down, we can move forward with the reconstruction of Impetusium. I think I smell an opportunity!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need this strategic point for our battle against the Sapiens. Pandaemonium's full attention will be focused on this project. If I distinguish myself here, I'll be famous. This could be my chance for promotion!</p>

        	<p>I'm acquainted with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lindhog], the Information Officer in Pandaemonium. Would you ask him to announce that I, Grak, have achieved a glorious feat for the reconstruction of Impetusium?</p>
