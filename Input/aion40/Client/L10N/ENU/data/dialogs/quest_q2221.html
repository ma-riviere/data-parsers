          <p>Last night Lepharist Revolutionaries broke into my house!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My uncle and I were both asleep when it happened. We each jumped up and ran out of the house, but we split up to get away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw him running toward the falls, but I haven't seen him since then and I'm too terrified to go anywhere near the house again. Will you look for him?</p>
