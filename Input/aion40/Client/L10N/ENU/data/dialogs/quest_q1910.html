          <p>I wish to speak to you about a poison seeping through our society. A danger that threatens everything we hold dear.</p>

          <p>I speak, of course, of the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>

          <p>The "revolutionaries" that would destroy us! So ethereal that when you catch a glimpse of them and reach into the darkness, you return with little more than shadows and dust.</p>

          <p>My thanks.</p>

          <p>The Lepharist Revolutionaries infest the Verteron region. They seem to base themselves at [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA24], so it would be wise to start there.</p>
          <p> </p>   
          <p>Defeat them and return with any [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_v_s_09d]s you find. And keep this between us.</p>
