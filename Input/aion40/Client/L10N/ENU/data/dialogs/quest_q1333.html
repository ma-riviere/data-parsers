          <p>Sataloca's power is easy to see--just look at the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Bonedrake_26_An]s and you can't deny it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Acheron Drakes are not living creatures, you know. They were created by Sataloca--even though nothing remains of him save his heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He doesn't even need his body for such feats! What a disaster if he were to resurrect....</p>

          <p>We need to study the Acheron Drakes if we're to really understand what Sataloca is capable of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can figure out how he made them, and how they work, then we'll have a much better idea--and also know better how to combat his power.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1333a]s. Drake Horns from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Bonedrake_26_An]s--if you could bring them back here for study, we'd learn so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The horns seem to be important--I suspect they're sensors, receiving commands from Sataloca.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By analyzing them, we may find their weakness and Sataloca's...then we can destroy his heart, preventing Sataloca from ever resurrecting. Will you go?</p>

          <p>That will be such a help. Three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1333a]s should be enough for my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You won't need to go far--they tend to stay around Sataloca's Tomb. I'll analyze them when you bring them back, and probably send a sample to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Quick now. We need to get this taken care of.</p>
