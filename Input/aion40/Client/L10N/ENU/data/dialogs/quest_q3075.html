          <p>The Parched Barrens is a dangerous place, and too many travelers get injured despite our efforts to protect them. Word has it you possess the talent and skill to protect yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must guard the entrance to the Barrens--leaving our post is not possible. If we had more Guardians, perhaps we could escort people to the Observatory, but for now that's not an option.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing to assist us? We need to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_Basilisk_45_An]s over in the Barrens. That should reduce the risk significantly.</p>

          <p>Oh! While you're out there, you'll see [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_DionaeaRed_45_An]s as well. They seem innocuous at first, just like big plants, but appearances can be deceiving out here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>The Observatory Guardians are supposed to clear these creatures from the road on a regular basis, but they've fallen behind and it's becoming dangerous. Diokuroi is the Guardian in charge of this task at the Observatory, but something must have distracted him.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get there, let Diokuroi know I asked you to take care of it--this time. Your service is appreciated, [%username]. Soar in the light.</p>

          <p>Well, as you must. I'd rather lose my wings than ignore such a challenge, but you know your own business best, I'm sure.</p>

          <p>Do yourself a favor, though, and keep it in mind. We'll have no shortage of Basilisks between now and then, regardless.</p>
