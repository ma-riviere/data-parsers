          <p>We're trying to reach Agairon Village, [%username]. It's our only chance of surviving here in Eltnen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Agairon village has two things going for it. Firstly, their spring hasn't dried up. The desert may be getting closer each day, but the spring grants water, and Agairon survives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Secondly, the village is protected by Eltnen Guardians. Lepharists would never dare attack a place guarded by some of Elysea's strongest immortals.</p>

          <p>Perhaps. But even staying here is tough on us, and young Teos...he's had a torrid time recently. He's had to bury both of his parents on our travels, and he's now so...so quiet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The joy of youth is slipping away from my poor nephew. He doesn't eat, he barely sleeps, and he bursts into tears so often.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It breaks my heart. I can't help but wish things were better for him, even at my own expense.</p>

          <p>She lives in Agairon Village. I'm sure Teos will be back to his old self once he's with his Nana. Would you have the time to do this for us though? We can't leave yet....</p>
