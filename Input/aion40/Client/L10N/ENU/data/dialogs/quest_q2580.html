          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. You know, the ways of Soul Healing never fail to fascinate me. Did you know Soul Healing does not work on those who are left after their body is destroyed?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't you find it strange? We can heal souls, but not without a body.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soul Healers know the reason for that, of course. Our body and soul are parts of a whole, not merely pieces.</p>

          <p>As an example, there is a poor spirit hovering about the Anair Lighthouse. He's an Archon named Valconor, whose mission was guarding the lighthouse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even at death, however, he still cannot forsake his duty and rest in peace. Someone must persuade him to return to the flow of Aether.</p>
