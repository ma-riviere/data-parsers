          <p>No! Nothing twiggy like that--don't worry. But it will be a tough task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's time to cut the heart out of the Elyos fighting force: the Elyos Army Generals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are about 30 Elyos army commanders and generals combined. Despite their small number, they inspire the Elyos troops and fighting spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By defeating them, you'll crush the Elyos spirit and raise the morale of the Asmodian army.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've proven your reliability time and again, [%username]. That's why I selected you for this mission.</p>

          <p>Isolating these powerful [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade01]s and taking them down will be your toughest task to date.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There aren't very many, and we only want you killing those of comparable skill to you. What's worse, they're unlikely to be alone. Even a tough [%userclass] like you will want some allies for this task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful, and don't get reckless.</p>
