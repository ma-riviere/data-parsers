          <p>I decided to cook up the Gadill you brought me, and send it to a friend of mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vivi is a...well, a Sprigg. I know it's unusual to have a Sprigg for a friend, but Vivi is quite unique.</p>

          <p>I suppose, but it's no matter to me. I've lived long enough not to care what others think.</p>

          <p>Actually, I wager you'd really like Vivi. He's actually quite intelligent for a Sprigg.</p>

          <p>Ha! He's written a poem for me. Who could imagine a Sprigg writing poetry! It begins, "Oh pointy fish, oh pointy pointy...."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Very strange. Different from what any Daeva would write, but that's part of its charm. Thank you so much for bringing this to me. </p>
