          <p>You may not be aware of this, [%username], but the Lepharists also operate in Elysea. Their numbers are about the same as we have here, and their agenda seems to be the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The difference is their avenue of research. We believe that the Lepharists in Elysea are creating Human weapons.</p>

          <p>They're conducting experiments at an Aetherogenetics Lab deep inside the Poya Jungle in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, that's all we know. We don't know how many of these Human weapons they've created, or what powers they possess. If the Lepharists were to deploy them here in Asmodae, we'd have no idea how to fight them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why we're launching an investigation. I need someone to infiltrate the Lepharist Research Center in Elysea. What do you say?</p>

          <p>The Aetherogenetics Lab is in Elysea's Poya Jungle, in the Heiron region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll infiltrate using a rift to that region. There should be a gateway to Elysea in the Lepharist base in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Once you enter the secret laboratory, locate a [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_FOBJ_Q4907A]. Find out the names of their successful test subjects, then obtain Organic Samples from them.</p>

          <p>Procedural Log: Transplanted Slime's poison organ to 10 Humans. 5 subjects expired. Remaining subjects suffered high fever and blue skin discoloration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Discoloration and fever subsequently diminished, being absent from all subjects by day 15. Four subjects suffered deafness, and dramatic reduction in intelligence. The sole exception will hereinafter be designated RM-108c, the others collectively RM-113b.</p>

          <p>400 varieties of poison were injected or force-fed to the subject. Subject's visual and auditory nerves were replaced with tissue from RM-5c and RM-60c. Balaur muscle tissue successfully transplanted to subject.</p>

          <p>Testing determined that subjects' vision and auditory senses are similar to RM-78c, but combat skills are only equal to elite soldiers.</p>

          <p>RM-108c, RM-138c? They use the designation RA in Asmodae, and it seems that it's RM in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's worrisome that these Human weapons are advanced enough to be in battle testing at a base called Azoturan. That could mean they'll be ready to deploy soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll study these immediately, and look for ways to counter them. You've done well.</p>

          <p>Kushar was shocked to hear that Human weapons are being battle-tested in Azoturan, and declared that the samples must be studied immediately to find ways to counter them.</p>
