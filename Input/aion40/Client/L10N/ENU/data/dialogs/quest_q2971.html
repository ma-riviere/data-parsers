          <p>How do you fight a war when you can’t even trust your suppliers?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I send for a batch of freshly lathed blades and find two, three, sometimes more, missing. I order Sobi robes, and the stock arrives incomplete.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The other week, I received a crate that was addressed to Ishalgen. It was full of jeweled anklets. What do they expect us to do, dazzle the Balaur with our sense of style?!</p>

          <p>Yes! This is it! The missing robe. There are a lot of tatty fakes going around, you know. Can’t be too careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems like war brings out the worst in some people. But you, you’ve brought this robe all the way out here so that our Daeva won’t be found wanting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You’ve shown real dedication. It’s not only our weapons and armor that are in short supply. Asmodae needs as many Daeva like you as it can muster.</p>
