          <p>War is just a horror. The landscape suffers, towns are burned, and people always die. Sometimes the innocent don't even return to the flow of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know much about how it happens, but some souls become...undead, doomed to wander these fields forever.</p>

          <p>No one knows for sure, but this land is crawling with undead. Just step outside the village. It's not like they try to hide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At Sudorville, the undead were once farmers and merchants and tradesmen. They were either exposed to the contamination or killed by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've been roaming the land for hundreds of years without purpose. It's nightmarish.</p>

          <p>Indeed they can. That's the bright spot in all this, really. Fortunately it's not a complicated matter. If we destroy them, their souls will be released back to the flow of Aether. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Under Commander Surt's leadership we've been making progress, but it's slow going. I was hoping you might lend us your strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely you can dispatch them much faster. Any progress you make would put us that much closer to reclaiming Brusthonin.</p>

          <p>I volunteered for this assignment. I was reluctant to attack the undead at first. It was creepy, of course, but I also felt guilty for attacking them--it's not really their fault they're undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once I realized that killing them releases their souls to the flow of Aether, though, I felt better.</p>

          <p>Thank you. This is a great service to Brusthonin.</p>

          <p>Someday all the undead will be sent to rest. When that day comes, I hope you will return here to see the beauty hiding beneath the blight on this land.</p>
