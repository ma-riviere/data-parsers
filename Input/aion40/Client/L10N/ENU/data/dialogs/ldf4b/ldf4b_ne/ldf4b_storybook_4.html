        	<p>Chapter 5: Turning POTCRAB into PROFIT!</p>
          <p>So far I, Malinerk, have told you the secrets to GETTING WHAT YOU WANT by using the DAEVA OF OPPORTUNITY--how to find your POTCRAB!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is all about seeing OPPORTUNITY when others RUN AWAY! But you do not have to take my word for it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here is a TRUE STORY of how "B" saw his POTCRAB and TOOK IT!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>B was unhappy. Mugged by Shulacks, miserable and broke, he was walking home through the Crimson Barrens with not a Kinah to his name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He stopped at a strange tree. Where all the others were dead, this one had leaves. At the very top, he saw a necklace glittering against the green.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A strange place for a necklace! But he needed Kinah, so he climbed the tree.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Halfway up the tree, he noticed that it was not a very nice necklace after all, but strange-looking. "Oh no," thought B. "This is not what I had hoped."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He could have given up. But no--he got the necklace anyway, and climbed back down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as his paws touched the dirt, the tree transformed into a woman! "Oh no," thought B. "This is also not what I hoped!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He could have run away. But no--he saw that the woman was a Daeva, and finely dressed. She was also crying, and looked lost and confused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>B thought this could be a chance to make some Kinah, so he hid the necklace in his pocket and then tried to calm her down.</p>

          <p>Her name was Medina, and she told B her story.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was from a wealthy family, had Ascended early, and had known no difficulties in life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She fell in love with a handsome and ambitious young Daeva named Astor. There were stories about Astor and other women, but Medina didn't care.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She married him despite her father's opposition. At first things were good, but as Astor enjoyed more and more success he spent less time with Medina.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There were new rumors that Astor had only married Medina for her money.</p>

          <p>One day, Astor asked Medina to go on a trip with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She thought it was odd that he would want to take her to Theobomos, of all places. But he said it was for work and they could spend time together on the journey.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Medina still found it strange, but she was so happy Astor was being kind to her again that she agreed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were traveling through a remote part of the Crimson Barrens when Astor stopped the cart.</p>

          <p>In the middle of that wasteland, Asor handed her a box.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He apologized for being so cold and distant and said he would change. Medina opened the box and found a strange necklace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Medina put the necklace on happily and turned to thank Astor, but she was stuck. She watched in horror as her feet grew roots and her hands grew leaves and her mouth filled up with bark.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then she watched as her husband drove the cart away without looking back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Medina finished her story, she was shaking with rage. She begged B to help her find Astor and get revenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Oh my," thought B. "This is not what I hoped, either."</p>

          <p>B could have turned Medina down. After all, what was in it for him?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no. B sensed a once-in-a-lifetime chance. He drew up a contract for his commission right on the spot, to be paid when Medina regained the fortune she had lost to Astor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>B took Medina to Sanctum and tracked down Astor. He was engaged to another wealthy woman, and had told Medina's family that she had joined the Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>B sold the enchanted necklace. He used the Kinah to buy Plastic Surgery Tickets for Medina.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He could have kept the Kinah from the necklace and left. A Daevic revenge plot was not what he hoped for. But no--B was a smarter Shugo than that.</p>

          <p>Medina, with her new face and desire for revenge, lured Astor away from his new woman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took a while, but since she knew him so well, she knew how best to tempt him. Finally he begged her to be with him. But she asked about his new woman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Astor laughed. He told Medina about the enchanted necklace and his wicked plot, and said he would do it again as soon as he was wed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course B was hiding nearby, recording the conversation in an Memory Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Astor was ruined, Medina got her fortune back, and B made an enormous commission. Now B sells the those same enchanted necklaces as joke gifts!</p>

          <p>Isn't that a good story? But how did B DO it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the necklace was not what he hoped, B did not quit. He saw it as an OPPORTUNITY!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Medina appeared, B did not run away. He saw the DAEVA OF OPPORTUNITY in her!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once he had sold the necklace, he KEPT HIS EYES on the goal!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And even after Medina made B rich, he still saw an OPPORTUNITY in the enchanted necklaces!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What did B do? He FOUND his own POTCRAB!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And YOU CAN, TOO!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(What a stupid book. You can't imagine why this is a Shugo bestseller.)</p>
