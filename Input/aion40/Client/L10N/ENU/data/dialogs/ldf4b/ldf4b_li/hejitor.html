          <p>Blasted Kahrun. This would be so much less complicated if we could put those Asmodians in their place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, if we truly need them, perhaps some unequal alliance. Not letting the Asmos near the Artifacts, for example, or keeping plans from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we'll be able to even things out up in the Dredgion, won't we, friend? Ah ha ha! I can't wait!</p>
