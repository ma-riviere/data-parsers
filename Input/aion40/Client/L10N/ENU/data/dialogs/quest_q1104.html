          <p>You bring good news to the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA15]! I'll combine this with the other reports and present them to the villagers later.</p>

          <p>The Akarios Plains are a source of concern for the villagers here, and while some were hesitant to bring in mercenaries, I can now see that our money was well spent. Tell me, though--did you see a farmer in the plains, a man named Kales? He is my cousin, and I have not heard from him in some time. I do hope he is well....</p>

          <p>Oh, and don't worry, I took detailed notes. I know how particular Mires is about his reports.</p>
