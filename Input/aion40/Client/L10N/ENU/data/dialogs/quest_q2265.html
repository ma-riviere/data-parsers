          <p>Have you heard Brigade General Suthran? He's always muttering about the "Sapien scum." He seems to think that offense is the best defense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He attacks them at every opportunity, far more frequently than our former general did.</p>

          <p>I decided to patrol this area by myself, because all of the other watchmen went to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_13] to hunt the Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I couldn't just sit around and do nothing.... My original plan was to go near [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_15] and hunt just a few of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm familiar with that place, so I thought it would be easy. The Mau attacked me in a large pack. I was lucky to have survived!</p>

          <p>Well, that's one word for it. The thing is, though, I lost my sword. It was torn from my hand by a Mau Warrior. I'm so ashamed. I'm an Archon, and I allowed a Sapien to take my sword!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I got this hammer, but it just doesn't feel the same as ol' Swordy. Would you please go to Mahindel Swamp and recover my sword, [%username]? I'll make it up to you, I swear.</p>

          <p>I think the Mau that took my sword was a Veteran Warrior. I was being set upon on all sides, so I didn't see him very well....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely the Mau haven't gone far from the swamp. Kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanFighterS_17_An]s you find there--one of them has to have my sword!</p>
