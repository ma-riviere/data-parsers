          <p>I've always thought of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriT_all] as hopelessly cowardly creatures, and yet they've mustered  the courage to take shelter in one of our abandoned villages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usually, they hide on the periphery of our lands, and only attack lone travellers or injured creatures limping by.</p>

          <p>Centurion Maximus says we can't spare any Guardians, but he suggests we gather a force of our own and drive them from the village without official support.</p>

          <p>No, of course not! The Manduri can't be allowed to impede trade routes to the Fortress!</p>

          <p>I want you to go to the village and kill as many of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriT_all] as you can. Take a scouting party if you wish, and make those creatures know that we want them gone. That's all, [%userclass]. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>Yes. The curse had no effect on me. So the villagers suspected me of betraying their neglect to the Seraphim Five. Eventually, they locked me in here.</p>
