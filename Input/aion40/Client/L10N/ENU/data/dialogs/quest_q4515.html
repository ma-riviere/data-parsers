          <p>Thank you again, [%username], for your help before. But it is not enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As long as the dark energies that animate the undead remain, the Cold Earth Spirits will be corrupted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that is a larger problem for those like me to deal with. We need your help in another arena.</p>

          <p>Exactly. It is harder to tackle the overall problem while they harry our patrols and priests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Furthermore, their Violet Crystals may tell me something about what sort of magic affects the area.</p>

          <p>You have already done so much for us. I suppose it's selfish of me to demand even more of you.</p>

          <p>But next time you pass through Besfer Ghost Village...look upon the suffering undead. Remember the people they once were, and the people who once called that shattered place home.</p>

          <p>The Cold Earth Spirits at Besfer Ghost Village continue to hamper efforts to restore the place. Svera asked you to undertake another round of exorcism.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and brought back Violet Crystals as proof. Besfer is that much closer to being purified.</p>
