          <p>Yes! That Shugo merchant gave me gold with so many impurities that it's unusable. I don't know why I keep doing business with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I demanded a refund but he's being stubborn. Not that the refund would help me much.</p>

          <p>I need the ore more than the Kinah. I have an urgent order.</p>
