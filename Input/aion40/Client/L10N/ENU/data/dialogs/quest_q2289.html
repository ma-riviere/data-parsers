          <p>Basfelt Village is full of bad-tempered hunters who can't go out and hunt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The forest's Mosbears are so wild and violent lately that even the ablest hunters are unnerved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They joke about it. "The Mosbears must have eaten some Skurvish Ginseng!" But I can tell they're nervous and impatient.</p>

          <p>It pains me to to kill such an awe-inspiring creature, but he's dangerous! Go past that bridge a bit and find Shania. Do as she tells you, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearNamed_17_An], and bring his horn to me.</p>
