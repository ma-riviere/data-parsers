          <p>The best kind. The kind that is good for everyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA47]! When they put me here,  Mimiti came to feed me. So kind! So beautiful! I was in love the moment I saw her--the moment!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I was released, I couldn't stand it. So I got caught--on purpose--just so I could be with her. But the Krall won't let me speak to her. Bring Mimiti here, Daeva. Bring her to me and I'll show you how to get your seal.</p>
