          <p>The Dragon Sword is infused with the essences of both death and rebirth. That dualism reflects the philosophy that guides all true warriors--train for war to ensure peace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hurry to the Chamber of Roah and the Asteria Chamber in the Reshanta upper layer, but be careful. If the Balaur spot you, they may conceal the fragments.</p>
