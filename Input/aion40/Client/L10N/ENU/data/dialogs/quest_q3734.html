          <p>One more mission, and you can graduate from [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_L] training camp, hahaha.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By all accounts, there are these [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAB1_MiniCastle_DragonArms_Q3704]s all over the Training Fortress, full of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3704a]s. I was thinking we'd pinch a few, take a look, and see how to counter them. Don't want the enemy getting a drop on us, now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Who knows? I might have the weaponsmiths sabotage them, and get somebody to put them back. That ought to be good for a giggle.</p>

          <p>I'll send these off to Sanctum, and maybe before too long it'll be the Balaur who get the surprise.</p>
