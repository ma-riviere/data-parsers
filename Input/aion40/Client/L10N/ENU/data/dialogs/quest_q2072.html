          <p>Since you made it to the Abyss, we might as well get you some training. A little knowledge will keep you alive--at least a fraction of a second longer, anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lots of Daevas think combat is essentially the same whether they're in the Abyss or in Atreia. Those Daevas spend a lot of time talking to the Soul Healers and visiting their Landing, if you know what I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't waste time on Daevas who can't listen. You get this briefing once and once only.</p>

          <p>All right. Listen up, and I'll tell you how to conquer a fortress without getting yourself killed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if you survive long enough, I'll show you the benefits of seizing a fortress.</p>

          <p>I've been waiting for you, [%username]. And cheer up--Leban gives that "you're about to die" speech to everyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Leban explained how a fortress works, right? Now let's talk about the Aetheric Field that surrounds a fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A fortress's Aetheric Field can be your best friend if you're defending...or your worst enemy if you're attacking. Listen up! I'm going through this only once.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to keep the fortress you've got, you have to protect its gate no matter what. And if you're attacking the fortress, you have to destroy its gate. Again, no matter what.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you can't really understand the Fortress Gate without understanding the Restoration Stone it's connected to. </p>

          <p>You got all that, right? Because the Guardian General determines who has the right to occupy a fortress, it's the key to a fortress victory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But fighting in the Abyss isn't all about fortresses. And that's your next lesson.</p>

          <p>I'll bet everyone's been filling your head with fortress-this and fortress-that, but the strongest weapon in the Abyss is the Artifact. With the right Artifact, you can convert defeat into victory in the blink of an eye.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>And I know what you're thinking. In the hands of the enemy, an Artifact can do the reverse, too.</p>
