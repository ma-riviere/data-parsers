        <p>I know Loriniah--with your help, of course--attacked the MuMu farms to prevent them from growing Odella. Well, those blasted Skurvs are still growing Odella...just less of it.</p>
        <p> </p>	
        <p>So we're going to approach the problem from another angle: stop Odella refining, not Odella growing. After all, the Odella refining happens in just one place: a MuMu village not far from [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_19].</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It should be easier to disrupt a single village than it is to lock down a dozen fields, right?</p>

        <p>The MuMu won't abandon the Odella refining even if they're frightened out of their weak minds. The Mau "protecting" them will make sure of that.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>But if you go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_13] and drive off the Mau, then the MuMu will flee along with them. That means no refined Odella, and we thwart whatever the Mau are planning on doing with it.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>That's your mission: defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lycan_all] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_13]!</p>
