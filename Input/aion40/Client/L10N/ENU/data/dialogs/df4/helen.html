          <p>I still wonder if there are Humans like the Dramata--Humans who fail to take the final step towards ascension, and turn into some kind of monster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've known dozens of Humans who possessed the traits of a Daeva, but none turned into monsters from being unable to ascend.... Well, none that I have known.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard not to feel sorrow for the Dramata's plight. The creatures are outcasts, ridiculed and chastened, but without the Dramata, the Balaur would be much weaker.</p>
