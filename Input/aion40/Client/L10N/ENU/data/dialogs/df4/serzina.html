          <p>Daevas of Asmodae! Now you have a place to call your own, to gain respite from the ravages of war! That place is Pernon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There you may rest in your own home, whether it's a Studio available to every Daeva or a luxurious mansion bought at auction!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To visit Pernon, go to Pandaemonium through the Aerolink and talk to Doman. You will not be disappointed!</p>
