          <p>To think this place could exist in Tiamat's domain.... That they survived so long without Daevas is a miracle!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One reason I'm here is to learn if anything they know or did could help us against the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But maybe I should be talking to the Reians. They supposedly helped the Sapiens survive. Wonder how they did it?</p>
