          <p>Once Tiamat decided to take this area as a nest and base, nothing could dissuade him. Not even Sapiens already being here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He swept in swiftly and ruthlessly, for that is his way. I did what I could, but so many died....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat will not give up this region easily. He may attack again, with even more force than before.</p>
