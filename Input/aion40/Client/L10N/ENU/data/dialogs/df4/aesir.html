          <p>Gelkmaros has been my home for time untold. Much has changed in those years--most of it unpleasant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many of my kin have been born, lived long lives, then died, usually at the hands of the one constant here--the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Now you Asmodians come.... Will you fare better than we have? I sincerely hope so.</p>
