          <p>Having a major holding like this is both exhilarating and nerve-wracking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Keeping it is a big responsibility. If we lose it, no one will remember we had it in the first place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then there's Krizarid--he makes my job both easier and harder.</p>

          <p>Oh, he's strong and valorous, no doubt about it. Some say Drakan hatch from their eggs just so they can run away from Krizarid.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>But sometimes his enthusiasm is...off-putting. I wish he would think a little before acting sometimes.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Still, he helped us get here, and that counts for a lot. Hopefully, this Citadel will be a beacon to all Asmodae.</P>
