          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. You wouldn't happen to have any spare Aether, would you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need some for...a friend. He's got this project he's working on, and.... It's not important, I guess. But I could really use some if you have any. He could, I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd go get it myself, but I'm stuck here doling out rewards. Oh, is that why you're here?.</p>
