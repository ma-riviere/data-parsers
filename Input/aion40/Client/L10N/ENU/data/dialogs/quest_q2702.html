          <p>Deadlock is defeat, blast it! I'll accept no less than Victory against those clawless Elyos! I didn't earn the emblem of the Red Hasia for nothing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must tip the balance with our superior strength and courage. Oh, we will suffer, Daeva, you may count on it, but we will make the Ellies pay with their pretty little lives. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm planning an operation of sorties against the enemy. [%username], will you undertake this critical mission? My Red Hasia Legionaries grow weary of constant battle and need some relief. Little did they know when they raided Elysea for Red Hasia Flowers that they were taking the first steps in an endless war.</p>

          <p>The Elyos are mobilizing their forces, including Guardians and Daevas. The majority of the Elyos troops are Ninth Rank soldiers. While they are not the most experienced fighters, they are formidable foes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to attack those [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade9]s and deal a crushing blow to the enemy's base ranks. Will you carry out this dangerous mission?</p>

          <p>Now go and hunt those [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade9]. Don't waste your time crunching through their weak numbers. Anyone can do that. You, my friend, need to show your worth against the least cowardly of the cowards.</p>
