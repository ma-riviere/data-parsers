          <p>Taking out the captain is the best way to keep the Dredgion from maneuvering to and attacking our fortresses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Dredgion contains more threats to Elysea.</p>

          <p>I mean their ship's weapons and the elite soldiers. Their weapons are nearly indestructable from the outside, but from within, someone only needs to destroy the command controls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And while the elite soldiers of the Baranath Legion are quite formidible when maneuvering in Reshanta, they can be more readily dealt with singly. That means finding and killing them before they leave the ship.</p>

          <p>All right--to take out the weaponry, find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_Surkana_13].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_Elite]s don't answer to the ship's captain, so they'll remain a threat until you take them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If these instructions sound simple, you may not fully comprehend the danger. But don't worry, I wouldn't think of sending you in there alone. And don't forget to watch out for...</p>

          <p>Well done. Shutting down the threats aboard the Dredgion eases the load here in the Abyss. I wish that were the end of it, but the Dredgion is still a threat in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'll rebuild and send it out after us again. The Balaur just refuse to give up.</p>
