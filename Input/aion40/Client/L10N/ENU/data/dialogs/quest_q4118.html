          <p>There are a great number of ancient spirits in the Theobomos Lab. I'd very much like to know why they're different than the spirits in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you collect some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q4118a]s and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Heintz], maybe we can figure it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't know when the rift will close, so you had better collect as much Essence as you can.</p>

          <p>The entire village is concerned about the rift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos Lab. It's all anyone can talk about, and no one knows whether it's an opportunity or a risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe if we could get some more material for our researchers to study, it would calm down the village.</p>

          <p>Oh, that will definitely help. One of the puzzles our researchers have found is the difference between the spirits in the labs and those around Asmodae. Now, perhaps they can figure it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>News that we're gaining a greater understanding of the labs and the rift will help calm the village down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you. I will reward Parqusha separately later. He's doing quite a good job with this.</p>

          <p>Parqusha asked you to collect the essence of the ancient spirits, and take them to Heintz to be sent out for research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Heintz was glad, saying that news of the research would help calm the fears of the village.</p>
