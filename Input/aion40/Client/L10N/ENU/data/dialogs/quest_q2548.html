          <p>Nyerk...shopkeeper's life is hard, Daeva. Before Barosunerk can sell, Barosunerk must buy. To buy there must be Kinah, and to get Kinah Barosunerk must sell. Nyerk....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Huarinrinerk helped by sending items, but not for free. Must find Kinah to pay Huarinrinerk, must also buy more stock, must also watch the store. Too many things to do, Daeva, and too few paws!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you lend me some money? Yes, yes?</p>

          <p>In Morheim are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SouledStoneAD_35_An]s! Big, ugly, rocky, heavy, glowing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SouledStoneAD_35_An]s with valuable [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2548a]s inside, yes! Fragments that Huarinrinerk can sell for lots and lots of Kinah!</p>

          <p>Can Daeva collect fragments for me, and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF3_12]? Beluslan is cold, yes? Beluslan people would snap up warm fragments...yes?</p>
