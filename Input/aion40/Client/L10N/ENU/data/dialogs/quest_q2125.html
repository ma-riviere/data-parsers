          <p> </p> 
          <p>Derot thinks I never break the rules, but I've made stacks of Kinah on the side. If you can keep quiet, I've got a job that me and the boys need kept quiet, even from Derot and the boss.</p>

          <p>I'll be quiet, but don't worry about Derot. Believe me, he doesn't listen to a thing I say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here in Ishalgen is an [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_8], closely guarded by the Mau and farmed day and night by the Dundun. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hef], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alfrigh], and I are going to raid it and keep the plunder for ourselves. We could use a fourth body to watch our backs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you've got that cutthroat spirit in you. When I mentioned your name to the boys, none of them had any complaints.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, to cut a long story short, I'm standing here, you're standing there, and I'm offering you guaranteed plunder for a quick raid. What do you say?</p>

          <p>First, we need to tell the others you're one of us. I'll talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alfrigh]; you head back to Aldelle Village and let [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hef] know what's up. Make sure he's got the incendiary devices ready too, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One last thing: if he asks you about the weather, say "I don't care for the cold; money warms my heart." Say anything else, and he won't talk to you about the plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hurry up, [%username]. We want to get in and get out quickly.</p>

          <p>You can walk away, but if I catch word of you getting loose-lipped about this, I'll bury this blade of mine in your back when you least expect it, understand?</p>

          <p>I've got bad news, though. We can't raid the plantation tonight. I don't know whether Ulgorn caught wind of our scheme, but he's had me running around, bleeding and sweating, all day. I ain't had a chance to prepare the incendiaries for the raid. We need to wait a few days until things settle back down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do me a favor, [%username]. Tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alfrigh] that the plan has been postponed. He ain't known for his patience, and I worry that he'll charge into the plantation on his own, even if we don't show up.</p>
