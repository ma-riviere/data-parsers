          <p>Just watchin' them birds up over that ridge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wheelin' like that. Look so free an' careless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems like an easy life. Not much to think about, just gotta feed yourself and keep your young'uns safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I s'pose that's what we're tryin' to do, too, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jus' seems more complicated to us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wonder what them birds are thinkin' on.</p>
