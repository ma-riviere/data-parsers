          <p>"You should play more, make more friends, study Alchemy, paint watercolors, blah blah blah." She can't just leave me to my reading.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Aion forbid she have a friend over. Then it's "Say something in Balaur for Sineta, Rarniel," or "Recite 'The Legend's Shadow' for Sineta," or "Show Sineta that clever diagram you drew of the Dredgion."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so embarassing. Doesn't she realize how gauche it is to boast like that?</p>
