          <p>When I was a child, my grandfather told me a legend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Lord Israphel and Lady Siel were destroyed, their souls combined and were sealed inside a crystal orb, the Cataclysm Orb. Whoever found this orb would wield unimaginable power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was fascinated. Obsessed. I had to have that orb. I trained, I Ascended, I became a Spiritmaster so I would understand the Orb. I followed clues, researched tirelessly. I believed wholeheartedly in its reality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My family questioned my obsession, so I stopped writing them. Friends and comrades as well, if they dared laugh at my dream.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soon, I had no one left. But I could not find the Cataclysm Orb alone. I needed allies in my quest.</p>

          <p>I'm ashamed to admit it, but... In the Abyss, I met another who shared my obsession.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An... Elyos. I will not describe how we met, nor the long process of learning to trust each other, but our shared passion built a bridge to understanding and, eventually, respect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We researched and hunted and fought off legions of Balaur, together, to find the Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, one day, we did it. We found it. Or, we thought we had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And... it seems inevitable now, but... well, I turned on him. I didn't know I was going to do it until my knife was in his back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Cataclysm Orb? It's just a legend. And now I have nothing.</p>
