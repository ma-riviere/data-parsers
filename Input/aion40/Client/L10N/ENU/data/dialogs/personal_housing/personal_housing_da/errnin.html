          <p>This will sound strange, but I beg your patience, friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am the deposed prince of a... faraway country. You have never heard of it, I am sure. Before our government was overthrown I was entrusted with our family fortune of 15 billion Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But due to my family's fallen status, I cannot remove the money from my country's Warehouses myself. I have been delegated as a matter of trust by my family to look for an Asmodian partner to transfer the sum of 15 billion Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Trustworthy Daeva, simply for the use of your warehouse account, I would award you a portion of the sum of 15 billion Kinah. All we need is your personal information and Warehouse account number.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I crave your indulgence and confidentiality in this rare opportunity to get rich helping our... faraway country.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahem.</p>
