          <p>Oh, Doami, Doami... she's so amazing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She doesn't make it easy for me to love her, no. But I know she only ignores me to make the chase more exciting. But not much longer. I've made up my mind--I'm going to ask her to be mine!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just as soon as I get the courage... and she gets back from wherever she went. Her butler said that she'd been gone all day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She'll be back soon, though, and then she will finally fall into my arms!</p>
