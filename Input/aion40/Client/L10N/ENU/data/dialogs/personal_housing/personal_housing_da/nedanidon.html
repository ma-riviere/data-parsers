          <p>Asmodian literature has never been much of a priority in Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it's not an instructional tome or historical manuscript, it is regarded as unimportant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But how are we to grow as a people if we do not value literature?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stories are how a culture's beliefs and societal norms are spread. And it's how the future will know what matters to us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess that's less important to you Daevas, but we Humans will not live in the distant future like you will.</p>
