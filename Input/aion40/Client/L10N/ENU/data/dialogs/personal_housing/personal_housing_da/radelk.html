          <p>The weather here in Pernon is unpredictable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sun, then sudden rain. Clear, then sudden mist. Calm, then sudden wind. And then, just as suddenly, calm again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's almost certainly because of the varied landscape. Mountains, lowlands, inlets and sea--they affect wind currents and temperatures quite drastically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But despite these drastic changes, Pernon is most often temperate and mild. It's very interesting, really.</p>
