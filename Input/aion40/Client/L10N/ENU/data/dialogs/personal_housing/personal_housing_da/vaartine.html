          <p>There's this girl. She's great--she's funny, and sweet, and gorgeous. We get along well. I know she cares for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she was in love with some Human, a long time ago. Her family refused to let her marry him, and it ended in tragedy. Those things always do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's sad and all, but she could just move on! She could be happy with me, I know it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess happiness isn't as romantic as forbidden love and heartbreak.</p>
