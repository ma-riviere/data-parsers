          <p>It's been two weeks since my fiance, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Leinolz], left for the Traders' Berth at Seggurheim. He was making a delivery to the Shugos there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's usually home in three or four days, but nobody has seen him! And a trader coming the other way says he never arrived!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to find Leinolz. I couldn't wait for the Archons! I made my way this far, but I don't dare go any farther--there are so many Spriggs and Amphas.</p>
