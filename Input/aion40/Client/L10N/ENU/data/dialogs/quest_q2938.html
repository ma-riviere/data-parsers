          <p>All Asmodians are equal, but there is one place within the walls of Pandaemonium where all are not equal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple of Knowledge is open to everyone, Humans and Daevas alike...but no one may enter the Hidden Library without special permission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The books and scrolls we keep there are both valuable and delicate.</p>

          <p>Most of the people who gain access are scholars who've achieved eminence in their fields.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And sometimes those who have accomplished great things for Pandaemonium are given access as a civic honor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want access to the Hidden Library, I suggest you provide proof of your notable achievements. For example, you could ask a fortress commander for a letter of recommendation. Can you get such a letter, [%username]?</p>

          <p>That's all right. Not everyone is stirred by the thought of priceless books or ancient wisdom.</p>
