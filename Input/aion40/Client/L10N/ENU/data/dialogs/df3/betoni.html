          <p>The Observatory fell and I died trying to defend it. That should be enough. Death should be enough. I can't forget, though.... I can't let go. I lost something that day I can never get back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur have to pay for what they've done, and I have to regain my honor--if I can. I wanted to go on to the flow of Aether, but I couldn't...I couldn't leave. Not after what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Hoarfrost Mau know a lot about the Balaur, and I think that with their help I might be able to do...something. I can only hope it isn't too late.</p>

          <p>The Hoarfrost Mau are a tribe that used to serve the Balaur. They even helped the Balaur enter Beluslan. After the Balaur came, however, they slaughtered the Mau. Only a few survived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The survivors turned against their former masters and have allied with us, hoping for revenge. I believe we can use them to put an end to the Balaur. The enemy of our enemy is our friend, after all.</p>
