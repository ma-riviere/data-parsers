          <p>I decided to come here because Rubelik was recruiting a researcher.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think we may be able to make some new discoveries, since this area hasn't been well-studied.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we do, I hope to secure a foothold in academic circles and get my own research funded. For that, I'll do anything.</p>

          <p>Well, it's really Rubelik's research. We're looking at an ancient lighthouse because it may hold the secrets of the Seirens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not an area of interest for me, but I'm learning how to conduct a proper investigation and that's good experience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, if Rubelik becomes successful and famous, he'll be able to help me get patronage for my own work someday. We all have to pay our dues, right?</p>
