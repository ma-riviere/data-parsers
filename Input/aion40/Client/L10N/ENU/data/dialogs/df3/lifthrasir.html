          <p>I'm a little tired. I couldn't sleep much last night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was comparing the offerings list with the items we're required to offer to Empyrean Lords. It's such a mess but I think I've sorted things out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We just have too many documents to sort out in Beluslan Fortress. It's good that many records remain, but there are too many for me to handle.</p>
