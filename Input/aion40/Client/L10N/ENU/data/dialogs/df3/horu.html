          <p>Indeed. I'm infatuated with minerals, I have to admit, though it doesn't interfere with my duties as a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I use it to my advantage, actually. I advise Bestla what stones to use and where to put them as she restores the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't spend all day worrying about the fortress like she does, though. I do enjoy collecting minerals....</p>
