          <p>When I got back to Pandaemonium after serving in the Abyss, I thought I'd be able to get a few days of rest. Before my first day was over, though, I was sent out here to deal with the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I like and respect Gigrite and the others, and I do hope we can find a solution to all the problems here soon. But I want more than anything to just go home and relax for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To spend an entire day not having to look behind me to see what's coming--that would be glorious.</p>
