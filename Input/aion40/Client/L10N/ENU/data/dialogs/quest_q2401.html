          <p>One of the sad aspects of ascension is that immortal Daevas must watch their Human friends and family age...and die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I am developing a new serum to prolong Human life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We know that eating Tripeeds is good for your health, and I think I have finally isolated this beneficial substance.</p>

          <p>Yes! I know! But the thing is, almost no one is interested in my research!</p>

          <p>They mock me, saying that it's impossible for Humans to live long like Daevas. That it's folly to even try!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have been working on this for over a hundred years now, and I won't give up! </p>

          <p>Lies! They say nothing but lies! At this point the Fortress Commander seems to think I'm a poison specialist, just because of that one unfortunate incident. It wasn't supposed to be poisonous!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, now he wants me to prepare a batch of poison for the troops. What talk! Although...I don't think that they need much preparing....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked me to use Scolopen poison...and that really should be strong enough. If you have time...do you think you could kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ScorpionDF2_35_An]s and collect the poison? I'll be sure to reward you.</p>

          <p>Thank you. My research takes a very long time to compile. I don't know why people can't understand that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ScorpionDF2_35_An]s you should be able to get the poison from their tails.</p>

          <p>When you've gathered it, please take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Modgud] at the Halabana Hot Springs.</p>

          <p>A Daeva named Neior promised to deliver the poison, but he hasn't come yet. I fear that it will not arrive in time....</p>
