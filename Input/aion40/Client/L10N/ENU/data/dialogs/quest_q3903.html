          <p>Sorcerers and Spiritmasters generally use the same techniques as our predecessors, did you know that? Centuries of tradition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Esoteric Books of Illusion are very precious. They contain all the spells handed down in the Temple of Illusion. Charna is currently charged with keeping them safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I recently borrowed one of them. Would you be kind enough to return it for me?</p>

          <p>As I mentioned, this book has nothing new for your fertile mind. There are, however, others that contain deeper secrets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you speak with Charna about exploring such mysteries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She'd be able to quench your curiosity. Hurry along now.</p>

          <p>As we study Aether, manipulate it, shape it, and are, in turn, shaped by it, we come to realize how little control we actually have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we stop trying to direct and control the Aether, however, it joyfully answers our call and becomes pliant and supple, like an eager lover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then we find ourselves somewhere beyond matters arcane and into the very matter of Aion! Do you understand what I mean?</p>

          <p>When you think about true nature of Aether, tomes such as these Esoteric Books of Illusion barely scratch the surface.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even so, what we've managed is staggering. Imagine what we might do in another thousand years?</p>
