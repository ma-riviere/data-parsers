          <p>Ah, [%username], there you are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've come to a region undergoing a sustained and severe period of change. Eltnen was once a prosperous, radiant place, a true rival to the Cantas Coast. Now though, its woodlands are dying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been sent here because I'm one of the oldest Daevas, a general since before the Cataclysm. Don't let my youthful appearance fool you. I get the job done!</p>

          <p>Your readiness will be judged by your friends and your foes, [%username], not by you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our overall goal here is simple: to stop the desertification of Eltnen and restore the region's previous condition. This will be achieved through plenty of hard work, and as a [%userclass] you'll be required to face down and overcome a number of challenges.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are several tasks I have already assigned to you, which I suggest you start on immediately. Others may be made ready once you have shown that you can handle yourself. Faith and arms!</p>
