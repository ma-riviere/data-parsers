          <p>Daevas are pouring into the Theobomos Lab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think they're up to?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I imagine it's just curiosity. After all, it takes a lot to scare a Daeva off, thanks to their long livedness.</p>

          <p>Haha. I don't know. Maybe I just created it--like that terrible experiment in the Theobomos Lab. Unstable Triroan? Have you seen it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The monster absorbs every single bit of Aetheric energy around it, and then multiplies it exponentially. By now the lab must be about to explode!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm...I wonder if you'd be up for neutralizing this Triroan. Otherwise a raft of Daevas might be killed by their own curiosity. What do you say?</p>

          <p>If you can pull this off, I'll give you a coin. And not just any coin--Sanctum has allocated a generous amount of special coins for investigations like this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'll wait here and leave the hard work to you. Be careful in the lab!</p>

          <p>Weird. Most Daevas would die to dive into danger zone and prove their worth.</p>

          <p>Well, never mind. There are hundreds of other Daevas I can ask.</p>
