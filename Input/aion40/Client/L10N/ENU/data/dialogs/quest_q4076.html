          <p>We Asmodians are used to struggle, but farming here in Brusthonin is a challenge unlike any I've ever faced. But mark my words, Daeva--no matter what happens, my crops will grow here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They will grow here despite the contaminated soil, the pervasive undead, the rampaging beasts...all the hardships.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You Daevas know warfare and magic, but for farming...I think you need a Human like me.</p>

          <p>Well, on an Undead-cleansing mission at Havenjark Farm, I saw a scarecrow called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Scarecrow_Virhu], standing sentinel in his field, patiently waiting for his master.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He'd lost almost all his straw over the centuries since the Cataclysm. No complaints, working away no matter what--the Asmodian ideal, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wanted to help out my fellow Asmodian with some stuffing, but we had to be in camp by dark. [%username], will you help me?</p>
