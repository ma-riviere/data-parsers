          <p>I've studied just about every kind of creature, but I've never seen anything like this. Their power of regeneration is incredible!</p>

          <p>If we don't do something soon the whole jungle will be filled with Klaws. No, the whole world!</p>

          <p>There's not a moment to lose! Go to out there right away and start destroying [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_NeutSpawner_Q1548]s. As many as you can. We've got to slow them down! I'll send an emergency request for reinforcements to Brigade General Perento.</p>

          <p>Try to crush 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_NeutSpawner_Q1548]s and then come back to me to check in. I'll have a reply from the fortress by then I hope. Once we know what help we can expect from the Fortress we can talk about the next step.</p>
