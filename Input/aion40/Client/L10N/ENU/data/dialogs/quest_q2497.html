          <p>Oh, it is terrible! Worst of all, when I kicked my fishing tool box, it fell into the water! I looked in the water for it, but didn't see it. Maybe it was swept away by the current. </p>

          <p>My [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_ToolBox_Q2497] contains [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2497a], which I need. The trouble is...well, I can't swim.</p>
