          <p>Back when the Cataclysm shook Atreia, this fortress was falling apart like everything else. It would've crushed everyone in it, if it weren't for one thing--the Artifact of Time and Space.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fate decreed that the Artifact was being studied right here. They didn't know everything it was capable of, but they knew it could stop time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So they stopped time for the fortress. No more time, no more falling.</p>

          <p>It did then, but just last week a big chunk fell down and crushed one of the Humans here. Nasty scene.</p>

          <p>We called in [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bestla], a Daeva of Architecture, to fix the problem, but she's been telling me she needs an assistant. Someone with top-flight skills.</p>
