          <p>It is true! During the Cataclysm the Tower of Eternity shattered into fragments, leaving only two broken stumps behind. A great disharmonious resonance began to flow between the stumps, and that is where the Abyss was created.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The flow of energy is so unstable that the Abyss itself is not a stable space.</p>

          <p>Not quite correct. The Cataclysm occurred only after the Aetheric Field was lifted by the Seraphim Lords to allow the Balaur access to the Tower in a foolish bid for peace. It is true that the Aetheric Field has weakened since then, but the Aetheric Field and the Abyss are not related.</p>

          <p>No. It is true that the Abyss was created as the Tower of Eternity shattered, but the fragments of the Tower have not diminished in size since the Cataclysm.</p>

          <p>That's right! The Abyss is very unstable, and Aether is rapidly running out like water pouring through a crack in a dam.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the Abyss is drawing Aether away from Atreia itself. If the Aether was exhausted, it could destroy all life. To stop it, we must defeat the Elyos and destroy their half of the tower.</p>

          <p>No. The Elyos Temple Legion is indeed led by Lord Nezekan, but they were dispatched on a mission of vengeance following the utter defeat of the Legion that first trespassed here in Asmodae.</p>

          <p>High Priest Balder told me to expect you, [%username]. My questions concern the optimal strategies for fighting in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let us begin. We secure control over the Abyss by capturing the Fortresses in Reshanta.</p>

          <p>Destroying the castle gate is important, true. You cannot enter a fortress until the gate is broken down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that is the first step, not the last. A fortress whose gate is destroyed is not captured, only breached.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>It is certainly easier to infiltrate a fortress if the Aetheric Field generator is destroyed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, infiltration and capture are very different. If you're called on to lead an attack against a Fortress, ignorance could cost lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think it over. How do you capture a fortress?</p>

          <p>Correct! You have to defeat the guardian entity in order to capture a fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a lot easier said than done. Guardian entities typically lurk deep underground, far beneath the fortress. Once you overcome the guardian, the fortress is yours to control.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Incorrect, [%username]. Artifacts used to be devices inside the Tower of Eternity, but they were scattered across our lands in the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think it over once again. Which of these statements concerning Artifacts is false?</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>That statement is true. Every Artifact has a protector. Overcoming the protector is the only known method for capturing an Artifact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think it over. Which of these statements concerning the Artifacts is false?</p>

          <p>Artifacts are often found near the fortresses, and controlling the fortress may give you a tactical advantage, but controlling the fortress guarantees nothing.</p>
