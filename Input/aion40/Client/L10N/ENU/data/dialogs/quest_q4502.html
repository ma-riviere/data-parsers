          <p>Heimdall probably mentioned it, but your first order of business is finding Brigade General Anuhart. He has something you need--something called the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_4502a].</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>And although we know the Anuhart Legion invades Poeta in the future, we don't know where [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_H_DrakanFiName_50_Ah] will be when you arrive there. It's possible he won't be in Dark Poeta at all.</p>
