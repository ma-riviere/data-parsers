          <p>I'm sending you to investigate. You'll have the best luck searching dead bodies, so be sure to make some. Head over to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA23], defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA151]s and see if you can't find some evidence of this supposed conspiracy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Considering the Krall command hierarchy, the Sentinel Leaders would be most likely to have the evidence we need.</p>

          <p>You're going to need allies for this. Hunting alone will get you killed, and I have enough dead heroes on my conscience already.</p>

          <p>To convince Sanctum to send him reinforcements, Spatalos was forced to take the suggestion of a Krall conspiracy seriously.</p>
