          <p>Welcome, Daeva! You could hardly have come at a better time. I've uncovered some disturbing hints of what the Asmodians plan to do with Miren Fortress. If they succeed, Elyos may suffer unrecoverable harm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Gray Wind Legionaries have sworn to stop their assault and re-take the fortress. I think after you hear about this, you'll be inclined to join us.</p>

          <p>That's fair. A great Asmodian war-host is gathering at Miren, led by their elite troops. An assault is imminent, but there's more. Their supply deliveries have been unusually secretive, so I sent an assassin into their warehouse. She found crate after crate of kisks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've not worked with one, a kisk is a portable obelisk. They allow whole squads of soldiers to resurrect wherever they're placed. In the fortress, on the field...even on Elyos soil!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not the worst of it. Yesterday, my spy reported that the kisks were being handed out to the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1816_all], who were then assigned squads of ordinary troops. Ariel's bloody wings, [%username], they plan to drive deep into our heart, and to stay there and twist the knife! This must be stopped!</p>

          <p>Excellent. Now, while the Asmodians occupy the fortress they think they're safe. As soon as the fortress switches to the vulnerable state, you and my other commandos will strike.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill as many of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1816_all] as you can and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1816a]s for me. Do you understand?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a risky mission, but we must deprive them of those kisks, or we'll be fighting Asmodians in the streets of Sanctum next! Attack swiftly, silently and often.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1816_all] killed my spy and hung her from the wall.</p>

          <p>Killing a few soldiers or taking just a few kisks is not enough! We must break the back of their offensive! Understand?</p>
          <p>Go back and make sure you get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1816a]s. And hurry! Kisks mean that those you killed will be resurrecting even now!</p>

          <p>Oh, thank Aion! There's no way they can hold the fortress now, much less mount an offensive. Excellent work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And soon the Gray Wind will blow through Miren and cleanse it of Asmodians entirely. I wonder what those fools thought when they resurrected back at home, far from Miren?</p>

          <p>Tired? Rest, then. You deserve it. You have safeguarded Sanctum's glory today!</p>

          <p>Minerva uncovered a plot by the Asmodians to infiltrate their armies deep inside Elyos territory using kisks to resurrect soldiers on the front line. Desperate to stop this, she asked your help.</p>
