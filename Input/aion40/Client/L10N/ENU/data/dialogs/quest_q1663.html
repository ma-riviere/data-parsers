          <p>I'm certain that the Krall are up to something more than their usual chest-pounding, shouting, and running around like fools.</p>

          <p>Our little Daeva of Zephyr over there informed me she's seen their High Shaman doing something suspicious around the Odium Refinery.</p>

          <p>You're quite right. It'd be far too great a pain to incapacitate that stinking brute, drag him back here, then find someone who speaks his barbaric tongue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We ought to just kill him and search his corpse for anything of interest.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallShaKNMPurify_39_Ae_Tune] is no doubt surrounded by many guards, so you'll want to muster a band of allies before you strike out.</p>
