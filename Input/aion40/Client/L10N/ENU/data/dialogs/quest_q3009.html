          <p>I've thought it over. I still want Kelaino, but we can split the bounty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've tracked him all the way from Sanctum, through Poeta and Verteron. I've earned that blasted money.</p>

          <p>Revenge Valley's brutal, though! I wouldn't chance it, so I doubt Kelaino made it fifty feet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've heard of you. You're a blasted monster! So here's the deal.</p>

          <p>Great! Head southwest from here, around that bluff to the north. Head through Meniherk's First Excavation Site, then straight west.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3009a] off his body. They want it as part of the bounty. Oh, and locals say those Viragos are transformed people. I don't know about that, but they do pick over corpses.</p>

          <p>If you can't find him, roast some birds. It'll turn up.</p>
