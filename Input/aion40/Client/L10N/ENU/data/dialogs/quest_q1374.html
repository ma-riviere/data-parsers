          <p>The contents are very sensitive...but I know I can trust you, [%username]. It's a report on the activities of the Viragos and the Lepharist Revolutionaries up on Kuriullu Mountain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been asked to keep them under constant surveillance and report everything they do, since they seem to be up to some sort of nefarious plot. We're already stretched thin, watching over Agairon Village, and now we have to spy on the Viragos and the Lepharists. Things are getting worse and worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please keep this an absolute secret. The villagers may panic if they find out.</p>
