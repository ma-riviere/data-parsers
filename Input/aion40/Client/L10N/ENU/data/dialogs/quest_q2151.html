          <p>It's really all I want. Nothing's been quite the same since I left, but it's just too humiliating to have to grovel.</p>

          <p>...Huh. Wow, I just really proved his point, didn't I? Ugh, fine. I know I've got a lot of growing up to do, and grown-ups know how to apologize, and blah blah blah. If it means I can have things go back to normal, I guess I'll go and see him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't go and tell him, or anything. I need to work up my nerve.</p>
