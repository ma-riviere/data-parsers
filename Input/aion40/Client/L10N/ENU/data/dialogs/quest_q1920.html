          <p>It seems only yesterday that I conducted your ceremony, and yet here I am, just about to send you to the very linchpin of our war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have kept tabs on your progress, and the moment has come to test your mettle one final time.</p>

          <p>Such modesty. Your worth has already been proven a hundred times over, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...the Abyss is a terrifying and innately hostile world--a void filled with cruel beasts that ably demonstrate their speed, strength, intelligence, and co-operation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ours is the righteous path. We are Aion's chosen, but there is still this final test we must endure before we truly deserve our paradise. Do you understand?</p>

          <p>The test you are about to take judges your physical prowess. You will battle your ascended brothers and sisters.</p>

          <p>Head to the Coliseum, and speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rinos]. He will give you further instruction. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>There's only one way to impress me--martial prowess. You may be used to knocking back the odd Dukaki warrior, but they're nothing next to a Balaur.</p>
