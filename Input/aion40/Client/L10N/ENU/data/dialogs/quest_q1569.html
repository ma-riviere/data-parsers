	        <p> </p>
	        <p>I talk to many Sorcerers, Spiritmasters, Clerics, and Chanters when they come to collect coin rewards. I love talking to Daevas. They travel so much and do such interesting things.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>Did you bring silver coins for me? The more coins you bring, the better items I can give you.</p>

	        <p>Well! For thirty two silver coins I have some very nice rewards.</p>

	        <p>I'm happy to talk to all Daevas, but I don't have coin rewards for [%userclass]s. If that's what you're after, you should talk to Lomulias.</p>

	        <p>Thanks for chatting with me, even if for just a little while.</p>

	        <p>Oh, [%username]! Tell me all about the places you've been! Are any of them nicer than Arbolu's Haven? Is Eltnen as bad as they say? How is the Abyss war progressing?</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>Come back and talk to me anytime! But if you collect sixteen or thirty-two silver coins first, I'll be able to give you a reward item.</p>
