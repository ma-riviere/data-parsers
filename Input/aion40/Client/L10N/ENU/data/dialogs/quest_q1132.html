          <p>He wrung his paws and wailed about how long I was taking to make the armor he ordered, right?</p>

          <p>Exactly. Cheap materials, higher profit. And these materials have been getting worse and worse. Sagirunerk claims they're sourced locally, but they're not. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everything round here is saturated with Aether. Genuine Verteron Starcrabs have a gleam to their shells. The ones Gaurinerk sent are dirty yellow...like diseased bone. See?</p>

         <p>In that case, [%userclass], would you help me out?</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>I need to show the Centurion what Sagirunerk's been up to. If you collect quality materials from hereabouts for me, we can compare them with Gaurinerk's junk.</p>
         <p> </p>          
         <p>Would you please gather [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA74]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA75]s, and show them to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA18] along with these samples of Sagirunerk's materials? I'd go myself, but I'm just a trader and you're a Daeva. Let's be honest...you have the better chance of being heard.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA140]s near the entrance to the citadel, and plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA16_1]s down at the water's edge.</p>

          <p>Please gather [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA74]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA75]s, and bring them to the Centurion. When he compares them with the materials Sagirunerk gave me, he'll understand the situation. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't want to be in Sagirunerk's shoes after that. Wait...do Shugos wear shoes?</p>

          <p>Unbelievable! Sagirunerk wanted Nadaelo to armor my Guardians with this muck? I wouldn't line a Pluma cage with it!</p>
