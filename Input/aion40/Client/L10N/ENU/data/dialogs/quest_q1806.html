          <p>Of course we can't let the Asmodians continue to occupy it, and my research depends on the fortress being in Elyos hands.</p>

          <p>Listen carefully--Sulfur Fortress is currently home to the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1806_all]. You'll encounter many different kinds of elite Asmodians. Kill all of them you can.</p>
