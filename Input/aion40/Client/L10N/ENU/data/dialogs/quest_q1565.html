          <p>I'm sure you know that Daevas of Zephyr are dispatched to Heiron to gather information on the Balaur and the undead. We need intelligence on the Balaur to aid our fight in the Abyss. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Other Daevas, like myself, investigate undead...attempting to fathom the source of the contamination. Most importantly we return lost souls to the flow of Aether.</p>

          <p>I'm in charge of the whole area, but this place is so sharding huge I can't oversea every detail. My superiors don't accept excuses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So. I want to ask you this. Would you go to Orton Farm and destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Banshee_37_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Bookie_37_An]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their numbers have increased and I have no time or people to handle them.</p>
