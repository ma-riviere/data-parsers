          <p>Some Daevas are possessed by the illusion that they are somehow immune to the misfortunes that befall others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They witness their fellow fighters returning from the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1469_Zone] with grievous wounds, but that doesn't keep them from entering the Temple themselves--where they're wounded. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some call it bravery or bravado. I call it pathetic, and I say it must end.</p>

          <p>The only reason they keep flocking to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1469_Zone] is for a shot at Judge Kromede.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can get in there and eliminate her once and for all, perhaps other Daevas will stop their endless migrations.</p>

          <p>I know it's a lot to ask as the Temple is full of dangers, but it must be done. Will you try?</p>
