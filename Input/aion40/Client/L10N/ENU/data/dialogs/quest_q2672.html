          <p>I found some strange eggs. I've never heard of the Balaur laying eggs before, and it's not really something I like to think about.</p>

          <p>Whatever's going to hatch from them, though, it can't be good. Could you help me take care of them?</p>

          <p>Just drop them off here. The next time you're in the Fortress, could you tell somebody to come pick up the eggs so they can take them back and study them?</p>
