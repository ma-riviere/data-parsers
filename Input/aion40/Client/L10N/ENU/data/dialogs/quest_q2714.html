		<p>Azphelumbra [%username], I've heard of your prowess in battle.</p>

		<p>Others should go to Ivaldi for rewards.</p>

		<p>I was right! 16 silver coins.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>You know, some fight for the rewards,  others are full of patriotic ardor for Asmodae. There are even some who fight just because they like to fight.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>No matter what their goals or reasons, all contribute to the victory of Pandaemonium.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>On behalf of Lord Azphel, congratulations on your extraordinary achievements!</p>

		<p>32 silver coins represents excellent work and dedication. Your reputation wasn't exaggerated at all.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Many Daevas show up with a handful of silver coins, but only Asmodae's greatest collect 32. We always have special rewards available for those Daevas who do their best.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Take this reward with the thanks of all Asmodians.</p>

		<p>I'm sorry, [%username], Pandaemonium has strict rules.</p>

		<p>I can only reward you if you bring me 16 or 32 silver coins.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But a Daeva like you can get more in no time at all!</p>
