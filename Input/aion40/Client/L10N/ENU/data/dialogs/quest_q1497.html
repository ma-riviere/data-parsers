          <p>Getting rid of the Mamaki Kobolds has given us some breathing space, but the Kaidan Krall remain a thorn in our side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to think that the ones at the Kaidan Mine were little threat, since all they do is dig for ore. I thought of them as mostly harmless. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it seems I was wrong. They've been abducting people, and they're mining Odium.</p>

          <p>I agree. We can't do anything about the Kaidan Headquarters, but we can drive them out of the Kaidan Mine, at least. To do that we need to weaken them by eliminating their main fighters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not going to be easy. Even so, I think you can handle it, [%username]. You are...exceptional. </p>

          <p>You are indeed a hero, [%username]. Please go to the Kaidan Mine and eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallScoutHK_28_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ReC_KrallRangerK_29_Ae]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should take some allies with you. The Krall are no pushovers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime, I'll be praying for you to return safely.</p>

          <p>When the Balaur disappeared from the face of Atreia after the Catalcysm, I thought we wouldn't need to fight the Krall anymore.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I know it was a difficult mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've weakened the enemy, [%username]. If we can continue to cut down the numbers of Veteran Scouts and Elite Sentinels, it will be a great blow to the Krall.</p>
