          <p>Not like your skin, Daeva. You must put strong effort into your appearance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh? It is natural? You are so lucky...like Andu. His milk-white skin, shapely nose, shimmering eyes.... The glimpse of shining teeth when he smiles.... Beautiful! Mesmerizing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, Senarinrinerk excited to bring [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Andu] order of jewel powder. He sounded urgent, but how to do? Senarinrinerk too busy for making delivery today. Would you help Senarinrinerk and also see Andu with own eyes?</p>
