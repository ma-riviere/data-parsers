          <p>Heiron is now crawling with the Balaur and the Undead, but it once was a beautiful and prosperous land.</p>

          <p>You wouldn't know it today.</p>

          <p>Medeus Manor and Orton Farm used to sit on a vast expanse of farmland that fed half of the people of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the denizens were massacred by the Kishar Krall during the Krall War. It was over before reinforcements could arrive. Since then, land has remained barren.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the Undead appeared. The villagers believe those murdered in the Krall War have risen again.</p>

          <p>The villagers have no one to deal with them because of the Balaur. Also, we're here to defend the Observatory. We can't leave our posts.</p>
