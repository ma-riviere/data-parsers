          <p>Excellent progress, [%username]. You remind me of another young Daeva who learned the secrets of alchemy with unusual felicity. A great many were jealous of his quick success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did he deflect their spite and ascend to the position of Master of Alchemy? By hard work, and honest sweat!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter how well you're doing, don't rest content. Keep at it. Keep striving for more.</p>

          <p>Marvelous. Here, take this. I bound the spellbook up with a cord, so you could carry it more easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fraiban is in the Primum Landing. You can't miss him.</p>

          <p>To be honest, I can't blame Pandaemonium. They've kept up the deliveries, right enough. It's just that I can't keep anything in stock. As soon as anything arrives, it's snapped up.</p>
