          <p>Well, we've got to begin somewhere, so we may as well begin somewhere small. All the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_BrokenRocks_Q2503]s lying on the ground have to be cleaned up.</p>

          <p>Whatever the ancient Atreians made this fortress out of, it's hard and sharp. Just brushing against one of those things could give you a nasty cut.</p>
