          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. Is this your first Mortality Festival?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish it were under better circumstances. This year's festival may lack a lot of the punch of last year's.</p>

          <p>Well, it's the paper kites! The whole festival revolves around them. The children learn about the fragility of life through the fragile kites.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they're all tattered and broken this year, and then someone stole our [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A]s, which is how we repair them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A], we have no useable kites. And without kites, we can't hold the festival. Can you...?</p>

        	<p>It may seem a bit grim to some, but the Mortality Festival really does teach important lessons to the kids.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They learn to appreciate the time they have, and to make the most of every moment. And there's plenty of fun to be had too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you been to Haramel, Nochsana Training Camp, Kromede's Trial, the Fire Temple, Steel Rake, or Dark Poeta recently? You might have some Paper Scales in your Cube, if you have.</p>
