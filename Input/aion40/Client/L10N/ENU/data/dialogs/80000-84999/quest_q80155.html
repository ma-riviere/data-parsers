          <p>Well, I should have known what would work on the riff-raff wouldn't work on you. Oh, I know who you are, and you're a cut above.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is, I used to do this thing straight-up, just talk to people like I'm talking to you now, but they always seemed to think that real power came cloaked in all this, you know, extra stuff. Mysticism and whatnot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's really quite simple. I just need a token, a tiny little thing really, and I can help you. You up for it?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a certain amount of... shall we say 'influence'?... with certain powerful parties who can guide your fate in favorable directions, and I need a token of one of your successes.</p>

          <p>No? Not willing to part with a little nothingy trinket in return for real power? Or is it more that you're unwilling to undertake the challenge required to get it?</p>

          <p>I know I said it was a small trinket, but it has to actually be the thing I described. You can do that, can't you? Just up to the seventh stage of the Empyrean Crucible. You don't even have to complete the whole thing.</p>
