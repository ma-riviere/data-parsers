          <p>Mommy went away a long time ago, but my daddy looked after me, and we did everything together! We didn't have a house any more, but it was an adventure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hunting, and picking up plants and things. Sometimes he would look for a Rift because you could always get more kinah for things you got from the Elyos side.</p>

          <p>Yeah. There was a weird looking Rift in Altgard, and we went to look at it. I said it was scary, but daddy told me he had to at least try.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He got close, and suddenly--poof! I don't think he even touched the Rift at all! I think there were other Daevas who got poofed as well, because the Brigade General said strong Daevas should kill monsters near that strange Rift and get back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80142b]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80142c] from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're a strong Daeva. Will you go and look for my daddy?</p>

          <p>You see that over there? That's the place. I heard some people calling it the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Event_Rift_Potal] and saying it's full of Elyos monsters! Scary.</p>
