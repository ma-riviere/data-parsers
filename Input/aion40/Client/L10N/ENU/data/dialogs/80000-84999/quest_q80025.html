          <p>Huh. You look pretty well-fed, there. Ever considered sharing the wealth?</p>

          <p>Makes me sick to see people stuffing their faces every New Year, while others go hungry.</p>

          <p>Really? Well, maybe you don't know what it's like growing up wondering where your next meal is coming from, or you wouldn't be standing here chatting right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>I'm in a real crisis this year, and nobody wants to help. I was trying to put together some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_NEWYEAR_01A]es, but the wagon was attacked by monsters. Any chance you'll help me out?</p>

          <p>Well, that's just...wait. You said yes? I really didn't think you'd agree to it. You're the first person who's seemed to give a gumi's tail about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, in that case, I'm gonna need 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_FOOD_NEWYEAR_3STATS]s, 5 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_POTION_HP_MP_40A] and 5 bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A] for a basic lunch box.</p>
