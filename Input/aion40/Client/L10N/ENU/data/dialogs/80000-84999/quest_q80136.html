          <p>I wish mommy would come back. There was a Rift, and it eated her! She goes through them all the time but this time she didn't come back and it's been weeks and days and months!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She wouldn't leave me alone on purpose, she wouldn't!</p>

          <p>Mommy looks after me now that the Balaurs took my daddy and our cottage away. She hunts the animals and makes them into dinner. It sounds scary but she teaches me and it's an adventure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes she goes through the Rifts and finds things in Asmodae because people pay more kinah for them! I don't like when she goes away but I like when she comes back and we have nice things to eat and one time she got me new shoes.</p>

          <p>Yeah, it was in Eltnen. But it wasn't a normal one though, it was all weird looking. She thought maybe it would have extra special stuff on the other side so it was worth a risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She didn't even go through it, she just got close and then I couldn't see her any more! I ran up but a Daeva stopped me because his friend went too and now he wasn't there any more. He says the Brigade General is telling people to kill monsters nearby and find some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80136b]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80136c] so we know what happened to the Daevas who went away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you go and do that maybe you can find my mommy?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Look! Over there! You can see it because of all the Asmodian monsters around it. Maybe that means it does go to Asmodae after all? I don't know.</p>

          <p>No. She isn't gone. She's coming back any time now. This blood on the box is monster blood. It has to be!</p>
