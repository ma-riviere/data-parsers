          <p>[%username], does the sound of battle still thrill your soul? Do you still rush towards the fight while others flee?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva like yourself, renowned among the [%userclass]s, ought to have appropriate armor. I believe I have just the thing for you.</p>

          <p>Do you remember your Daevanion armor, [%username]? The pride you felt to wear that first piece, and the lengths that were required to get the others?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've just received a new kind of Durable Daevanion armor, and I'd like you to be one of the first to wear it. All I need from you is ten [%dic:STR_DIC_DC_relic_armor_30]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why Divine Lamps? Let's just say that's a part of the fitting process that I have to be concerned about, not you. What say you?</p>
