          <p>The Pumpkin King? Oh, Tali's no one special. Just an old acquaintance. He thinks he's got the whole region locked up...but I'll show him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...I'll show him my vision, if only I can get enough power to see it clearly. Though I fear that he might be behind the horrors I'm seeing. Yes...I think that is a strong possibility....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Help me get my Soul Crystals back from his minions. Then I will be able to clear this all up.</p>
