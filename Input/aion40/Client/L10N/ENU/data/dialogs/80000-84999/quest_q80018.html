          <p>Ohhh, I was really hoping you wouldn't say that!</p>

          <p>The very first year they let me help with Solorius, and I go and lose [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80018a]s! Well, actually, I didn't so much lose them as they disappeared. But either way, they'll never let me do this again if I don't get them back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you please find those socks for me?</p>

          <p>Goody goody! I've been waiting for years to do this, and I'd hate people to think I'm irresponsible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think a good place to start looking for the socks is with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_XmasEvent_Rudolph_99_n]s. They have some kind of weird sock fascination or something! Either that or they just can't stand festivals. Anyway, they dress up like Rangidax and do their sneaky sock-stealing thing.</p>
