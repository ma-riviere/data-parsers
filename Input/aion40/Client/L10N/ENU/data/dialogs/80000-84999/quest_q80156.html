          <p>I didn't mean to give you my bog-standard patter; I know you have a better daru-dung meter than most who come through here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do have a genuine offer, though. Most people want a bit of showmanship to go with it, but in truth it's simple enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You give me a token of one of your successes, and I'll make sure fortune smiles on you soon. Sound good?</p>

          <p>Not just any token, though. It has to be a Crucible Mark you get from surviving the second stage of the Crucible Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just one tiny little mark. Might not look like much, but the most powerful charms rely on the simplest of foci.</p>
