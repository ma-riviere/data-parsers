          <p>The Charm Cards might curse you, true, but what's a life worth when the life's not lived, eh? And those that do well out of the charm cards...well...I won't spoil the surprise.</p>

          <p>Not that I'm guaranteeing a charmed outcome, of course! For some to excel, others must first establish, and occupy, the benchmark.</p>
