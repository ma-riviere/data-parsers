          <p>Welcome to Daru Days! I'm here to remind all Asmodians just how big a role Darus play in our daily lives!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fun Daru fact: a Daru mating ritual involves standing on their heads for five hours! It's true!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish fewer Asmodians took Darus for granted. Fixing that is the ultimate goal of Daru Days!</p>

          <p>It really is fun! For example, feeding them takes more skill than you might think. They have specific needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They love to eat [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_HP_MP_40A]s and drink [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get those from the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_01A]s that monsters carry! It might be a good Daru education for you!</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>
