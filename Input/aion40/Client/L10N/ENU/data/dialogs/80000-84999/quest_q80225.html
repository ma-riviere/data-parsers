          <p>The Blessing of the Empyrean Lords radiates from you. I sense that you've gained a lot of strength since coming to Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was on my way to meet the High Priest when I heard that you were coming, so I decided to wait for you. It was vital for me to give you this mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, we've been having a lot of problems with pirates lately.</p>

          <p>The Shulack pirates have been looting, kidnapping, and committing all sorts of crimes in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But their ship was damaged in their last raid and is anchored near Asmodae while they attempt repairs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is our chance to eliminate the pirates and rescue our kidnapped allies. We need someone brave to lead the assault. Like you, [%username].</p>
