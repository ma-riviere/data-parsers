          <p>She's coming from the countryside to visit me. She should at least be through [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_3] by now.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>I hope you find her soon. She always says she can take care of herself, but I worry sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if she hasn't gotten to Moslan Forest yet, then killing a few Karnifs will help her get here faster.</p>
