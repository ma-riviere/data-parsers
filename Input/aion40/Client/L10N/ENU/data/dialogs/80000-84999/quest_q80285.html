          <p>Welcome to the Beer Festival, Daeva. Er, at least, the site of the Beer Festival if we had any beer, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Were doing so well! Had decorations and everything. And of course, the beer. But then got to festival storage and found beer had gone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's witch, I tell you!</p>

          <p>No, silly--witch. As in Witchta, curse of Harvest Revel celebration. As in, worked magic to disappear beer!</p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>Well, she is not only magic-worker around here. Octobrunerk invited three finest brewmasters to work theirs, and maybe we will have enough beer to keep this festival afloat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still one thing that could use Daeva's help, though. You want to save Beer Festival, yes?</p>

          <p>Oh wonderful! Daeva will not regret this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring Fresh Barley, give to Octobrunerk to dry, and stockpile Dried Barley in time for beer festival. Will soon be Beer O'Clock everywhere!</p>

          <p>Not interested in helping? Does Daeva not like beer, or just not like fun?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wine Festival is long time away, and Napanerk kind of snooty. Daeva will regret missing Beer Festival.</p>

          <p>So exciting to find out who will make best beer. Different brewers, but same ingredients!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just hope I have enough barley for all three, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it, Daeva? Did you find the barley I asked for?</p>

          <p>Hmm. Good color, good smell, yes! Exactly what I was looking for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now just needs a quick drying out before giving to brewers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you Daeva. Take Dried Barley, collect Dried Barley, give to brewmaster you think will win first prize. Investing in brewmaster will result in good rewards later!</p>
