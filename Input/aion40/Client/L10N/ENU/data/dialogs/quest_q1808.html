          <p>Your timing is excellent.</p>

          <p>You must have heard that we lost the Asteria Fortress to the Asmodians.</p>

          <p>If we'd had just a few more troops, it never.... Well, there's no sense in looking backwards, right?</p>

          <p>Very true. We must not let past failures hold us back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, we are planning to recapture the fortress, and the first step is to wipe out the elite garrison the Asmodians have stationed there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those troops are the backbone of the resistance. If they were defeated, the remaining Asmodians would be easy prey for our assault.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to hear it. First, you need to make your move when the Asmodians are occupying the fortress, the fortress is in the Vulnerable State, and there is a battle in progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd recommend bringing a few allies as well. The Asmodians will not come at you just one at a time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, obliterate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1808_all]s and return with the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1808a]s.</p>
