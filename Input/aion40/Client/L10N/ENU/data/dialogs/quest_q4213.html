          <p>The Black Cloud Traders are silver-tongued when dealing for my business, but stark and cold when it comes to accepting any responsibility.</p>

          <p>The sun-cursed pirates who attacked the ship were [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDShip_CalydonAs_44_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDShip_CalydonMage_44_Ae]s off of the Steel Rake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had to spread the Kinah about pretty liberally to get the Shugos to talk about the pirates. I'd like my money's worth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Four dead pirates for every box they destroyed seems fair. I almost wish I'd lost more than two crates.</p>
