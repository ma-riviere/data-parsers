          <p>Your footprints are new to this region, yet already you've made a name for yourself. Few mercenaries are called to service; indeed I fear you will have to prove yourself many times over before some of the more cynical Daevas embrace you as one of us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There will be ample opportunity for that, I'm sure. These are dangerous times--our lands are threatened from all sides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even from above. Look up, [%username].</p>

          <p>This Abyss Gateway is under our control--or at least as much as something like that can be. It helps us track the movements of both Balaur and Asmodian forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, many people have been injured by fragments that fall from the Abyss.</p>

          <p>I'm glad you asked. We don't have enough Guardians on hand to deal with the fragments ourselves, and this will be a good test of your abilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seek out Guardian [%dic:STR_DIC_LA147]. He's kept watch over the gateway since its construction. He's almost part of the furniture now!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>No need to be afraid, [%username]. Just remember to keep an eye on your flight stamina, and head for solid ground the moment you start to feel tired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Flight is integral to everything we do, Daeva. Soon it will become second nature, and you will fly as gracefully as a bird.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, get to it, then. Those fragments need to be destroyed before they lose their Aetheric energies and plunge to the ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And make sure you rest every now and then. I'm not fond of irony--I'd prefer it if you didn't fall on some poor unsuspecting Shugos.</p>
