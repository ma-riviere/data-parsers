          <p>Ulaguru, you...you brute! I've looked after him well, fed him and protected him when others have tried to cause him suffering, and how does he repay...hang on, he said "idiot?" Are you sure?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I spoke to a Shugo about the Krallic language before, and he said their language doesn't have insults.</p>

          <p>Allow me to thank you, then. The test was a success, and you haven't noticed any adverse side effects, so I can take the formula to be mass produced! You have no idea how long I have waited for this moment, [%username]...no idea.</p>

          <p>Strange. Perhaps the potion still isn't quite right. You see, I deliberately cut Ulaguru's rations a few days ago, thinking he'd complain of hunger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The potion may have adversely affected your hearing, [%username]. Please accept my apologies. The side effects will probably wear off in a few hours. I do hope you aren't angry with me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this as a token of my appreciation. It's the least I could offer, especially considering you were the only one with the courage to volunteer for my little project!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Now take this, and get out of here! I'll not waste any more of my breath explaining or justifying my work to you. Go! Leave!</p>
