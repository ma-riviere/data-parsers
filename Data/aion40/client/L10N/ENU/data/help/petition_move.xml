		<question>Character Stuck</question>
		<answer>Normal playing is impossible because the character is trapped in a specific area and cannot move, or the character is moved to the same coordinate repeatedly (rubber-banding). Try returning to the obelisk using the Return skill, or press the space bar to jump. If jumping or using the Return skill does not solve the problem, then enter the chat command “/EmergencyReturn” or use the emergency return function to get out.</answer>
