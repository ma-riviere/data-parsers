          <p>Black Cloud Traders sent envoy Kuruminerk to Sanctum because new ways are needed to meet goals now, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First goal--defeat Steel Rake Pirates, nyerk nyerk. Nasty, nasty Shulacks have cost Black Cloud many Kinah. Many Shugos, too, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Steel Rake hard to catch, but now she is adrift in Abyss! Golden opportunity! Akakakakak!</p>

          <p>Kuruminerk has Secret Stigma Skill Book here in own paws. Does Daeva think Miriya wants to know about existence of such a valuable book?</p>

          <p>Kuruminerk would be happy to give Skill Book to Miriya, but this creates problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Book is quite rare and valuable. If Kuruminerk gives it to Miriya, Miriya will be burdened with owing Kuruminerk a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, will Daeva please ask Miriya about interest in Secret Stigma Skill Book? How much book is worth to her?</p>

          <p>Secret Stigma Skill Book?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I know that book very well. Some copies turned up a few years ago--full of fakery. The con man who wrote it made a fortune, then ran off. He's still wanted, I believe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose Kuruminerk thinks what he has is a real secret skill book. Just tell him...tell him I already have one. It's very nice.</p>

          <p>When you told Miriya, she said the book was a forgery, but said not to tell the Shugo that. Instead, she asked you to tell him she already has one, and it's very nice.</p>
