          <p>The Fang Trolls don't appear to be going anywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My idea of getting them to relocate by destroying their houses was apparently not the greatest one I've ever had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only have they not moved, but apparently homeless trolls are attacking Mau and Humans now.</p>

          <p>If they weren't so abysmally stupid, the blasted trolls would have taken the hint and left us their village to use as a strategic outpost.</p>
