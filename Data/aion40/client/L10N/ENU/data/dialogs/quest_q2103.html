          <p>Very good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Normally, the Spriggs are just a nuisance. But it seems their nerve grows as their numbers do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They aren't exactly a challenge for Ulgorn Raiders like us, but that doesn't mean we can afford to ignore them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you're here, I believe Vanar needs help with a job or two.</p>
