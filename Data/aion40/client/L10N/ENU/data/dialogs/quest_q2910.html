          <p>Well, I hate to admit it, but I've made a mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too many orders taken on...and though we've completed them all, we're now out of Thin Leather. There's not enough to make a belt. Not a thong. Not even a bootlace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I'm supposed to be making a very special commission...to be offered up in tribute to the five Shedim Lords themselves.</p>

          <p>I'd be very grateful if you could help me, [%username]. Many hands make light work, as the saying goes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Normally, I can rely on hunters to provide leather. But with the Mau and the MuMu slaughtering anyone who crosses into "their" territory, the hunters aren't able to keep all of us supplied.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you please hunt Airon or Slink to get Thin Rawhide, then bring it back here and make it into Thin Leather, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Good. If you go to the Altgard Ice Lake, you'll be able to catch plenty of Airons and Slinks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gather up the Thin Rawhide you collect and make it into Thin Leather using this loom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not hard to do--even a beginner should be able to manage it. Still, you'd better collect extra hides, as you're likely to slip up and ruin a few.</p>

          <p>I suppose it isn't any of your business. Technically, it's my problem, but where I come from, Asmodians look out for one another. Where did you grow up? A raider camp, wasn't it?</p>

          <p>Hello! Did you manage to prepare the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2910b]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I know you're just starting out, so it doesn't matter if the leather's a bit rough round the edges. So long as it's supple, it'll do fine. Let me have a look at what you made.</p>

          <p>Thank you. You're a true Asmodian, [%username]. This will do just fine, for now.</p>

          <p>I've learned my lesson, too. No more running down the leather stock with an important job just around the corner. You might not be here to help next time!</p>
