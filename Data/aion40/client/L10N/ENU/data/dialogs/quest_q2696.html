          <p>Azoturan Fortress is home to many Test Subjects created by the Aetherogenetics Lab. They're even using some of them to defend the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Pretors and Kirrins have acute senses of smell and hearing. They've foiled my every infiltration attempt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They need to be stopped at the source, so go after the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CL_LehparAsBreeder_44_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CL_LehparWaBreeder_44_Ae]s. That should make getting inside the fortress easier.</p>

          <p>Excellent. That's excellent. Now I can learn more about the Lepharists' activities here, and discover what they just took inside.</p>

          <p>Pretors and Kirrins? You don't need to worry. They're nothing once they've lost their masters.</p>
