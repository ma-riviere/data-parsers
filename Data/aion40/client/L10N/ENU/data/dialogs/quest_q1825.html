          <p>Reshanta was discovered a long time ago, but the Eye of Reshanta still remains a mystery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Almost nothing is known about this place. We don't know who built it or when. Or what lies in the lower layer of the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, we have attempted many times to find out, but we've made little progress.</p>

          <p>For example, the Defenders at the foot of the fortress attack us ruthlessly whenever we get close to them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Considering such aggressiveness, I presume they must protect something important... In any case, they seem to prevent other creatures from settling down in the Eye of Reshanta. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to learn more, we need to eliminate those Defenders. But there is one thing that bothers me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Based on what we know of them and their behaviors, they might have been made by a Dragon Lord. But this is all conjecture.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will not be easy, though.</p>

          <p>I am relieved that you will take this task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What we need to get a look at is the Defender's Core. Ventus argued that we could figure out what kind of power they have by analyzing the cores inside their bodies. It seems a good place to begin. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, please defeat of[%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_CyclopsOd_50_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_CyclopsFire_50_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_BoneDrake_50_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_AgrintGi_50_An], collect their cores, and bring them to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This mission will require finesse. Intact cores are very difficult to get because cores, despite their seeming durability, are very vulnerable to external shock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish you good luck, then.</p>

          <p>To be frank with you, I didn't expect that you could obtain all of the cores of Aether's Defender, Fire's Defender, Ancient Defender, and Nature's Defender. I thought you would bring one or two of them, at best, with luck on your side.</p>

          <p>Hypnos complained that the Defenders have interrupted his investigation of the Eye of Reshanta. Explaining that he could not destroy them recklessly because little is known about them, he asked you to collect the cores of Aether's Defender, Fire's Defender, Ancient Defender, and Nature's Defender.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As he asked, you defeated the Defenders near the fortress and collected four different cores from them. When you brought the cores, he said he would send them to Ventus for further study.</p>
