          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Do you remember that scrumptious dish I prepared for you and the Blue Fleet Sailors a few nights back? The Basilisk Ribs that were so tender, the meat just slid right off the bone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahh, that was the magnum opus of feasts, wasn't it? I'm going to try and top it this time. I want to marinate the ribs in Mudthorn Sap then simmer them over a soft flame.</p>

          <p>I've run out of some ingredients, though. We'll have a riot on our hands if I don't get these sailors their Basilisk Ribs and Mudthorn Sap for dinner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever seen a crew of angry, hungry sailors? It's not a pleasant sight.</p>

          <p>You're saving my reputation, [%username]! Thank you. Without you, these sailors would be subjected to my Striped Maeki stew again. You ever tasted a Striped Maeki? It's not pleasant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I'll need five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622a]s and five bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1622b]. These sailors have an appetite like a Warg in winter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm starting the stew, so please hurry.</p>

          <p>I understand, [%username]. It's not the most glorious task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess the Blue Fleet Sailors will have to prepare their gullets for another round of Striped Maeki stew. I suppose I should also warn the lavatory keepers...quite the mess last time.</p>
