          <p>The Aether is weakening the Balaur, but they're still holding out at Indratu Barracks. It's time to deliver the deathblow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must vanquish their leader once and for all. The Balaur will learn that coming to Heiron means certain death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a difficult mission, but no one is more qualified than you, [%username]. Your destruction of the Balaur Guardian Stones was brilliant. It's clear that the Seraphim Lords are lighting your way.</p>

          <p>They call themselves the "Indratu Legion" because they're led by a powerful Naga named Indratu.</p>

          <p>Indratu is not in Heiron--he's at the Indratu Fortress somewhere in the Abyss. But the same Abyss Gate that brought the Balaur here can take you right to the Abyss...and to Indratu himself. </p>

          <p>Lamidros tells us the Abyss Gate is in the deepest recesses of the Nute Warrens. Do whatever you must to go through that gate and vanquish [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterNM_47_Ah].</p>

          <p>I had faith in you, but I still worried. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to say I never doubted you, but...the Brigadier Indratu himself was a formidable adversary. He had so many underlings. I was worried you'd be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of numbers. Go directly to Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fasimedes]--he'll want to hear of this stunning victory from the Daeva who crushed the Balaur!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But you lit the way for us all, [%username]. We should be able to mop up the remnants of Indratu's so-called "Legion" in short order.</p>

          <p>You went to the deepest recess of the Nute Warrens, found the Abyss Gate, discovered the Balaur fortress in the Abyss, and destroyed Brigadier Indratu.</p>
