         <p>I've heard your name a lot, [%username]. You seem to be the sort who attracts attention.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Many say you used to be a raider on society's fringe. And I've heard rumors that you're in contact with a certain...imprisoned dissident, let's say.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Then there's your record. In your short time as a Daeva, you achieved a great deal.</p>

         <p>My point is this: All that attention isn't necessarily a good thing. People may be watching you, but some of them are trying to spot a hidden weakness.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Now more than ever, you should always be thinking about what you're showing others as you fight for Asmodae.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>It wouldn't surprise me if you receive a summons from the Shadow Court someday. And on that day, you'll really need to watch your behavior.</p>

          <p>Phyper in Brusthonin told you to be mindful of unseen watchers, especially if the Shadow Court sends you a summons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since then, you forgot that incident. But one day the Shadow Court's summons arrived. Khrudgelmir said he received a note that asked you to go to the Triniel Coliseum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you asked Garm the Arena Master about the summons, he told you that he didn't know what you were talking about. But he said a mysterious figure at the entrance of the underground arena might be a Shadow Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you investigated, three people ambushed you and knocked you unconscious. When you woke up, you were in the secret prison of the Shadow Court. You managed to escape from there after defeating dozens of beasts and undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you went to Khrudgelmir again and told him what happened, he said that there must have been a mistake and he would investigate it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You couldn't dispel your suspicion, so you went to Altgard and told Munin what happened. Then he asked you to be more careful, saying that you could have vanished without a trace.</p>
