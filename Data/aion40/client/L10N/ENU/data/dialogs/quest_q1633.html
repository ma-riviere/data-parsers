          <p>By the way, have you ever been to Stenon Bay? The beach in front of the Nolantis Altar?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While patrolling, one of my subordinates saw a shipwreck there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said it was in very bad shape, but it didn't look that old. Do you know anything about it?</p>

          <p>Hmm, this is very odd. My subordinate reports the sailors in the ship were cursed, possibly by Bollvig. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that's true, we should deal with them as soon as we can. But my real concern is that this ship is somehow related to the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one I've asked knows anything about that, but I've not yet checked the story with the priest. Would you speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Antione] for me?</p>
