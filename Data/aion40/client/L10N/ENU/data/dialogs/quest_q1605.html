          <p>The spy's a tough one--I'll give him that. I got some information out of him, but not much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, the Lepharists are conducting live body experiments on the Elim and Gorgons... I'm not sure if they've performed them on Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, this information must be passed up the chain of command.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Would you deliver this report to Graa at New Heiron Gate?</p>
