          <p>Lisya vouched for you, but I still withheld judgment. So many have disappointed me in the past. However, you have proven yourself up to the challenge!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I have a most important task for you. Gangs of Elyos Daevas have been waylaying some of our officers, trying to undermine our strategies and destroy our morale.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such an act deserves a most decisive response.</p>

          <p>The Elyos have officers just like we do, ranking from 1-star to 5-star. They're the ones who've been harassing us, and they're the ones we need to target.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The cowards don't dare face our officers one-on-one, of course, so they've been attacking in groups. You should rally your friends, and do likewise. Got it?</p>

          <p>Good. I assumed you would be up to this task, so I've already let everyone know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, just remember that it's the officers we need to take out. If you run up against a mob of unskilled Elyos, don't waste too much time messing with them. We have other, less capable people than you to sort out the riff-raff.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With any luck, this will break their morale and allow us an opening for a larger attack.</p>
