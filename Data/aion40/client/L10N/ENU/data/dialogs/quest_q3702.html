          <p>Don't take this lightly, [%username]. Those Balaur might still be learning to fight properly, but they were born strong and smart. Can't build a castle on marshland--can't make a Balaur warrior from a wimp.</p>

          <p>Now, the place is called the Nochsana Training Camp, and it's central to the Balaur war preparations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To get into the camp you'll have to destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_Door_Dr]. I want you to find and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_DrakanFi_27_Ah], and anything that gets in your way. Then take flight and return to me for your reward.</p>

          <p>Good. The best way to get to the Training Camp is to approach the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_AB1_Corridor_Q3702] our archaeologists are still uncovering. That's to the west of Teminon Landing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you're in the compound, move fast. Stay in one place too long, and you'll be surrounded. You'll need to activate the Shield of Compassion artifact, then take down the Fortress Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use whatever means you can--just be fast, all right? I don't want to lose you in there.</p>
