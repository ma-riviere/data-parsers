          <p>While you went to catch Ashulagens and Petrahulks, I sent letters to scholars who specialize in this field, asking them about Fregion's Flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've received replies, but none are satisfactory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I can think of is to ask someone who knows everything.</p>

          <p>You may have met her already. She's a woman named Fuchsia who's well-informed on many topics. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She helped us to solve the Artifact problem, and I believe she's also interested in the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry to ask, but can you please go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vatonia] and ask her how to put out Fregion's Flame?</p>
