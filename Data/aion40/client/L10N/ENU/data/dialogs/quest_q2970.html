          <p>(A tag hangs from the thin stem of the potion bottle. Though the words are partially obscured by a dark stain, you can still make out the message: "Supply to: Reshanta Primum Landing, attention [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Blir].")</p>

          <p>Have you come for supplies? I hope not, for your sake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You’d have more luck asking the Balaur if you could borrow some of their provisions. I just don’t have the stock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ordering's no problem--the difficulty is actually getting it. If I start demanding twice as much as I need, perhaps I’ll end up with the right amount!</p>

          <p>Hah! Seems I spoke too soon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You’ve got me out of a tricky situation, friend. Legionaries tend to take it personally when you promise them potions and don’t come up with the goods. Especially when they have wounds that won’t wait!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you. If you hadn’t helped, I might have needed some of this myself. Blood for blood, Daeva.</p>
