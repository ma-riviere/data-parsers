          <p>Everyone in Elysea wants White Dye. It's always the first to sell out. I don't even keep it on display, it goes so quickly. I only make it to order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People see white clothes as a status symbol--not just because they're hard to keep clean, but also because they look so attractive with wings. Don't you think?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the light catches you as you fly, white armor shines like stars!</p>

          <p>Emerald green is the next most popular color.</p>

          <p>White Dye is made from [%dic:STR_DIC_E_plant_n_c_10a] from the plants found in Poeta and Verteron. It may sound strange to make a dye out of fiber, but it works. Emerald Green Dye is made from the body fluids of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Vespa_22_n]s in Eltnen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Dye Remover is made from...don't tell this to anyone...the sap of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ClodwormRe2_21_An]s in Theobomos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring me Ruko Fiber, Vespine Ichor, and Stinky Sap, I'll give you some dye as a reward.</p>
