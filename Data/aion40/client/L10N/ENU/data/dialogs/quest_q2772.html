          <p>Kuenunerk learned Roah was once a big, big city full of rich, rich Atreians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rich means treasure! Kuenunerk discovered tons of ancient jewelry and accessories.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those things are profitable, but there is something here much more valuable than all of them combined, yes?</p>
