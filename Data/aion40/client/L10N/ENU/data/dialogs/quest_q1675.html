          <p>A visiting Daeva once cooked some fish I'd never seen before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It smelled delicious. He offered me some from his meal. It tasted wonderful! I never knew a fish could taste so good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He told me it was [%dic:STR_DIC_gb_fish_n_c_30b]. I've dreamed of it ever since.</p>

          <p>Not just good--unforgettable! I can't forget the taste of Roast Megrim. I really don't want to eat anything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I found a lake filled with Megrim. But it's next to the Tigric Village...they'd kill me if I tried fishing there.</p>

          <p>To get to the Tigric Village and the lake where the [%dic:STR_DIC_gb_fish_n_c_30b] are, you'll have to go through the Poya Jungle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tigrics are savage, and I hear the lake is also full of Moonflowers. Please be careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't ordinarily ask someone to do something so dangerous, but if you don't bring me those Megrim, I'll fade away from hunger.</p>
