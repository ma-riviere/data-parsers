          <p>Hmm. An article that genuinely warrants my attention! How quaint!</p>

          <p>I've seen similar things before, from the Reshanta Fortress, if memory serves. They've all been sent on to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lycian].</p>

          <p>I suggest you do the same. He may need this piece.</p>

          <p>Yes yes, I remember them well! Couldn't ever figure out their use, and they weren't old enough to be of significant interest to us. I'm afraid the samples I had were all sent up to Sanctum to be melted down for the blacksmith.</p>

          <p>Anusis looked at the item, decided it would be useful to him, and paid you for it.</p>
