          <p>I can't believe how hard it is to get Sobi these days. Tange too, for that matter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There used to be Sobi and Tange everywhere around here. We could just collect them whenever we needed. But these days they're so rare...I'm reluctant to part with any, just in case I need it later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sure do hate those Manduris.</p>

          <p>Manduris dig up and eat every herb they can smell, no matter what it is, and that includes Sobi and Tange.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we don't do anything, every useful plant around here will go extinct!</p>

          <p>I'm glad you understand the problem. We've got to cut down the number of Manduris.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't need to kill them all, of course. Just 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriBRe_39_An]s and 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ManduriTRe_39_An]s should be fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you don't have trouble telling them apart.</p>

          <p>Oh, hey [%username]. After you left I did some research into what else the Manduri eat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get this! They also eat Sylphen Wings and Frillneck Tail Bones. They're tougher than they look!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>These plants could become extinct if nothing is done, so you agreed to hunt down some of the Manduris.</p>
