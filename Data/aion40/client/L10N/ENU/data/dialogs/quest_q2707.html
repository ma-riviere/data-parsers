          <p>Lisya has spoken highly of you, [%username]. The respect of a Red Hasia Centurion is not lightly given--yet she said you stepped up and completed the dangerous missions she set before you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will put my trust and confidence in you as Lisya did. By the blood-dipped flower I wear, I'll not reject such a valuable asset! You may not be a Legionary of mine, but you fight like one. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These missions, should you accept them, will be arduous--yet they may change the outcome of the war.</p>

          <p>Rank 4 Elyos Soldiers are interfering with our scouting missions. Those glow-worms are quite well trained and experienced in the arts of war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if you are as good as Lisya says, they will not be easy to defeat. Will you wipe out the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade4]s, [%username]? We need your help.</p>

          <p>You have my gratitude. If you succeed in eliminating this threat to the Red Hasia Legion we will be one step closer to exterminating the twiggies entirely. </p>
