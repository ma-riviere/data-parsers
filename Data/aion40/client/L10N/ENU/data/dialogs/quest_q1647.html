          <p>I wonder when we'll see peace and quiet again. Every Daeva and their uncle has here come just to try to get rid of Bollvig, and now this Blue Fleet has come to do the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't they realize none of the Daevas who went to fight him came back? But I think I know how to solve the problem without fighting.</p>

          <p>Bollvig may be an Archon, but he's also a man blinded by love. He would do anything to see his precious Myanee again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If one were to disguise herself as Myanee, one could certainly persuade Bollvig to return to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is the flute Myanee used to play when she was alive. If you play it, Bollvig cannot fail to hear it. His heart will, even if his ears do not.</p>

          <p>Good. First, disguise yourself as Myanee. She always used to wear the same clothes--a Stenon Blouse and matching Stenon Skirt. I don't think you'll find them in Heiron, but Arcinia in Sanctum is certain to have them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Put on the outfit and go to the Stone Statue inside the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_013]. Bollvig and Myanee used to meet there in secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Touch the Stone Statue and play Myanee's Flute. Bollvig will come, and you can persuade him to go back to Asmodae and leave us alone.</p>
