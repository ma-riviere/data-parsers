          <p>I have never seen a Daeva handle a loom as deftly as you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Did you learn the loom before you became a Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you have some natural talent. In fact, I'd like to test you. It's very simple. I'm going to ask you to make a special item. Interested?</p>

          <p>Then, make Daphnis' Noble Sash and bring it to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've done a lot of Tailoring, so you know it takes dedication to make such a sash. To make the finest goods, you must lavish care on them at every stage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's one thing you should keep in mind. If you become a Tailoring Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So please consider carefully before you answer. </p>

          <p>You can buy the Daphnis' Noble Sash design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Proserpina]. Don't confuse it with the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1982] design. They're similar, but [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1982] is a far less complex pattern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might be best if you finish up your most urgent business before starting this. Once you begin, you won't have time to care about anything else. You know, I often forget to eat while I'm hard at work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you finish, bring it to me. I'll be waiting for you.</p>
