          <p>Let me tell you a little of my strategy, [%username]. Here in Reshanta, the upper layer is more important than the lower layer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It has more fortresses, and it's also home of the path leading to the deepest layer of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So now we focus our efforts on Reshanta's upper layer, and on two fortresses in particular.</p>

          <p>Although all the fortresses are important, Roah Fortress and Krotan Refuge play vital roles in keeping the Elyos in check.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Roah Fortress, situated above the Teminon Landing of Elysea, is the first fortress coming up the Western Shard of Latesran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Krotan Refuge also holds a strategic location close to the Elyos base on the Triple Island, one of the key points of the Reshanta upper layer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we keep [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2738]s of these two fortresses in check, we can cripple enemy movements in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>The key to controlling the Ellies' movements is taking the Roah Fortress and the Krotan Refuge.</p>
