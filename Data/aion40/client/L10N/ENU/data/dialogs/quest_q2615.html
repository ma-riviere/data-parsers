          <p>Brigade General Thor has ordered me to find a new strategic foothold nearer the Balaur encampment. Red Mane Cavern is too far for effective spying, he says.</p>

          <p>He wants to establish a new bind point near the Hoarfrost Fortress.</p>

          <p>But the place I have in mind is the Fang Troll Encampment. It's in the perfect position.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, it's also full of Fang Trolls. But that's not necessarily an insurmountable problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The real problem is not committing our forces to cleaning out the trolls while leaving ourselves open to Balaur attack.</p>

          <p>Destroy their houses. Make them retreat to a more remote location.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That can be done with a much smaller force, possibly without attracting attention from the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Good. I probably don't have to tell you how stupid trolls are, but not so stupid that they won't run away when someone obliterates their houses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So get yourself to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_G1] and take down some [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_TrollHouse_Q2615]s, then report back to me. </p>
