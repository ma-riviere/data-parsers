          <p>Humans achieve so much in their short lives. They study, work, love, marry, and raise children. For most of a Human lifetime I've done only one thing--study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now, I respect Humans more than I ever have. You see...I've fallen in love. I can't think about anything else. How do they cope? How do they manage to deal with all of that emotion?</p>

          <p>You know the old saying "opposites attract"? I always thought that was just a clumsy device for writers of dreadful romantic fiction. But I understand now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My idea of a good time is a tall stack of books in the Temple of Knowledge. But Eramir wants to drink and party every night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's amazing that we managed to meet at all, to be honest. We live on opposite sides of Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>Perhaps it was. At first we could spend all day just gazing into each other's eyes. But now it seems all we have time to do is fight. Eramir is so busy hitting every party in Pandaemonium that he never bothers to come and see me!</p>

          <p>The Encyclopedia of Love says the most important factor in love is power. The dominant partner is the one who decides who visits whom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I refuse to be the submissive partner in this, [%username]. I've got to give Eramir an ultimatum. Either he drags himself over here to see me or it's over!</p>

          <p>Oh would you? That would be wonderful! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eramir] will be at the Airship Dock. He likes busy crowded places.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't have to go into detail. Just tell him that Moreinen wants him to come to the Temple of Knowledge. And she isn't going to be the one to visit him this time. And he should hurry it up if she's important to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The last time I saw him was three days ago. If he doesn't come to see me now, I...I guess it means he's found someone else.</p>

          <p>When you conveyed her message, Eramir said that he would visit her.</p>
