          <p>It's hard to believe, but they really put Aether in it. You see, the fastest way to absorb the power of Aether is to ingest Odium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since Odium is quite toxic, most people would die before they even swallowed it. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Krall have fierce constitutions, but even they would have to dilute it in order to survive drinking it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would explain why they've suddenly become stronger.</p>

          <p>It is definitely bad. I must report this to the Fortress right away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, deliver this potion to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aurelius] in Eltnen Fortress. He knows a lot about these things, so he should be able to identify the ingredients and ratios used.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he's done, tell him to report his findings to the Commander. This should be his highest priority.</p>
