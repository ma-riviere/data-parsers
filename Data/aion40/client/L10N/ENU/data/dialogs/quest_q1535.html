          <p>You're surrounded by ancient ruins, and you can enjoy Vaizel's Peak.... I've been always interested in studying ancient history.</p>

          <p>I can deal with the dust and noisy animals, but the nighttime wind is cold--I guess it's the high altitude. Also, the place is covered with rocks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm accustomed to harsh terrains, but my body aches by nightfall.</p>

          <p>The earth and wind are blessings of Aion, but I find I cannot summon the necessary focus to pray unless I'm protected from the cold.</p>

          <p>If I only had a soft mat made of animal skin to lay on the cold, hard ground.</p>

          <p>It doesn't take much to make a good mat.</p>

          <p>I'll need five pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_1535a]--it's fine and soft but rather thin. Three pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_1535b] would also do, because it's tough and thick. </p>

          <p>Alternately, one piece of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_1535c] would do, since it's thicker than either of the others.</p>
