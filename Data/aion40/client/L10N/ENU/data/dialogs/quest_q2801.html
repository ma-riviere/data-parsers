          <p>Everything's gone scaly--we've lost Siel's Eastern Fortress to the sun-poxed enemy!</p>

          <p>We've got to take it back. But we've got to be careful.</p>

          <p>This will be a high-priority operation. When we attack, we need to be sure we can win. I hear you're just the help we need.</p>

          <p>The Elyos garrison is at full strength right now. They've taken the fortress, their morale is high, and they've just received fresh troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we were fighting the Balaur it would be no problem, but the Elyos have the advantage, so we need help from outside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to get that blasted garrison out of the way. Can you help us with that, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you. Here's your task: Observe the situation at Siel's Eastern Fortress. Once the fortress is in Vulnerable State, attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wipe out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2801_all], including Elyos Fighters, Archers, Mages, and Priests, whether they're Veterans, Experienced or Novices. Bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2801a]s as the proof of their defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry about the Balaur--focus on keeping the Elyos in check. Blood for blood!</p>

<p>Ogmund said that to recapture Siel's Eastern Fortress from the Elyos, it was crucial to defeat the garrison defending the site.</p>

<p>After defeating the Elyos occupiers, you returned to Ogmund with the Guardian's Insignias as your proof of success.</p>
