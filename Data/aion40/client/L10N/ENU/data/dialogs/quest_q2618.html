          <p>I carry out every order from Beluslan Fortress, but it's not easy to distinguish oneself in a place like this.</p>

          <p>Everyone here is capable and competent--most are downright gifted.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I want to do something they haven't even thought of in Beluslan and, at the same time, I'd like it to directly impact our mission here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau want to mount an expedition to gather Mamut Bones at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_D3], but there are so many Snowy Mamuts there that they're concerned about the danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taking care of the Mamuts quickly will be good for our relationship with the Mau.</p>

          <p>You can help me make a name for myself around here and strengthen our alliance. I can't lead a patrol out when the Balaur might come down on this place any moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if you'd go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_D3] and get rid of some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteD_41_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteSmallD_41_An]s around there, the Mau's gratitude won't go unnoticed by Brigade General Nerita.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll be good for both our careers, I think.</p>

          <p>If it's to be made safe for Mau gatherers, it has to be cleared of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteD_41_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteSmallD_41_An]s.</p>
