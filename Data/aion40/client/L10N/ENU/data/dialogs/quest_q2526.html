          <p>I had a strange experience yesterday. I'd transformed into a Snowy Mosbear so I could scout near the places where they congregate, and suddenly I lost my concentration and reverted to my natural form.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mosbears were not pleased to see me. Luckily someone threw a stone to divert their attention, and I was able to get away.</p>

          <p>Believe it or not, it was a Sprigg named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gark]! I was speechless! It actually asked me if I was okay!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd heard about talking Spriggs before, but I'd never met one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said they used to live around there but the Mosbears kicked them out. He seemed to have lost track of his tribe.</p>

          <p>Who knows? Probably fewer than there used to be, thanks to the Mosbears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was hungry, but I didn't have anything to give him. I was in a hurry to get back, so Svera wouldn't worry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gark] the Sprigg weighs on my mind. I should have helped him. [%username], will you check on him for me?</p>

          <p>I think an Asmodian should repay debts, even to such a lowly creature as a Sprigg. It's what makes us better than the Elyos.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gark] was hiding behind the tree in one corner of the Mosbear Snowfield. I don't know if he's still there, but that's a place to start.</p>
