          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. I see your fate intertwined with that of another. Your face, their face...the images blur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their destiny is similar to yours--that I can see. You will meet and be kindred spirits. They are ascended as well, but lack your strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To fight the Balaur and the Elyos is too much to ask of this person. They need you to lend them your strength, [%userclass]!</p>
