          <p>[%username], come here, quickly!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've read a report on you, good work. You should know that Tyr, the Aetheric Field Protector, reports a violent vortex of Aether in the Mist Mane village. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Given what we know, they must have have opened the Abyss Gate. </p>

          <p>How is not important. It has happened. Now we survive and succeed at the next test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is unfortunate that the Mist Manes defeated the Silver Mane Tribe. If the tribes were still warring, the Mau could never have opened the Abyss Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I called you. I think you are the only person in Morheim capable of this assignment.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Mist Mane village, and meet with Taisan, an Elim disguised as a Gnarl. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That Mau you reported should still be inside the gate. Work with it to block the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Aegir said the Mist Mane Mau seemed to have opened an Abyss Gate. He gave you the key and told you to go to the Mist Mane village to block the Abyss Gate. On the way, Taisan gave you a desiccated root to boosts your defense. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You entered the Abyss Gate and met Kargate, Prophet of the Silver Mane Tribe. Kargate was blocking the Balaur from coming through but needed to destroy the Gate. So you took care of the advancing Draconutes and Nagas while Kargate destroyed the gate with magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After destroying the gate, you reported back to Aegir. He praised you and said that he would report the result to Pandaemonium right away.</p>
