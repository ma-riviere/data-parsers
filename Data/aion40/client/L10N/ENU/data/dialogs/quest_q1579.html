          <p>Medeus Manor is overrun with the undead. I know they were just settlers trying to get by, but in death they're a hazard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't let this continue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to find out what caused it, why we've got so many undead.</p>

          <p>Well, the right answer would be the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I found some odd-colored bones at Medeus Manor West. Old bones fade, but these.... The color looked artificial--just odd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may be a clue to why the residents rose from the dead, if I can get a closer look. Or maybe Sanctum can help us. Would you please collect some for me, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1579a] near the buildings around Medeus Manor.</p>

          <p>Five should be enough for my research.</p>
