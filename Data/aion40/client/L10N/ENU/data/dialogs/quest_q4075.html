          <p>Well enough. You may have heard that another party arrived here shortly after the Wisdom Orb Legion. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their goal is to cultivate the northern part of Brusthonin. Thanks to your efforts they have a chance to gain a foothold on Havenjark Farm.</p>

          <p>I'd like to send a progress report back to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bielia]. [%username], would you deliver it? </p>

          <p>Thank you for volunteering. Take this status report over to Baltasar Hill Village and deliver it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bielia]. It contains details of our progress at the Settlers Campsite and in the southern region of Brusthonin. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I recommend you fly, since the village is quite far. Ullur can transport you to Baltasar Hill.</p>

          <p>Ah, something from Randet and the Wisdom Orb Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad things are going well for them. As well as can be expected, anyway.</p>

          <p>We're fortunate to have the protection of Baltasar here. Out there they've got to be on guard constantly. It can't be easy, but they endure like true Asmodians.</p>
