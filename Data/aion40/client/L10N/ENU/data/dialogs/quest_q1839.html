          <p>We're wasting time, [%username]. We can't sit on our laurels and pat each other on the back just because we've taken control of the Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to press home our advantage. The Balaur are off balance, and now we must attack them again and make them fall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Eciel_SZ_All], and wrest control of the place from the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Right before our eyes, actually, only it has been cloaked by strange forces. To get there, you simply walk through the stone gate next to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help, [%username]? The area is brimming with Balaur treasures, and though we expect most to be returned to Elyos officials, I'm sure we'd turn a blind eye to the odd missing trinket.</p>

          <p>Good. Glad to see your reputation as a reliable Daeva is deserved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as you enter the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Eciel_SZ_All], you'll be detected and the Balaur will move to hide their treasure from you. You'll have to fight fast to guarantee getting hold of anything valuable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck. Kill them all, and come back in one piece.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ever want to enter the chamber again, just say so. Our fights there are always difficult, so someone like you might well be the force that swings the battle in our favor.</p>
