          <p>I took the position of handicraft master a couple of days ago. THEN I find out that my predecessor, may Worgs gnaw on his misshapen ribs, promised to make a chair for the Governor!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told him we didn't have the time. "No time," I said. I explained that we didn't have the materials. "No materials," I said. "Oh, you can handle it," he said.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the whole job gets dumped in my lap! What's worse, we're almost out of wood!</p>

          <p>Altgard is a ways off, true, but gathering wood isn't difficult. I'd do it myself, but...well, you see how swamped we are!</p>
