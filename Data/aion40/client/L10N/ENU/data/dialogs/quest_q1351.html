          <p>Daeva, hold a second! Heading for the Eracus Temple Cavern?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I have a strong suggestion when you do. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Marana], Elysea's best Flight Instructor, guards the entrance to the Eracus Temple Cavern.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's no boast. Sanctum officially certified her. She can teach you things about flight known nowhere else. </p>

          <p>The problem is, Marana's very particular about her students. She only accepts students of exceptional skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you qualify. You willing to try?</p>

          <p>Hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_4C_Gargoyle_30_Ae]s of Eracus Temple Cavern and take Marana 10 of their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1351a]s. Even Marana will concede you've got promise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a tough challenge. First, it is difficult to find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_4C_Gargoyle_30_Ae]s among the stones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, there are several towers and time is limited. And of course the Gargoyles swarm upon all intruders. So...be careful.</p>
