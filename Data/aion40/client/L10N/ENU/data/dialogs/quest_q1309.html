          <p>A forest holds a lifetime of memories. It is a stage on which people and creatures alike perform. Trees carry both the scars of war and the marks of the lovelorn young.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So many stories. So many memories. Think about what you have seen in your short time here, [%username], and now try to comprehend what Biadri feels when he senses this ancient forest dying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The forest's greens and blues fade into a desert's yellows and browns. And while forests hold lifetimes, deserts frame footprints for just a moment before they are blown away forever.</p>

          <p>From the Manduri Village, you say? Strange. They steal brightly colored, shiny objects, not literature. I'll assume they took this by accident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is very old. See the yellowed pages? Air and sunlight do that to a book over a great deal of time. The text was made using a charcoal stick of some kind, but I can say little more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vatonia] in Sanctum. She can help you where I could not.</p>

          <p>Let me see. This paper is from a greenfen tree. Though faded, the smell of the sap is unmistakable. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the greenfen tree only grows in a small grove in Eltnen, now contained within the Manduri Village. How intriguing! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The words, if they are words, are too smudged and spoiled, for my eyes, [%username]. Allow me to send it to a friend whose trade is repairing and restoring old books. Come back later; perhaps we will have unravelled this mystery.</p>

          <p>You found a book in the Manduri Village. It looked very old and the strange letters inside were faded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You showed it to Phomona, who recommended you take it to Fuchsia, one of Elysea's most knowledgeable Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fuchsia looked over the book but could not determine its origin. She asked you to leave it with her so she could take it to a restoration expert and suggested you check back later.</p>
