          <p>Brigade General Thor, it seems, plans to launch an all-out assault on the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wisely, he's bolstering his intelligence-gathering efforts and trying to strike alliances.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Hoarfrost Mau would be splendid allies, assuming there's enough of them left able to fight.</p>

          <p>Perhaps, but right now all we're getting out of it is mewing and hairballs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is the Mau don't trust us much more than the Balaur. There's a lot of bad blood between us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why don't you try your hand at diplomacy? They may respond more favorably to you. Let Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Thor] know how you fare.</p>
