          <p>The Prototype Weapons. They are constantly developing new weapons and the first place they send the new creations is Nochsana Training Camp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They can't just throw the items onto the battlefield and hope for the best--that would be madness. The Balaur aren't as stupid as we might like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of our scouts said that the test weapons are kept inside Balaur Weapons Chests. I need you to bring back that weapon.</p>
