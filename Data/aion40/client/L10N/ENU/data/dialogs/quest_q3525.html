          <p>Is your sould at peace, child of Aion? Then think of the spirits at Stenon Bay, killed during the battle against Bollvig.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's because of that Cursed Obelisk raised by the Archon--our fallen Daevas can neither resurrect nor return to the flow of Aether. They are doomed to wander aimlessly for eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been in this village for weeks and hope the arrival of the Sanctum Detachment and the Blue Fleet will mean peace for the unquiet.</p>

          <p>Obviously, I'd like to resurrect the Daevas, but that's not a possibility. They've been wandering as spirits for too long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose the only option is to return their souls to the flow of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does that sit well with you? Could you handle that?</p>

          <p>Thank you. I thought of asking the Blue Fleet or the Sanctum Guardians, but they don't have the grace for this type of mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadLightWi_44_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadLightFi_43_An]s will put up a fight. But they'll thank you in the end.</p>

          <p>Those were the souls of all those you returned to the flow of Aether, Daeva. You have done well.</p>
