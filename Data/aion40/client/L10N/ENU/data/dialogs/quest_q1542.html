          <p>Was that a sigh of acceptance? I'd be very grateful if you could get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Frillfaimam1st_37_An]s around here.</p>

          <p>He asked you to get rid of Frillnecks around the camp, because the threat of another attack made him very nervous. You got rid of Frillnecks as requested, and he was very grateful.</p>
