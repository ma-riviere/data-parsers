           <p>Every edge we can get over the Balaur in this region is vital. It can mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Conditioning is one of those edges. That extra bit of power could be a vital tipping point.</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>If you have any items that can be Conditioned, I recommend you put it into my care straight away.</p>
