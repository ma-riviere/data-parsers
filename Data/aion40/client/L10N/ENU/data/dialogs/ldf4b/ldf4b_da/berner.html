          <p>I wonder if Kahrun asked us, and only us, to help at this outpost because he trusts us, or he wants to keep an eye on us?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come to think of it, we must assume that some other outpost out there is being aided only by Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, I'm glad I'm here. None of those Ellies around to distract me or make me tense.</p>
