          <p>Being a trainer here is a vital position. This is the closest we've ever gotten to one of the Dragon Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course I miss being on the battlefield myself, but what I teach will put hundreds of Daevas like me into the fray.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a much more efficient arrangement, so I can appreciate why I'm here instead of out there.</p>

          <p>So far, so good. Our preparations for our assault on Tiamat are well underway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, even as we make our move, the Balaur are preparing as well, to counter our assault.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't underestimate them or Tiamat. Nor can we make the slightest mistake.</p>

          <p>Of course. The key to opening Tiamaranta's Eye and weakening Tiamat are the four Heart fortresses in the corners of this land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They and the Eye itself are exempt from Kahrun's Will, so it's important that we take over as many of the Hearts as possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you got all that. My duty is to make sure all Daevas here know what to do and what's at stake.</p>
