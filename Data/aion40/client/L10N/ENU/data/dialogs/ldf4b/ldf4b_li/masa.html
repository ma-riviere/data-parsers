          <p>You don't seem to be able to use Stigmas. You must be very powerful to have come so far without that ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, it does mean that I am of no use to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I do suggest that you learn the ability to equip Stigmas, then return. You'll find it very useful in the battles ahead.</p>
