          <p>We must defeat Tiamat before the Elyos do. And recover Siel's Relics. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To do so, we must occupy at least two Hearts of power and open a path to Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can enter the Eye through the entrance of the Vasharti Legion Garrison. However, the Reians came up with a measure to send our forces more effectively.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reian Sorcerers promise to open the path to Tiamaranta's Eye, so increase your efforts to help soldiers occupy the Hearts. </p>
