          <p>Look at this map. Paints a grim picture, doesn't it? Yet morale must take a back seat to accuracy. It's the only way we can win.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been sent here to make the grim picture look a little brighter. But it can't happen without help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is why Kahrun is enforcing this truce. If Asmodians and Elyos were fighting each other as well as Balaur, Tiamat would win easily. Keep that in mind.</p>
