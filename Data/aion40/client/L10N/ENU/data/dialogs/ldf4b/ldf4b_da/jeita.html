          <p>I have my doubts about Porin. He seems like such a weakling. Sometimes I see him shake like Cippo jelly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But perhaps he keeps his true strength in reserve, like the spice in a Beluslan chili. I could respect that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I won't know for sure until his mettle is put to the test. If he is weak, it'll be too late.</p>
