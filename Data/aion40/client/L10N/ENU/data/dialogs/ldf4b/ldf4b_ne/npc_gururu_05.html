          <p>In my dream, I walked among the elegant spires and twisted battlements of the Reian capitol.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot recall having been to Kamar, but as I wandered the city, I felt the certainty and ease of one ambling the well-known streets of home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The beautiful Reians greeted me as their equal, calling me by a name not my own but intimately familiar all the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I woke, this body was foreign to me. I cannot bear this false life any longer, Daeva, you must help me!</p>
