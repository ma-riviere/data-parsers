          <p>Skafir is one of the best commanders I've ever had. I'm privileged to be working under her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But while I admire her valor, it also makes me nervous. She's much too willing to do things with her own claws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm constantly having to keep her off the front lines, or arranging guards for her. It's exhausting.</p>
