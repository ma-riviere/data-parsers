          <p>Well, I hate to bother you with it. There's this cooking contest in [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07], you see. I'm dying to enter it with my latest and greatest recipe--grilled Airon steak with Green Peppercorn Sauce and chopped Aria.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's just one problem. I'm missing the main ingredient: the Airon steak! I'm terrified of Airons, so there's no way I can go near one, let alone kill it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know, [%username]. I really don't know what to do. Do you... think you could help me with this? I need someone to go and collect the steaks.</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you so much!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please get me some [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA05] from three [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA05]s. You should be able to find whole flocks of them out by [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA03]. That should be enough to test the recipe and enter the contest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you have the meat, take it to my wife, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA07]. She's gathering the Aria we need, and I need time to prepare this Peppercorn Sauce. I am already salivating at the thought of it!</p>
