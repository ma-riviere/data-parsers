          <p>Before I was posted here, I received several briefings about the threats facing this outpost. The heat, supply problems, and the dangerous groups who want to take over the Observatory just to name a few.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now I realize how wrong all of those reports were.</p>

          <p>Not so much inaccurate as incomplete. I've come to think that the animals are a very serious problem, one too quickly dismissed by my predecessors. We spend far too much time fighting the animals instead of the insurgents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Rynoces and Drynacs are the worst of all. They're very bold, invading the Observatory whenever they feel like it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hunt them when I see them, but it is too much for Kibelle and I to handle along with our regular duties.</p>
