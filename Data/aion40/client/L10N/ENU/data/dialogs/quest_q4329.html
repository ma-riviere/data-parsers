          <p>Everything has a story, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at these glasses. Found them near one of the Tripeed Monsters I hacked to pieces earlier today. Size tells me they belonged to a child, decorations point to a little girl.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She'd wouldn't have stood a chance against the Tripeeds. Least it would have been quick, I suppose.</p>

          <p>Anyway, there's no one called Ami here. Could be a kid from a trading caravan or another village though. Why don't you go and ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Karina]? She knows more about who comes and goes than the guards, nosey little so-and-so....</p>

          <p>Thank you so much! I have a spare pair but they're not as comfortable, and don't have an interesting story to go with them...yet!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for Ami, when I was little I couldn't say my name, and the best I could do was...well, I'm sure you can guess. My mother still calls me that!</p>

          <p>Adhis found a pair of a children's glasses while slaying Tripeed Monsters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She wanted to find the owner herself, but couldn't leave her post, so instead asked you to see Karina, a child in the village, and ask her if she knew who they belonged to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Karina told you that they were actually her glasses, and gave you a small reward for returning them.</p>
