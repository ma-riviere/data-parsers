          <p>I do not, but [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nereus] has been struggling with the Balaur for quite some time now. If I were a betting woman I'd wager it has something to do with them.</p>

          <p>Regardless, now's not the time for speculation. You've been chosen for a task, and now you must prove yourself worthy of selection.</p>
