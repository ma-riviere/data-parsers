          <p>I've made up my mind. I need to ask for Sanctum's help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I dislike collaboration--too many Shugos in the deal, you understand. That said, the situation in The Scorchlands is serious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I need more information first.</p>

        <p>Flame Crystals hold concentrated Balaur energy. I've been told they're the source of Molten Blade Spirits. If that's true, it's.... Well, I have to examine their Flame Essences to be sure.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>I'm no warrior--I admit it. But the only way to get what I need is to go to The Scorchlands.</p>
          <P> </P>
         <P>Would you help me? You'd have to extinguish Molten Blade Spirits and bring their Flame Essences to me.</P>

          <p>Fire Spirits have showed up in The Scorchlands. Ankises believed he couldn't complete his research alone and wanted to ask for Sanctum's help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To do that, he needed to ensure that his information was correct: that Molten Blade Spirits really came from Flame Crystals. He asked you to kill some Spirits and get their Flame Essences for him.</p>

          <p>When you got the Flame Essences as he requested, he thanked you and paid you from his research budget. </p>
