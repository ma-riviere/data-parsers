        	<p>A wise choice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Over the years, [%userclass], as the harsh conditions have lessened here in Asmodae, I have seen greed take root within the hearts of our people. When I was young, we starved ourselves so that our brethren could eat, we exhausted ourselves so that others might sleep. It gave us heart, compassion, and a sense of unity that those sun-kissed buffoons will never understand....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My point is this: honesty and its siblings are still vital for our society, so that we may maintain our identity; the spirit that helped us survive the Cataclysm. You, my child, you are an Asmodian. Never forget that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honesty deserves reward. Take these axes. They are of little interest to me.</p>
