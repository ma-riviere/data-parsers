          <p>Psst! It's [%username], right? You've been out to Havenjark farm...I've got a proposition for you.</p>

          <p>Just between you and me, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Got any skulls from there? Or any bones at all? If they're in good shape, I'll pay top Kinah for them.</p>

          <p>Don't look at me like that! What's wrong with collecting skulls as a hobby?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I volunteered to come to Brusthonin because it has so many Undead, but I've been stuck in the campsite since I got here. Randet's orders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, [%username], I know you aren't exactly squeamish. How about heading back to Havenjark Farm and collecting some skulls? I'll pay, of course.</p>

          <p>What I really want is skulls from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GraveknightD_23_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SkeletonMagicianD_23_An]s at Havenjark farm. Will you bring me bring me some? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I'm paying for intact skulls, not a bunch of bone splinters. Understand?</p>

          <p>Okay, so maybe you're a little on the squeamish side...</p>

          <p>If you won't help, then at least do me the courtesy of not gossiping about "Tala and her macabre hobby." Not everyone is...broad-minded, I guess.</p>

          <p>There are three kinds of people I hate in this world: First, cruel gossips who just won't leave a humble Legionary alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, so-called "antiquities dealers" in Pandaemonium who sell Zombie skulls as Unfest skulls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And third: people who say they'll help you, but then don't follow through. That ring true, [%username]?</p>

          <p>These specimens are just what I wanted. Now I need only the skulls of Banshees and Boggarts, and I'll have examples of everything from Havenjark Farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where am I going to put these? Randet told me to clear my collection out of the tent, so I have them stashed outside for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's my problem, not yours, I suppose. Thanks for your help--and your discretion.</p>
