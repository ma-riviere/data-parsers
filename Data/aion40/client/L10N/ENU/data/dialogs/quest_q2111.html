          <p>Sigh.... The Captain must hate me, that's the only explanation. He gives real missions to the others but he never assigns me those sorts of jobs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On top of that, the Qooqoo cage is broken, so all the Qooqoos have escaped. Well, actually, I got angry and kicked the cage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I ran around trying to catch the Qooqoos all day long and now I'm exhausted. There's one Qooqoo left to find, but I can barely move my tired feet... [%username], will you help me?</p>
