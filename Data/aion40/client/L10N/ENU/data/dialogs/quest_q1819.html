          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen to this. I send two scouts off to the Sulfur Archipelago to see if there are any Asmodians there, and before I know it, they've been returned to the Obelisk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were killed, and do you know what got them?!</p>

          <p>Worms! They were killed by worms!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In my soldiers' defense, these are no ordinary worms. They spit acid, and they can crush a man in seconds. They're lethal, and we need to make sure they don't interfere with our reconnaissance again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone to go to the archipelago and obliterate these monstrosities. Will you undertake the task?</p>

          <p>Only one of the unfortunate scouts has regained consciousness so far, and she tells us there are hundreds of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_Worm_28_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_WormB_29_An]s at the Sulfur Flow and Sulfur Swamp.</p>

          <p>And, one last thing. Their sap is incredibly acidic. Unless you want scarred hands for the rest of your life, handle them with care.</p>

          <p>I think I'll send it to Sanctum for testing. Perhaps our scientists can find a way to use the sap against those knuckle-dragging Asmodians....</p>
