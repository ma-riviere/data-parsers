          <p>I told you last time we met that the reason I'm hiding out here is that I ran away after beating up my Lepharist boss. I hated him, and he had it coming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he's a petty little man and I'll bet he's holding a grudge.</p>

          <p>I joined the Lepharist Revolutionaries to help Atreia. I learned the truth eventually, but everybody in my home town knows I joined, so I can't go back there.</p>
