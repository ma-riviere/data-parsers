          <p>[%userclass]! See the life of a master armorsmith?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Smoke. Heat. Torrents of orders, always complicated. Hammers ringing all the bloody time. At the end of the day, fall over, then wake up and do it all again. But I have to, don't I? Can't grumble. We all do our bit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Know what I have to do today? Plate armor. With iron. I bloody hate making iron armor. But you can't whinge, I say. You just crack on.</p>

          <p>Oh, but know what you need to make blasted iron plate armor? Steel bloody ingots. And you know what you need to make steel balfired ingots? Blasted iron ore, that's what.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And who takes all the balflamed iron ore? Humans. The blasted Humans use it all up. No iron ore in Pandaemonium for love nor money. No ore? No ingots.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what's poor Kinterun to do, eh? Turn down orders? Drive up prices? With a war on? Not complaining, mind. Can't be helped. Just have to lump it.</p>

          <p>There might just be! You ever learn forge skills? If not, no matter. I can start you, and you'll knock ingots out like a champion. Three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_recipe_d_ws_001]s'd do me for now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you do, you get iron ore from wherever it's left, then refine it with my Armor Forges. Piece of cake!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's worth asking your chums if they have spare ore. Amazing what folk have down bottom of their cube....</p>

          <p>You're a right trooper, [%username]. With your help, I'll have that armor made. You just get those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_recipe_d_ws_001]s, and I'll swing the rest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Grupaks over there sells charcoal briquettes, if you need. There's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a2] all 'round Moslan Forest. Bring it here and forge ingots in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_Mail_production]. Since you're just starting, you'll make a mess of the first few before getting the knack, so best make sure you get extra iron ore.</p>
