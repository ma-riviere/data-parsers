          <p>First thing this morning, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA09] came to me asking for thirty antidote potions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He works with venomous creatures all day long, so it makes sense that he would need them, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I was thinking about all his beasts as I was collecting these bottles for him. Just a few moments ago, though, I noticed that the antidote is still here! Worse of all, the antidoze is missing!</p>

          <p>So, that's powerful stuff! It sends ordinary people into fits of laughter, after which they wind up exhausted! With all those creatures around, Geolus could be in real danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, can you go to Geolus' Campsite and give this package to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA09]? The thirty antidote potions are in here. I've made sure this time. </p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry about bringing back the antidoze. Just make sure Geolus gets the antidote potions. That's what's important.</p>

          <p>But...I can't do it myself. The shop needs looking after. And people always need a merchant. I'd be letting everyone down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aren't you worried about Geolus? What if he drinks the antidoze? He may not even check the bottle....</p>
