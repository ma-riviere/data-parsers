          <p>Yes. Very good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Cataclysm literally shaped our world. The Balaur attacked and the Tower of Eternity collapsed. This shifted the flow of Aether considerably, which created a strange rift between the two towers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was only later that we named this rift the Abyss and found it had somehow suspended vast fragments of the destroyed tower. Onto the next question....</p>

          <p>What a strange answer!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is true that the Abyss was created after the Tower of Eternity was destroyed, but its continuing presence has not adversely affected the towers since then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Try again. The question is simple enough: how does the Abyss pose a threat to Atreia?</p>

          <p>A textbook response! Our research shows that the Abyss drains Atreia of Aether. Soon our Daevas will find their powers diminished, then gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is another worry though. Siel and Israphel bound Elysea and Asmodae together with Aetheric ties, and the Abyss weakens those ties each day. If they were to fail, Elysea would drift from Asmodae and our lives would all be extinguished.</p>

          <p>Welcome to this section of your Abyss test, [%username]. I'll be finding out what you know about military operations.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>While it's true that the castle gates must be destroyed to gain entry, it's only the first step.</p>

          <p>The Guardian Generals are incredibly powerful warriors. Versed in combat since birth, their strength and resilience necessitates a well coordinated attack.</p>

          <p>However, defeat them and win the fortress. Such a prize transcends material wealth, and is crucial to our overall war effort. Time for the next question.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>While Artifacts are situated near to fortresses, capturing the latter gives its occupiers no sway over the Artifacts themselves. Each Artifact has a guardian which must be bested before control can be claimed.</p>
