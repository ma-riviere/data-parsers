          <p>Asmo was a big, strong, sharp-clawed Asmodian Daeva. One fine day in the Abyss, she met a skinny, sunburned, fancily-dressed Elyos Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"My name is Ellie," said the Elyos, "and I don't think we should fight each other. I think we should be friends!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Okay," said Asmo, smiling. "I promise I won't try to kill you."</p>

          <p>"Since we're friends now," Asmo said, "let me give you a few makeup tips."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Wow! I'd love some!" said Ellie. "I'm always looking for ways to make myself prettier!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmo handed Ellie a vial of poison powder. "Take this. It makes great lipstick."</p>

          <p>Ellie gladly took the poison powder and smeared it on her lips. She took out a mirror and admired herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You're right! I look great!" she said. And then she dropped dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmo flew to the Obelisk to wait for the stupid Elyos to come back to life. She wanted to have more fun with her.</p>

          <p>When Ellie came back to life, she waved to Asmo. "It's so good to see you again!" she said. "You're my new best friend!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Of course I am," said Asmo. "But do you see that Balaur on that island over there? I heard him say he wants to be your friend too."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Really? That's wonderful! I always wanted a Balaur friend!" And Ellie flew off to say hello to the Balaur.</p>

          <p>She flew down and landed right next to the Balaur. He looked at her in surprise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Hello, Mr. Balaur!" she said. "Will you be my friend?" In answer, the Balaur drove his axe into Ellie's skull. Her brains splattered all over the island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmo waited at the Obelisk for Ellie to come back to life. She wanted to have even more fun with her.</p>

          <p>"That Balaur wasn't a very good friend," Ellie said when she came back to life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Maybe he didn't think you looked pretty enough," said Asmo. "After all, your makeup's gone now."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But you don't need makeup to look pretty. You just need the right light. Like over there, right next to that sun."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"That's great advice! Thanks!" said Ellie, as she took wing and started flying towards the burning red sun.</p>

          <p>Asmo watched as the stupid Elyos flew off to her death. She smiled as she watched Ellie burst into flames.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She laughed and laughed at the thought of her beautiful skin being charred black. She waited by the Obelisk for Ellie to come back to life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Ellie had flown too far out from the Obelisk. Her soul would be banished forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmo could have no more fun with her.</p>
