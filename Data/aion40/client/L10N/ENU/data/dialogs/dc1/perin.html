          <p>Do you think love can last forever? I mean really forever...Daeva forever? I used to. A couple can fall in love, promise to spend the rest of their lives together, and then.... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even after several lifetimes of togetherness, it only takes an instant for one of them to change their mind. Or turn their head...</p>

          <p>I have. Fjorgin was my reason for being. Just her name used to bring me such joy. Now...pain. Ironically, she's a Soul Healer, but she's not doing much good for mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No. Our time has passed. The love of a Daeva can't last a lifetime, when that lifetime is eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sorry for troubling you with this. But it's helped me to clear my mind. Things always seem worse when unshared, don't they?</p>
