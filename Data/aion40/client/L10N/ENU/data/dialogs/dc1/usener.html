          <p>How did I become a master craftsman? Well, my family were merchants, but I was never interested in business. I always liked to make things with my hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Weapons especially fascinated me, as a practical art. One must make a sword functional, keen, well-balanced, strong, but also beautiful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was also proud to do something to help us win the war. I've since come to specialize in restoring magic swords like...Agrif's Rage.</p>

          <p>It's is a very powerful magic weapon created by my master Agrif for the victory of Asmodae, after his family was slaughtered by Elyos.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>But his grief and anger were so powerful that it bound to the sword and inhabits anyone who wields it.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>That's why an Empyrean Lord sundered the weapon and sealed its power away.</P>
