          <p>Let me give you a bit of advice, Daeva. The Shugos may be useful, but whatever you do, don't trust them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's only one reason they're here at all. Kinah. The moment you cease to be a source of income for them, you may as well not exist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish prosperity on everyone I deal with, but there are more important things. Health and happiness, for a start.</p>
