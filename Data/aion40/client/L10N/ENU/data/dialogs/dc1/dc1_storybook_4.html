          <p>A new era is beginning. Once, we Humans thought of ourselves as the only worthwhile race, others being either cowards unwilling to stand up to the Balaur or evil beasts worshipping them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have come to realize that there is much to be admired about other races. The Mau in particular have proven at times to be brave, noble allies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To further our understanding of these magnificent felines, I offer the legend of Zemurru, the Mau hero who united the tribes. Read his story, and you shall see that the Mau are more noble than you may have thought.</p>

          <p>Even as a child, Zemurru was extraordinary. He handled all weapons with the skill of a champion. His strength was such that he could uproot trees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His piercing blue eyes captivated the other Mau, and even the fierce and wild Tayga.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he came of age, he received a dream. In this dream, a voice told him, "go out into the world and do your work." That morning, Zemurru left his village carrying only a staff and some meat wrapped in a leaf.</p>

          <p>In his travels Zemurru came across Mau from all the many tribes. In that age the Mau were disorganized, nomadic--most enslaved under Balaur dominion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zemurru bared his teeth in anger at the suffering he saw across the land. The Balaur bent his people to their whims, flogging and starving them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On a hill of power, Zemurru swore that he would free his people. He swore he would unify the Mau.</p>

          <p>Zemurru went to all the tribes and met with all the chieftains. He called a secret meeting in the Cave of Winds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though the chieftains bared their fangs and snarled at each other, Zemurru stopped their quarrels. He made them see the suffering of the Mau under the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All the chieftains signed a pact of alliance, to share knowledge and fight together. All the Mau tribes became united in the Mau Nation.</p>

          <p>Zemurru and the warriors of the Mau Nation led bold raids on the Balaur. They freed many enslaved Mau, and killed many Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legends of the blue-eyed freedom-bringer inspired many more slaves. They rose up against the Balaur, fled to freedom, to join Zemurru's army.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Balaur knew they were beaten they sent a messenger to Zemurru. They would free all the Mau, said the messenger, and there would be peace. Zemurru agreed, for he had seen to the messenger's heart with his blue eyes and knew he did not lie.</p>

          <p>It was also Zemurru who took the Skurvs under his protection. Zemurru was wise--he knew that the Skurvs grew many medicinal plants, but were too weak to fight other races.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zemurru convinced the Skurvs to live under the protection of the Mau. The Skurvs would cultivate plants for the Mau, and the Mau would keep the Skurvs safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To this day the Mau and the Skurvs are closest allies.</p>

          <p>Not all the chieftains agreed with Zemurru. Some of them plotted against him with the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are two versions of the story of Zemurru's death. Some say he died in a Balaur ambush, others that he was poisoned. What is certain is that he was betrayed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Zemurru's body burned on the funeral pyre, the Mau chieftains, unable to agree, went their separate ways. The Mau Nation was no more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But all good-hearted Mau still remember Zemurru.</p>
