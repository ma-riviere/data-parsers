          <p>I like to walk through the city on my own when it's quiet. It's more than just a city to me...to us. Pandaemonium represents our highest achievements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See these walls? They stand strong and tall now, but once were constructed on burning ashes and death. We Asmodians are equally strong and tall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were faced with annihilation, balanced on the brink of extinction, and yet we found an inner strength in ourselves and in each other...we adapted, evolved, and survived. Now we are a beautiful people...divine in our compassion and comprehension.</p>

          <p>Yes, that's the spirit! I do ramble on sometimes...</p>

          <p>So, back to the city. You know the Elyos have a city of their own? They've created a floating palace somehow, and use it to sing their petty praises for their cowardly Lords.</p>

          <p>One day we'll see it. One day we'll crush it.</p>
