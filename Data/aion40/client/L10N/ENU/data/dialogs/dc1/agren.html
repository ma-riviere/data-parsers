           <p>Look at me! 'bout as wide as I am tall, these days. Not putting on weight though, nope--just got my pockets crammed with refining stones. You know, the ones everyone and their Brax is after?</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>Course, I could sell some to you, but I haven't got millions. If you want to take a look at my wares, I'll see if I can spare a few....</p>
           <p> </p>
           <p>If I'm out of what you're after, I'm afraid you'll just have to wait until I waddle back from the stockroom.</p>
