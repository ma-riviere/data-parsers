          <p>So many Daevas drone on and on about their weapons. They forget about armor, about protecting themselves. What good's a weapon without someone to use it? They have grown too used to immortality, too reliant on the obelisks. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They forget all the Daevas who perished in the Abyss long ago. There is a lesson to be learned. Perhaps with better armor, they would at least have had a greater chance of surviving.</p>
