          <p>1. From Ishalgen to Beluslan the seven Mau tribes roam. Divided by their loyalties and driven from their homes.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Some have joined the Balaur, some stay proud and strong. Some can trace their lineage to Zemurru.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>The Red Mane and the Silver Mane retain their warrior pride. All the other modern tribes have joined the other side.</p>

          <p>2. The Ancient Mau were three in name--Eyebrow, Claw and Mane. Zemurru was their leader, and doused the Balaur's flame.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Upon his death his children left, coloring their Manes--Grey, Red and Silver became their tribal names.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Liagathan, his wife in life, returned to hearth and kin. The Mist Mane Mau returned to matriarchal ways again.</p>

          <p>3. Zemurru's peace did chafe and bite the Claw while he did live. First to leave, they jumped for scraps the Balaur lords would give. </p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Ice Claw split from Black Claw when the Cataclysm came. The Artifact offered power if their natures they could tame.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Eyebrow Mau retreated with magic none could match. Now they are the Hoarfrost Mau and none can find their tracks.</p>

          <p>4. Grey Mane Mau and Dundun Skurv hold hatred in their hearts. The son of Zemurru's second wife taught them all their parts.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Together in Dubaro they hunt and work the fields. Odella Plantation and Canyon walls act as mighty Shields.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>When the Balaur asked they answered, and still they heed the call. The Millennium War still rages where Gray Mane footsteps fall.</p>

          <p>5. Zemurru rests in Altgard--many relics bear his name. The Black Claw Mau and MuMu Skurv have prospered since his day.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Through Mahindel and swamp-filled paths, the Black Claw outpost lies. West past Moslan Fortress the MuMu tribe resides.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Daevas count their steps nearby, the Balaur taint is strong. Though other tribes have fallen, the Black Claw Mau live on.</p>

          <p>6. Beyond the great Salt Desert the Munmun Skurv lands lie. Side by side with Ice Claw Mau the farmer's trade they ply.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Beneath Black Dragon banner, the Mist Mane Mau make war. Flashing spears and tearing claws, servants of Balaur.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>But Morheim's lands are occupied by one last noble tribe. The indignities they suffered are terrible to describe.</p>

          <p>7. Zemurru's sons are Red and Grey, but his daughter's Mane was Silver. Beaten, battered, they still hunt on, flowing like a river.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>His heart beats strong, his blood is theirs, though Mist Mane Mau would spill it. </p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>With the BuBu tribe they hide and heal until revenge beginneth.</p>

          <p>8. In Beluslan the Red Mane dwell--their numbers are diminished. </p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>The Hoarfrost hide, with wounded pride, their tale is almost finished.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Both tribes live with heads held high, fiercely independent. Though Balaur seek, they cannot find this last defiant remnant.</p>

          <p>9. Zemurru's wives and children are his legacy of war. His marriages were powerful, though few could count the score.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Three had children, one did not--most tribes live apart. When Mist and Silver Manes do meet, revenge becomes an art.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>But progeny are not to blame, in truth the cause is simple. Asmodians caused their tragic war by forcing them to mingle.  </p>

          <p>10. Only so much land remained to feed the hungry tribes. In Morheim they were pressed too close, and tempers soon would rise.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>A Daeva's blade ignited them, though only one tribe fought. The Balaur taint runs strong and deep, our hatred burns so hot.</p>
					<p> </p> 
					<p>Ancient ways and better days are all the Mau have left. This concludes our history, our future is bereft.</p>
