          <p>What is it? What brings you to me? Have you not heard the news, fledgling? Kasir is not to be trusted. He is a vagabond. A liar. A traitor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know what you want, and I can't provide it. The Hidden Library's doors are locked, and will not open...not yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Run along now. If others see you with me, you'll be painted with the same muck they throw so at me. Whispering cowards, every last one of them.</p>
