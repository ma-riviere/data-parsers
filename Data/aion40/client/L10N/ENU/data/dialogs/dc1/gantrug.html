          <p>Can I ask you something?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think life is all about? What do Humans live for? What meaning can an immortal Daeva find in his eternal life?</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>These questions...they prey upon me. I feel like I have to find out the real meaning of life--but at the same time, I'm terrified. I worry my life will turn out to have been meaningless.</p>
