          <p>If you met him, you'd know him. He left to Morheim to go try and get some stock together for a business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"What business can you ever run?" I asked him. He'd make a terrible shopkeeper. But that didn't stop him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hasn't sent any word. I hope he's okay. I'd hate to have that be our last conversation ever....</p>
