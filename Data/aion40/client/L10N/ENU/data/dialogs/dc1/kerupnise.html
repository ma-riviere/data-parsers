          <p>Weapons and armor must be strong. But they should also suit their owner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can modify a weapon's appearance easily. A sword should fit the hand and never slip...especially in battle. The trick is to know your weapon, how it fits you, and when it doesn't. The modifications I make not only alter the appearance of a weapon but also increase its power.</p>
