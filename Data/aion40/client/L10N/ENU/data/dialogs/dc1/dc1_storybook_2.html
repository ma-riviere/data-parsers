          <p>Compiler's Note: Hild, Daeva of Time and Space, perished in the Abyss before finishing his definitive research on the area. This book is a compilation of his last diary entries, dated by the month, week and day of the expedition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since Hild's time, we have learned far more about the Abyss, thanks mainly to the efforts and sacrifices of many courageous Archons. However, Hild's record is still valuable and relevant today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a testament to the courage of those who brave the unknown for the sake of Asmodae. As you turn these pages in comfort and safety, think of Hild and his companions and respect the ordeals they underwent.</p>

          <p>1-2-4: How long has this battle raged? I cannot tell...too much has happened. Still reeling from the discovery of Elysea, we are beset by legions of Elyos screaming "revenge, revenge for Deltras."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only a handful of us survived the first expedition...now we find ourselves thrust into a war. Whether our research has any future at all, I cannot tell. This place makes a mockery of all my predictions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole realm defies imagination. If we cannot face it armed with knowledge, we will wield courage instead. We are Asmodians, bending the knee to none, laughing in the face of that which would destroy us.</p>

          <p>1-3-5: The flow of Aether is extraordinarily unstable today. We know from experience that exploring under these conditions is hazardous, so we have decided to take a day off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The unscheduled break has raised our spirits. Many Archons are writing letters to their families, and I am reminded of the day when we first discovered the opening...the gate to the other dimension, which we came to call the Abyss. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Crowds gathered to hear us speak, excitedly talking of the new possibilities. But some of the older Daevas, those who remembered the Cataclysm, were troubled. I wonder now...could they, with their powers in full maturity, sense dangers we could not?</p>

          <p>2-1-2: I cannot rid my mind of these thoughts. The first Daevas through the gate were often trapped here, perishing miserably far from home. Will that be my fate?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am alive, for now; but there is no Obelisk here, no escape from death. Pandaemonium is working on the 'kisk', and the others are keen to hear more of it. Nobody here wishes to be thought a coward, so we do not discuss it much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Compiler's Note: In the time of Hild, these early experiments were dismal failures. The Kisk was not perfected until long after the outbreak of the Elyos-Asmodian war.</p>

          <p>2-3-2: Today we discovered a place that can only be described as amazing. An island in the void, with trees, wide open fields, and abundant fresh water. A fragment of ancient Atreia, and in the midst of it all was an object with a strong Aetheric force!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When approached, it emanates deep sounds like those of a gong sounded below the earth. Why have we not encountered such a thing before? This discovery excites me beyond words. Since the war began, we have made only sluggish progress. I have asked the Legion to claim it for the Asmodian people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Compiler's Note: The place described matches the region named Lake Asteria. We now know the mysterious object to be an Artifact.</p>

          <p>3-1-1: Our expedition has been cut short. A messenger arrived minutes ago with a report of Archons returning to the fortress after encountering a strange creatures resembling a Balaur more than anything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is not the first time we have been ordered back to safety, but something here feels deeply wrong. Could these creatures really be related to the Balaur? The others are packing their belongings, and while nobody will say it, the mood here is thick and black.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Compiler's Note: The unknown creatures later proved to be Draconutes, a subspecies of Balaur.</p>

          <p>7-3-6. It's been months since our research was put on hold, and at last there is hope of resuming the expedition. Our Archons are beating back the Elyos in droves, and today we received formal word that we could return to our studies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are heading into hardship and tribulation, but our hearts are light, for this is what we were born to do. I asked the cooks to pay special attention to tonight's feast, as it may be the last one we share for some time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Marchutan, Lord of Fate, decreed that we should be men and women of learning, not warriors. As we prepare to step once more into the unknown, I place my trust in his decision, and accept the trials he chose for us gladly.</p>
