          <p> </p>
          <p>You carry the weight of the Asmodian people on your wings. Their blood flows in your veins, their hearts beat in your breast. Legions of Elyos and massed ranks of Balaur gather at our door, and it is you who must push them back.</p>

          <p>The Shedim Lords have chosen your blood to represent us, my friend. Do not disappoint them.</p>
