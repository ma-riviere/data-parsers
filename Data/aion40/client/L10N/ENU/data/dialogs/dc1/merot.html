          <p>Maybe you can talk some sense into Momorena. The Shugos are a shifty, secretive lot--don't you agree?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was just saying, I'm certain they must be smuggling things from the Abyss. How else can they get paws on such rare and exotic items?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Course, Momorena here thinks Shugos are just cuddly toys.</p>
