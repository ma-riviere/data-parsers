          <p>The other girls used to tease me for reading books. They said it was weird for a girl to be reading all day instead of chasing after boys.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think books are way more interesting than the real world. I read fantasy novels mostly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd much rather read fantastic stories about riding on horses or driving cars than some boring book about Daeva fighting Balaur.</p>
