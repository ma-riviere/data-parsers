          <p>The flames, always moving, glowing softly...so soothing. Even before I ascended, I could see their beauty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a child, the sight of them would lull me to sleep. The moment I ascended, I apprenticed myself to Master Kinterun, determined to learn all there was to know about Armorsmithing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's in the past now. I have moved on--armor's just not my thing.</p>

          <p>Master Kinterun noticed my affinity with fire was far greater than my skill with metal. Now I supervise this furnace, a far more complicated task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not as simple as it sounds. The temperature of the flames has to be adjusted according to whichever metal is being smelted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've finally found my place, and couldn't be happier.</p>
