          <p>The Shadow Court is the strong arm of Asmodae, separate and superior to the military and the temples. Independence guarantees integrity and purity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our sole purpose is to eliminate corruption and treachery in our people. Alliance to a particular aspect of Asmodian life only complicates matters. True strength is not in our individual ability, but in that of the Daeva to either side of us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We survived the Cataclysm by working together, and we are now the most feared fighting force in all of Atreia. Remember our strengths, [%username]. They will serve you well.</p>
