          <p>If it weren't for the cowardice and dithering of the Elyos, Aion would never have been sundered.</p>

          <p>The Balaur must be cut down where they stand, of course. But the Elyos--they're the greatest danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least you know where you stand with the Balaur: it's kill or be killed. But our ancestors were fooled too often by the honeyed words of those who now call themselves Elyos.</p>

          <p>To a young Daeva like you, the Millennium War exists only in library tomes and tavern tales. The Daevas and Humans swallowed by that war can't tell the story themselves. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They must rely on us to avenge them--by bringing justice to the true traitors! The five Empyrean Lords of the Elyos--I suppose they call themselves "Seraphim Lords" now--have blood on their hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their attempt to negotiate with the Balaur was an act of treason. Atreia is dying as we speak, and the only way to save it is to bring those traitors to justice. Blood for blood!</p>
