          <p>The day I became a Shadow Executor was special. I remember blinking back the tears when they told me I had been accepted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't stand corruption. It's a sickness that grips so many of our people. Makes me feel ill just thinking about it. To be given the chance to help stamp it out is an honor--the greatest of honors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are two methods, of course: prevention and punishment. I hope you never find yourself tangled up in either of them.</p>
