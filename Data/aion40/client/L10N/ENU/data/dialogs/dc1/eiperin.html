          <p>Let me tell you something you won't hear from many others. All Daevas are NOT created equal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think what you want of me, but it's true. It's a simple fact, no matter if you acknowledge it or not. How can a Daeva who ascended yesterday be the equal of one who has served Pandaemonium for hundreds of years?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva who comes from a family that has served Pandaemonium for generations is clearly better than a Daeva from a bunch of peasants. I'm only saying what everyone really thinks.</p>
