          <p>I just can't settle in, though. The work is easy enough, but....</p>

          <p>I make pretty good Kinah, but after I buy food there's barely anything left. It's not like I stuff myself or anything. It's just really expensive to live in the big city!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back home you could get a Qooqoo cheap, and you'd know the guy who sold it to you. Here they charge you what they think they can get away with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I go home, at least I'll be able to eat well.</p>
