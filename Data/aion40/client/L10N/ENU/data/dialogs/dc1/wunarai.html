          <p>It's been two months since my pilgrimage to the Great Temple. Long enough for most people to see everything, but not for me. Ever since I arrived here, I've wanted to stay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't see any way I can go back to my hometown. I feel like part of the city, another of its landmarks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've enough Kinah for now, but what'll I do when it runs out? No one becomes a pilgrim for the glamorous lifestyle, you know.</p>
