          <p>My friend,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard you had been digging around for information on Fenris's Fangs. I found this little journal a few years back, and figured it might be of interest to you.</p>

          <p>(The top of this first page has been ruined by water. You start reading halfway down the page's length.)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...much to remember! Thought I should write everything down. I just hope this is allowed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As with everything, it seems preparation is the first step towards my goal. I must prepare for a ceremony, but how? I asked Brakan, the Daeva of Fortunetelling, to help. He suggested I find "the Wise" and pointed me towards Kanensa, the Daeva of Wind. I'll go after lunch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: I spoke to Kanensa a moment ago, and she accidentally let slip that she could carry out a Fangs ceremony for me! I twisted her arm with a divine lamp, and she agreed. Progress!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: Now it seems I must choose a faith. A faith for what? Regardless, I spoke to my Class Preceptor Freyr, who had heard of my application (how?), and he said that while preparations for my ceremony were almost complete, my "Divinity" was not sufficient. Did he mean my Divine Power? I'm on duty tonight, so I'll make extra sure to keep those Twiggies back. Hopefully that'll do it.</p>

          <p>Oh! So much to write about! Years fly by with barely a page's worth of updates, then in two days I have enough to write a book! Honestly....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My ceremony is done! But as my ascension ceremony was the final stage of my becoming a Daeva, this ceremony is just the first of many steps. Captain Kvasir--CAPTAIN KVASIR!--contacted me regarding my application, and told me I'd need recommendation letters from all my Preceptors. Wasn't easy, but it was done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next I was sent to the High Priest for a ritual. I was told to bring some holy water with me, which took an age to find. Dinner, then sleep. I'm exhausted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>NOTE TO SELF -- BRING GLASSES TOMORROW. LOTS TO READ.</p>

          <p>Oh, my head.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today I had to speak to the Fang's informers. Only thing is, the informers--being informers--weren't exactly easy to find. I was given a list of names and rough locations, and obviously had to keep my own profile as low as possible. I think this is all part of a test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I did it. Found all eight, then had another purification ritual. More holy water--good thing that accessories place was still open.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bed now. More tomorrow.</p>

          <p>This is more like it! Captain Kvasir just called on me a minute ago as I was getting suited up, and told me to sharpen my polearm!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: I was taken out to Brusthonin and told to kill monsters. Seems some poor fool had been sent round planting tokens on them, and it was my task to retrieve thirty of them. Easy. No problem. After that, another purification ritual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: Funny how menial tasks are so exhausting, but actual work just...invigorates me! Been lying in bed for hours now, and still my eyes are dancing crimson. Too much energy. Too much excitement.</p>

          <p>Crafting! They want me to craft! Haha! Fortunately I'm something of an artisan blacksmith and was able to speak to Kinterun about the special assignment Captain Kvasir mentioned. Burned the back of my hand, but ended up with a Hot Heart of Magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next I had to take it to Pandaemonium's Master Craftsman, who validated its quality and enchanted an insignia with its power. Guess who got to keep the insignia? ME!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: Another purification ritual! It's a wonder the Fangs have the time to actually fight. This time they wanted a different kind of holy water though. Not a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: Can't sleep again. Think I'm getting near the end now.</p>

          <p>Two days of nothing, and just when I thought they had forgotten about me, I'm handed a new task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today I had to go and extract 20 Lights of Luck, crystals that were once part of the Tower of Eternity, but now lie all over Atreia. These crystals are notoriously hard to gather, so I had to first pay a visit to Relir and rent a special tool from him. Three point four million Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I looked in Ishalgen and Altgard and found nothing. (The text here has been smudged heavily) both fine though, and I was done before the storms came rolling in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Update: Guess what? Returned the tool to Relir and then.... PURIFICATION RITUAL!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I just finished my final task. I had to kill Brohums in Brusthonin, the Defenders on the Divine Floating Island, and then had to sneak onto the Dredgion and kill Captain Adhati! When that was all done, I had to (smudged text) then went to Captain Kvasir with that mysteriously glowing holy water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've just been given my Fang weapon. It's beautiful, and somehow...somehow I can feel it protecting me. This is incredible!</p>
