          <p>We're sharding proud of our work. I make weapons that'll outlast a Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva weapons have to be reliable, beautiful to look at, properly balanced...companions, not just tools. Small wonder many of us give our weapons names, eh? They stand with us when everything else is lost.</p>

          <p>A weapon's not just a tool...it's a companion...possibly for life. A Daeva needs to trust their weapon completely. If a broken weapon gets them killed...then their blood is on my hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Weapon making is serious work. We don't do things halfway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you are called upon to forge weapons for your comrades, do it with your whole heart.</p>
