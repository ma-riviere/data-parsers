          <p>When I'm with Ellon, I feel like we could play for the Shedim Lords themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that I belittle my own talents. It's just that we work so well together.... Instrument and voice, like sword and shield, each lesser without the other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am truly blessed by Aion to have such a partner.</p>

          <p>I have found the perfect musical mate in Ellon. He is why I am actually here in Pandaemonium, performing for Daevas. He is why I can reach my full potential as a musician.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, he is a Daeva, and I a Human, so I know our partnership must end in time. But I am not concerned. It's why I married and started a family, after all.</p>

          <p>I may not live forever, but my name and talent can. When I have children, Ellon and I will teach them music. Then I will have them teach their children, and their children teach theirs, and so on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For as long as Ellon lives, he will have one of my line to accompany him. That way, our melodies will ring throughout the ages as long as there are Asmodian ears to hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And who knows? Perhaps one of my children or descendants will ascend. Then our legacy will be fully guaranteed.</p>
