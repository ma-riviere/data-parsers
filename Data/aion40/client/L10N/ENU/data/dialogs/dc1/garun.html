          <p>A Legion's emblem is more than just a picture. The enemy doesn't speak our language, so your emblem has to project the Legion's whole character in one symbol.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why our Legions invest so much time and effort in their emblems. They can inspire fear, respect, and many other things. Each Legion is different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course we can't authorize emblems for just any Legion. The members have to prove themselves first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When a Legion reaches level 2, it can change its emblem. And at level 3, it can register an emblem that the members have made themselves.</p>

          <p>Was I not clear enough? Not every Legion can change its emblem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only a Legion whose achievements have been formally recognized by Pandaemonium can do so.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to achieve more as a Legion to be eligible to change your emblem. When you have more experience, we can talk again.</p>
