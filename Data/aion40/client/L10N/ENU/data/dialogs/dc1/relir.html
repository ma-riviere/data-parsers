          <p>Have you learned much about Essencetapping?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no Daeva, but I've seen [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Latatusk] Essencetapping more times than I can remember! That's how I came to be here, actually.</p>

          <p>You probably expected a Shugo behind this counter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm happy to be here! Even if it's long hours, being a Human in Pandaemonium is a blessing. Just being alive is a blessing and it's all because of Latatusk. Latatusk saved my life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau attacked my village, hunting down anyone they could see...man, woman or child. All my friends and family are dead at their hands. I took shelter in a nearby forest for five days, without food or water. If Latatusk hadn't found me....</p>

          <p>It was pure luck. He only came by where I had hidden because he was looking for Azpha.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He nursed me back to health, and brought me back to Pandaemonium. For a long time I was too weak even to thank him. But now, now I spend all my energy trying to repay him. I help him in whatever ways I can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You Daevas are immortal. Can you understand how grateful I am? I almost died once, and I don't intend to repeat the experience for some time.</p>
