        <p>A Natural History of Useful Plants in Asmodae Gi-Ki, by Ulgibbons who returned to the Aether after dining on suspicious fungi, may he sleep in darkness...</p>

          <p>Ginseng</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ginseng is a rare plant, usually found wild in dense woodlands. Cultivation was once thought impossible, until the Skurv--who excel at farming and herb-growing--succeeded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cultivated ginseng is smaller and less potent, but more easily obtained. The Skurv keep their secret methods to themselves, but even if they were unveiled, it's doubtful that any but the Skurv could use them successfully.</p>

          <p>Ginseng: Properties</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ginseng absorbs Aether from the soil through its roots. It flourishes in places where the Aether concentration is too strong for other plants to grow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The stem sends forth long leaves resembling palm fronds. The fruits are sour and red. Older ginseng has thick roots that resemble the Human form; some say it screams when it is pulled from the ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best way to absorb the Aether concentrated in the roots is to chew them raw, as cooking reduces their potency. Taken orally, the root tastes both sweet and slightly bitter.</p>

          <p>Ginseng: Classifications</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wild ginseng root is the most highly prized. Accumulated Aether creates a tough skin and strong odor, making it inedible. It is commonly used in medicine, or to make magical items requiring a strong concentration of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cultivated ginseng makes up the majority of the ginseng trade. Of moderate value, mild smell and adequate Aether content, it is well suited for use in food and medicine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Fresh' ginseng is a new strain, cultivated by the Skurv for growth in humid environments. Its taste and smell are comparable to cultivated ginseng, but its Aether content and resale value are low.</p>

          <p>Ginseng: The Saam</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When ginseng has accumulated Aether beyond a certain level, it turns into a creature capable of independent movement and very basic thought processes. These animated ginseng roots are called "Saam."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Saam are feeble and of low intelligence. Their arms and legs are loose and wobbly. Saam were extremely rare until the Cataclysm. Now it is common to find Saam wherever ginseng grows.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Saam emerging from cultivated ginseng fields do not live as long as wild Saam. The former live about one year, while the latter can last from one hundred to one thousand years. Most are timid, though hundred-year-old Saam tend to be aggressive, and often attack Humans and Daeva without provocation.</p>

          <p>Grobule</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Grobule is a very rare plant found primarily in Beluslan. Alchemists have found the plant's leaves to be very useful in crafting potions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans are warned to not eat the plant directly as their are toxins that must be processed out. </p>

          <p>Hasia</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is very little of the Hasia flower that goes unused. Hasia leaves and stems are cultivated for their alchemical uses. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The blooms are cut and used in a variety of floral arrangements. The xylem of the stems transport fluids more rapidly than other cut flowers. Therefore cut Hasia flowers will rapidly change color to match the fluids they are placed in.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>It has been rumored that Abyss combatants dye cut Hasia a brilliant red color by using their enemy's blood, but this researcher doubts that claim. Having tried with my own blood, I find it is far too thick for the narrow xylem to transport.</p>
