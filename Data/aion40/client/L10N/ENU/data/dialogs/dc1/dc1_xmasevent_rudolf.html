          <p>People mostly see the Solorius as a chance to socialize and flirt. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Originally, though, it was a day of thanks, dedicated to celebrating the Empyrean Lords who watch over us. If not for them, we would be under the control of the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you're looking for your soulmate around here, be sure to take some time out to focus on our Empyrean Lords and what they've done for us.</p>
