          <p>Why are some Daeva so shy, darling? It's important to have confidence in ourselves, and our clothing shows others that we have confidence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a sad state of affairs when all the Daevas in Pandaemonium walk about in their drab armor. The clothing I design represents the wishes and desires of the individual. It's not just fashion, it's expression!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any Daeva wearing my designs can walk around Pandaemonium with the utmost confidence.</p>
