          <p>Hm. Okay, nothing to ship. Yep, things are tough all over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember that Shugo scandal? The merchant who was supplying tainted food wriggled his furry way out of it without so much as a slapped wrist! The union cut off trade with them over it--we wouldn't ferry so much as a single crateload.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Things were really bad for a while, but we had principles in those days. Now, it's much harder to say no to their business.</p>
