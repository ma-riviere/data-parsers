          <p>Are you lost, friend? No trouble. Pandaemonium is a big city and it takes a while to learn your way around. If you head east from here you'll come to Pandaemonium Plaza.</p>

          <p>The lift platform behind me will take you over to the Crandale District. It lets you off right by the Apellbine Tavern. That place can be a little rough, but if you're looking for fun it's the best tavern in the city.</p>
