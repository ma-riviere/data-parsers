          <p>I was hurt, you see. I never wanted to fall in love again, promised myself I would stay single. But love has a way of drawing me in. And always to someone who will cause me pain!</p>

          <p>I know now she was just using me. It wasn't me she loved, it was my Kinah.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>Anything she wanted, I would buy for her. Shoes, jewelry...whatever she desired. And she desired a great deal. Then, the moment the money ran out, so did she.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was determined not to make the same mistake again, but...I just can't help myself.</p>

          <P>She's from the Vanahal District, and she won't let anyone forget it. Mention her name to anyone in Pandaemonium, and they'll tell you the same thing: keep away.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone advised me against pursuing her. They all said that she would hurt me, that she is so arrogant, she should have been born in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what can I do? It's just like before. I can't stop thinking about her. Even after all I've been through, I would gladly give her every last Kinah I have.</p>
