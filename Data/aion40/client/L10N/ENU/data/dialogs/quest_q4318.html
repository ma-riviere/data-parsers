          <p>Come to train as a hunter, tadpole? An old Asmodian proverb tells us that progress is not a matter of skill, but of dedication.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>True hunters must learn to purge themselves of fear to become dedicated to a cause. As Daeva we have lost much of our fear of death, but some of that fear still remains from our Human heritage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Courage is but one notch in the hunter's belt. Now we will discuss judgment, which can lead us to realize our full potential even in the face of danger.</p>

          <p>A hunter does not fear, tadpole. Know that if you bear that mantle, all traces of fear from your Human heritage have been purged.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We risk our lives to defeat foul beasts, and through that we can learn to use our best judgment in dangerous situations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Slay [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CatosD_26_An]s, and you will be one step closer to becoming a true hunter.</p>

          <p>Excellent, tadpole. Confidence is one facet of courage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, hunt 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CatosD_26_An]s. If it is too easy, think of ways to make it more challenging. Don't use a weapon, close your eyes or take on several of the beasts at the same time.</p>

          <p>How went the hunt, tadpole? Did you slay the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CatosD_26_An]s? Have you faced your fears?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Animals have intense survival instincts, perhaps even greater than those of Humans. Though animals feel fear just like Humans, when their survival is at risk their courage is palpable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To fight a cornered beast is to fight a creature without fear.</p>
