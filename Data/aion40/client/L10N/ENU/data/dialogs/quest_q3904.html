          <p> </p>
          <p>There are books that contain the skills of Lady Yustiel and other Daevas who followed her, such as this Esoteric Book of Life.</p>
          <p> </p>
					<p>I borrowed this one recently and I need to return it. Such tomes are carefully entrusted to those who carry them.</p>

          <p>The Esoteric Books of Life are kept by Thrasymedes in Protectors Hall. This particular volume covers our elementary mysteries.</p>

          <p>I assure you, [%username], that this particular book holds nothing new for you. You've mastered it already.</p>

          <p>Thrasymedes keeps the other volumes safe. Only the chosen may learn those secrets.</p>

          <p>I fear you misunderstand. The book is important, true, but it is not the only reason I wanted to see you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really wanted you to meet Thrasymedes. He's not merely the steward of our Esoteric Books of Life, he instructs a few in our deepest mysteries.</p>

          <p>Ah. The Esoteric Books of Life are the result of centuries of focused study and contemplation.</p>
