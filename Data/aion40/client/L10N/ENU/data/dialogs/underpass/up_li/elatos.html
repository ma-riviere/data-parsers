          <p>Shhhh, [%username].... You'll set the Centurion on another tirade....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The higher-ups haven't been pleased with our progress in Silentera Canyon. It's understandable, but there's not much we can do against the massive Jotuns, not to mention the Balaur...and the Asmodians. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're outnumbered on all fronts. I think at this point it'll take an onslaught of brave Daevas to control the whole canyon. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But recruiting such Daevas isn't easy. I mean, who wants to spend all their Kinah paying homage to the Soul Healer? </p>
