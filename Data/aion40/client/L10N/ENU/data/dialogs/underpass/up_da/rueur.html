          <p>C...c-c-c-curious as to how I w-w-w-wound up here? It's kind of am-m-m-musing.... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was on watch in Pandaemonium, and as is c-c-c-common around mid-shift...I fell asleep behind a p-p-p-pile of crates....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Turns out the Commander knew about these n-n-n-napping habits of mine, so he had me tucked into a crate and shipp-p-p-ped off to Balaurea! I woke up here, and have been here ever s-s-since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The C-c-c-commander must have figured that I w-w-w-wouldn't fall asleep on w-w-w-watch with the Elyos breathing down my neck. I guess he was right--I haven't s-s-s-slept in a week!</p>
