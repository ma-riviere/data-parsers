          <p>Have you seen the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_ElementalFire2_40_An]s around here, [%username]? They may look similar to the Fire Spirits we have back home in Elysea, but I assure you, they are entirely different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Watch their movements and perhaps you'll see. The energy they emit is more unpredictable than their Elyos counterparts, and they seem to be more prone to violent outbursts than other Spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I were to hazard a guess why, I would probably look at the nearby remains of the Petralith.</p>

          <p>Not enough, unfortunately. What we do know is based on little more than legend and extremely limited research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, it certainly seems to affect the nearby species, and while we cannot move the Petralith, we can try and cull the number of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_ElementalFire2_40_An]s here.</p>

          <p>Even with the Balaur about, Daeva. We must balance our priorities, you see.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>A battle won against the Balaur may well grant us control over these lands, but if we take our eyes off the native species, they'll overrun the whole area. Then what have we won?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have several Daevas ready to attack, but now I need someone to deal with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_ElementalFire2_40_An]s. What would you say if I were to offer you the job, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Centurion Menelaus came for me a moment ago actually, and was breathing fire and spitting acid, as usual. The sooner the problem with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_ElementalFire2_40_An]s is sorted out, the sooner he gets off my back.</p>
