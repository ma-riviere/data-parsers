          <p>The guard on Roah Fortress has only been getting stronger. I was sent there to scout because I was told somebody had kindly eliminated the garrison for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I got there, I just barely avoided running straight into the elite garrison that took their place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no weakling, but I'll admit I don't think I can take on an entire elite garrison by myself.</p>

          <p>Each soldier should carry a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2810a]. Bring them back to me. And tell your friends to do the same.</p>
