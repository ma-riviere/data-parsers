          <p>[%username], may I ask you a question?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it wrong to expect gratitude when a job is well done? Should I spend years perfecting my alchemical understanding, then receive nothing for sharing it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not too much to ask, is it?</p>

          <p>It's just that I remember when it was different.</p>

          <p>When my elders taught me, I'd gather food for them, or pay them with my meager possessions. But now, people expect teaching for nothing!</p>

          <p>When I see a young [%userclass] standing before me, I wonder if they also want me to impart my knowledge without giving anything in return.</p>

          <p>Perhaps. Let's see if you can back up your words.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it happens, I've just run out of Lesser Elemental Water, which I need for a number of low level potions. I'd like you to provide me with some.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Now, a quick lesson. Elemental Water must be purified from other, baser substances. Bring the unrefined materials here. All the tools you need to refine them are on the tables in this very room!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the case of Lesser Elemental Water, you must gather Lesser Elemental Stones and purify them here. The stones are created as a natural by-product of digestion. You should find them in the bellies of [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA16_2]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA140]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA41]s. All of those creatures can be found around the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09].</p>

          <p>I'm not surprised. Your mentality only mirrors that of those around you, and yet I was foolish enough to allow myself to feel the smallest spark of hope....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My knowledge is priceless, [%username]. All I ask in return for sharing it is the respect and gratitude that other masters in this hall receive on a daily basis. Is that really so much to ask, in exchange for such power?</p>

          <p>Perhaps I was over-generous in expecting you to take longer: Elemental Water is not difficult to obtain. It is the basest substance we alchemists deal with, the first rung on a mighty ladder that stretches as far as your imagination allows.</p>

          <p>Gather the Lesser Elemental Stones, then refine them using the implements in this room! The creatures from which you get the stones are even around the Verteron Citadel. It couldn't be simpler!</p>
