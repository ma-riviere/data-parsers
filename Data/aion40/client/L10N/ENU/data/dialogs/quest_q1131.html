          <p>Welcome to Verteron, [%username]. I see you've brought your own armor. That's a relief.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our local Guardians whine about theirs all the time. Too old, too ragged, doesn't fit properly... I know, I know--soldiers complaining about their kit, what else is new?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the fact is, they're right. By now, most of them are wearing pieces someone else died in. That's bad for morale. I ordered more, but it hasn't arrived yet.</p>

          <p>We're not sure. All our orders go through Sagirunerk.</p>

          <p>I've just started doing business with him, and so far his goods have always been acceptable.</p>

          <p>My thanks. We're planning a raid on the Tursin Outpost soon, and if we had new armor before then, it would boost morale. And save lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LF1a_01] doesn't know what you're talking about, show him this receipt. All the details are there in writing, signed and sealed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that doesn't work, you can always mention his chances of doing business with us again.</p>

          <p>Anyway, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA73] was supposed to make armor--we supply materials, wait, and nothing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kind Daeva, will you go to Nadaelo and find out what happened? I have asked again and again...always nothing. Take this. This was agreement Nadaelo made with Sagirunerk. See? You take this, shove in his face, be big scary Daeva!</p>

          <p>See this, [%userclass]? This is armor made in the traditional Verteron style--Starturtle Shell and Starcrab Carapace on the outside, dense padding on the inside. You won't get through that with an ordinary blade.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This set's not for sale, I'm afraid. I would make more, but I've got no decent materials. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos keep pushing cracked shells and shoddy carapaces on me, pressuring me to work with them. There's nothing to be made from that junk, though.</p>

          <p>Hyacinte was worried that his soldiers were using old, worn-out armor, so he placed an order with Sagirunerk for new armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The delivery date has passed, and Hyacinte hasn't received a shipment. He asked you to see Sagirunerk and find out the reason for the delay.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Sagirunerk passed the blame to Nadaelo, who was contracted to make the armor. So you visited Nadaelo.</p>
