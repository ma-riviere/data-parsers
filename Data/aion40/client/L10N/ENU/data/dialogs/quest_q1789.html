          <p>Filthy Asmodian vultures! The fortress was full of their muck and garbage when we captured it.</p>

          <p>I almost had to scrub the walls to get out the stench!</p>

          <p>I wish I could repay them for making me break my back clearing out all that refuse, but the Generals won't let us off the leash.</p>

          <p>Let's be honest. How will we take Primum Landing and blast the Asmodians off Atreia if we keep losing and retaking fortresses like this?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think becoming immortal smothered their sense of urgency. Aion can't wait on us forever!</p>

          <p>The Aether's running out, and to save Elysea we have to eliminate both the Asmodians and the Balaur, and soon.</p>

          <p>We have a chance to teach the Asmodians a good lesson by crippling their bind point, [%username], so they won't even think of approaching here again.</p>

          <p>Yeah, and we could plunder their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1789a]es as well. However much they want this fortress, they can't take it without weapons and provisions!</p>

          <p>I can't disobey orders, but...you want glory? Attack [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Menglad], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Modsognir], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Reginlief], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Moinn], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Geri] at the Asmodians' bind point and steal their supplies.</p>
