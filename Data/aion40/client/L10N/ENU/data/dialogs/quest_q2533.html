          <p>I'm so glad you went to the trouble of bringing me this bottle. Now I can finally get a sample of the poison to analyze, which will almost certainly lead me to a preventative vaccine.</p>

          <p>Oh, but [%username]--you've been with me from the start and you know exactly what I'm trying to accomplish here! You're the perfect candidate to carry this task through to its end.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The poison is easy to spot. It's the green puddle around [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_MS_Britra]. You just have to scoop it up. Quickly, of course.</p>

          <p>Here's the potion bottle. Now, the most important part of this mission is that you must return no later than five minutes after scooping up the poison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that, it will be useless--not worth analyzing.</p>
