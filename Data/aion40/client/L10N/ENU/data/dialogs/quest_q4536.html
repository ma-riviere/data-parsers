          <p>Yeah, the Spriggle Gatherers are back and chewing anything that's not dirt. They're ruining all the resources we normally gather, but it turns out that they're being driven here by something bigger.</p>

          <p>Excellent! We didn't have those things up in the Abyss, so I have no idea how to deal with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg4_34_An]s are the ones driving the Gatherers here. We figured if we were to kill the Bundlers, the others would flee back to wherever they came from. It's the only plan we have at the moment, so it better work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill enough of them to make an impact, then come back for your fee.</p>
