          <p>This is unfair. How can dead Elyos make so much more trouble than live ones?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're establishing our presence on the Twilight Battlefield. When my scouts found a lightly defended Guard Tower there, I seized the opportunity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Only two Elyos scholars and a Shugo merchant there, my scouts said. A squad of Asmodae's finest should sledgehammer it.</p>

        <p>No! It turns out the place is crawling with Elyos ghosts, and our squad took a shameful beating. The Twilight Battlefield saw some grisly fighting in the early years of the war, and the ghosts of Daevas who were Vanished then still wander it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A lot of Daevas--some ours, some theirs--died on that field. But the Elyos ghosts have gathered near that tower. Teach them a good lesson, [%username]. I want you to drive them out completely from the Twilight Battlefield.</p>

          <p>You get the idea. And if you venture out there again, don't be shy about reducing the ghost population. Every little bit helps the war effort, eh?</p>
