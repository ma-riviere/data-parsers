          <p>This would be a bit more dangerous than the Scolopens. Basilisks have been coming up to our tent lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They move slowly, but can charge at incredible speed and crush you with their full strength.</p>

          <p>They are. And they only act that way around Humans, although I don't know why. </p>

          <p>The guardians could handle the Basilisks, but if they did, they wouldn't get anything else done that day.</p>

          <p>No matter how many we catch, there are just too many of them. Pleased defeat some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Basilisk_28_An]s, won't you? </p>

          <p>Thank you so much. I was afraid that you might be too busy to take the mission.</p>

          <p>Seven [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Basilisk_28_An]s should be enough to get us back on track.</p>
