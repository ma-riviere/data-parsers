       <p>A new face! It's been some time since anyone came from Teminon Landing.</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>And the fortress. Is everyone there okay? Centurion Erienne? Centurion Nereus?</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>I wonder if they are doing all right. And Lucius? He was such a young novice when I came here. Ah, I miss them.</p>

          <p>Oh, right. I'm Kenia, um, I do many things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, two things. One is to watch the movement of the Sulfur Archipelago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmodians, mainly. But also, Balaur often show up here, especially the Dredgion.</p>

          <p>Balaur from the Dredgion are extremely dangerous. In fact this holds true not only for us, but also for Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>This post is close to the Teminon Landing. We block the Balaur from infiltrating into the bind point, attacking each one as they come.</p>  
          <p> </p> 
          <p>But we're short of hands around here. And they keep coming. By the look of your [%mainslotitem], you're a [%userclass], right? Could you help us?</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you so much. I'm relieved that you will help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Patrol the Sulfur Archipelago and get rid of every [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_LizardmanFi_29_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_LizardmanRa_28_An] that you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should slow their assault some. There might be Asmodians as well, so please be careful.</p>

          <p>It's just that we're so short-handed... </p>
