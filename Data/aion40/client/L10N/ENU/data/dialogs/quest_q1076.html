          <p>This is all that I know. You'll need to get the Hidden Proof Orb in order to see the rest of what happened between those two. For that, though, you'll need the components.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1076a] through hunting, and a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_jewelry_n_c_30b] is found commonly in Atreia. Getting a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1076c] will be a bit more difficult. You can only find it at the Grave of Claws in the upper layer of the Abyss, and you must defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_ElementalFire2_40_An] that guards it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you've collected all the materials, take them to Alchemy Master [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Diana]. I'll contact her in advance--when she has the materials, she'll make the Hidden Proof Orb for you.</p>
