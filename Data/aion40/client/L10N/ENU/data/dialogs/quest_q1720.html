          <p>Sometimes I think my job is nothing more than shoring up morale. At least I can do that much...perhaps more....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are only about thirty Asmodian generals of any reputation in Reshanta, you know. Their defeat would mean a lot strategically, and would improve our morale as well.</p>

          <p>It may not seem like warfare to you to eliminate [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Dgrade01]s and leave the armies in place, but there are many kinds of warfare, and many kinds of soldiers.</p>

          <p>Take the best and bravest of your comrades-in-arms, and kill only the enemies worth killing. This won't be easy, but it's not meant to be a suicide mission.</p>
