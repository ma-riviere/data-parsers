          <p>I just...I just don't understand this manastone stuff! Now that the Manastone Removers Association lost its Sanctum funding, we just don't have the resources to learn how to dismantle these things properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I end up breaking more than I salvage! The union is losing money because of me! They'll send me to Revenge Valley if they ever get word of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you do me a big favor, Daeva? Find me 10 each of these old HP +60, Accuracy +20, and Block +20 manastones? I'll give you some brand new manastones if you do....</p>

          <p>Perfect, Daeva. These are perfect. They say that Nezekan is the patron lord of the union workers, and I'm starting to believe it now! You saved my hide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, as promised, here is your reward. These are very old, very rare manastones that were refurbished by some Shugos we do business with. Their powers are quite unique.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until next time, Daeva. Walk in the light.</p>
