          <p>Well, that's embarassing. But it's true. I'm weak. I took some men just a few hours ago to go capture the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We thought it was going to be simple. Crush the enemy, spill their blood, and all that good stuff.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Turns out they weren't normal garrison troops over at the fortress. They were elites. And they wiped the floor with us.</p>
