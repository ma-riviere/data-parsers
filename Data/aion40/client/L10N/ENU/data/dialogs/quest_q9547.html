          <p>You look as if you're dying for the Fortress Battle experience in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I understand. The proudest moment for every Daeva is the Fortress Battle in Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But look at your level. You'll be finished by the Elyos Guard and wake up beside Obelisk even before you reach the fortress, to say nothing of the Fortress Battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, calm down. I will help you. </p>

          <p>But you have to promise one thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Fortress Battle is a very fierce combat. So you should prove your determination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that would be... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to be determined to go to flat rate pricing plan as soon as Aion launches its charge scheme. At least for three months.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you sure you're going to do that?</p>

          <p>The determination he said was nothing but your intention to move to flat rate charging as soon as Aion launches its charge scheme. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when you considered the flat rate charging for a while and then talked to him, he upgraded your XP high enough to go for the Fortress Battle. </p>
