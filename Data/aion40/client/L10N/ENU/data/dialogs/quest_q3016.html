          <p>Daeva, do you wish to hold one of our stakes? Is great honor.</p>

          <p>Unless you believe crazy story about Asmodian Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yadamonerk thinks such things are nonsense, but Shugo law is clear--all negotiations must be thoroughly investigated.</p>

          <p>Is perfectly logical! She says Asmodian is Hamerun the Leech, yes? Must investigate every angle--sharpening additional stakes wastes time and Kinah, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva laws just as clear, nyerk. Contact Sanctum, wait for Shadow judges, yes? Oil won't boil for long in this weather, and Shugo vengeance does not taste good cold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva can find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DarkDevaKnNamedQ_25_Ae], is good for everyone, yes? No need for messy investigations, expensive Shugo Express messages, name calling....</p>

          <p>Either Hecuba or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DarkDevaKnNamedQ_25_Ae] is criminal who cheated and killed a Shugo. One is in our paws, the other--if even real--waits for Daeva, possibly surrounded by angry Kerubar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is not only for the Meniherk Excavation Union, but also for Theobomos and Sanctum! Daeva does not want a world full of angry Shugos, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if Daeva does not find, Yadamonerk will make sure an extra sharp stake is saved, akakakak!.</p>

          <p>Meniherk Excavation Union now can concentrate on  relic excavation and advancement of Elyos research. Stakes and oil will wait for another time.</p>

          <p>Not only Shugos, but high ranking officials in Sanctum should be thanking Daeva. And probably Hecuba as well, yes?</p>
