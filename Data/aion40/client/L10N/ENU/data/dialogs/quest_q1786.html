          <p>It's the simple rules that must be remembered, Daeva. Without them our processes will fail, and our opponents will be able to flush us away in no time at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, with that rule in mind, look at the Fortress. Do you believe it is ripe for the taking?</p>

          <p>How can we attack when our defenses are so weak? We can just about defend ourselves here, but were we to expand further, our forces would be spread too thin to fight or even communicate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, we must fortify ourselves here, strengthen our defenses, and only then look to expand. It's a simple process, but one we mustn't overlook.</p>

          <p>Well, the most immediate threat is the Balaur. A Dredgion recently appeared, you see, and now there are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_LizardmanFi_39_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_LizardmanRa_39_An]s roaming throughout the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They must be removed before we can even think of expanding, and for them to be removed we must look outside of our own ranks for help. To others like you, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what do you say? Will you help us?</p>

          <p>Now we know the Balaur are experts at scavenging from their own dead, so we must make sure their weapons won't be used again. Take them, and bring them back to us.</p>

          <p>Look at them...even the weapons look bestial. The designs are so impractical but they're used with such deadly force.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't help but wonder how many of our kin have been slaughtered by this one weapon. Still, better to have them out of their hands and into ours.</p>
