          <p>Look at those Maekis. Look at them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ugly things, aren't they? I've heard they were once calm and kind herbivores, and changed into the creatures you see now as they adapted to Eltnen's desertification.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now they roam around and attack without reason. They have been transformed to vicious beasts.</p>

          <p>Yes. The Asmodians share many traits with the Maekis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both attack our kind, both are forceful and vicious, and both need to be shown their place. However, the Asmodians only have themselves to blame for their fall from grace; the Maekis simply suffered at the hands of Asmodian obstinacy.</p>

          <p>Of course. The Five have no sympathy for fate.</p>

          <p>The Maekis have become violent to us, and now we must fight back. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Displacerbeast_26_An]s have overrun the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G1], and now we must push back, and reclaim the site.</p>

          <p>Now, a quick word of advice for you. Maekis are ferocious and attack with tooth, claw, and those tentacles on their backs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be wary of their attacks, wait until they tire, then attack with precision and speed.</p>
