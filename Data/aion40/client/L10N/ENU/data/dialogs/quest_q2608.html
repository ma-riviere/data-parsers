          <p>A detachment of Archons from Beluslan Fortress went to Besfer recently. Their report...frankly, it wasn't good. Not at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All our efforts to save the village may be in vain, not to mention the rest of this region. Aion help us all if the report is true.</p>

          <p>One of them saw a herd of Odd Granker drinking contaminated water flowing in Besfer Village. The same water that will turn a weakling into a powerful undead with a single drop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ran to Besfer as soon as I heard, but the Granker had scattered by then. Worse yet, they're highly migratory. They could spread the contamination across the region within weeks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're working on a better solution, but for now, all we can do is kill Odd Granker before the worst happens. Can you do this for us?</p>

          <p>So far, none of the contaminated Granker have become undead, but that could change any day now.</p>

          <p>It was [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerMinerD_35_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerD_35_An]s that were seen drinking the water.</p>

          <p>Grankers are mobile creatures. We plan to watch their movements carefully, not to mention set up guards to keep any more from drinking the Besfer water.</p>
