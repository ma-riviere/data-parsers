          <p>I was assigned here to reconstruct Impetusium. This is a posting I sought, but nothing prepared me for what lies below.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lack of materials, vengeful ghosts and spirits. The situation is less than ideal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've requested additional support from Pandaemonium. They sent Grak, but there's only so much he can do. If there is no relief soon, we must withdraw.</p>

          <p>Do you see that pillar? Once its diameter was more than two arm-lengths around. Rebuilding it requires a large quantity of reinforcing rods. Expensive ones...that are not coming. We're adapting the iron fragments found below into a fair substitute, but the work is hard and the laborers are harried by revenants.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These are difficult for Humans, but they would not frighten a Daeva. If you gather [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2257a]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_24], you'll inspire the laborers to do the same.</p>
