          <p>A few of the Elders in the village don't like the fact that a woman runs the local watch. It seems they'd get over that kind of thing when female Daevas can turn whole towns into molten wreckage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They say "Fighting is for men," and "You're too pretty to be swinging a sword." Bah! I can take any five of them in a fight and they know it. That's why I'm in charge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it really shards me off!</p>
