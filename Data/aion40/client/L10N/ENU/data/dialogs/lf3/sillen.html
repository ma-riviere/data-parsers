          <p>Some people call me "The Luckiest Woman".</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not really my fault. Once I was captured by Kerubs and a wandering Daeva saved me. Then I fell from a cliff and survived because my clothes got caught in the branch of a tree.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when people ask me how I got stuck in such an awful place, I say "Just lucky I guess!"</p>

          <p>The secret is...well, I don't know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe it's because I don't have a fear of death? I know it's strange for a Human, but the thought of dying doesn't bother me. If I go to join the flow of Aether, it's Aion's will, and not something to be feared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or maybe...I'm just really, really lucky.</p>
