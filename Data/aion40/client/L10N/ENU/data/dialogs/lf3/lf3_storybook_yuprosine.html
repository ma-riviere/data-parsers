          <p>No one knows for certain what triggers ascension. But in my case, pain was the impetus that drove my transformation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guilt. Pain. Remorse. I couldn't forget. Sleep only brought nightmares. I couldn't eat. There was no rest from the vivid memories and endless pain and guilt and sorrow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I decided to end my suffering with death. I wanted to rest. When I picked up the blade to take my life...I ascended. It was like I was cursed. At that moment I realized I COULD NOT die, and I finally realized what I had to do. It is my duty to send the suffering Undead back to the flow of Aether. I must set things right. </p>

          <p>The signs of danger in Heiron relieved themselves slowly. Rumors spread that something suspicious was happening in Kishar Village--but no one was really worried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The people of Medeus Manor and Orton Farm were always nervous because Krall would attack them without warning. The manor owner, Medeus, and his steward Kacias sent many letters to the fortress asking for help. But the fortress had no bodies to spare...all forces were engaged fighting fiercely against the Asmodians in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jeiaparan Village, where I lived, was relatively quiet and safe behind its moat of water. We were well aware that Kishar Krall do not like water.</p>

          <p>Although afraid of possible attacks, people believed they were safe. They thought Krall would never attack Human villages. And that even if they did, the fortress would not abandon farms and manor. They believed that if something horrible happened, their neighbors in Jeiaparan Village would come to help their aid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day at dawn, Kishar Krall invaded Orton Farm, but no one came to rescue the people.</p>

          <p>The fight between Krall and Humans was one-sided. How could Humans who only knew farming withstand the superior physical power of the Krall?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After destroying Orton Farm, the Krall advanced on Medeus Manor. The people of Medeus Manor were no match for the Krall either. Weilding farming tools, they desperately fought against the invading Krall but all were slaughtered in less than an hour.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The villagers of Jeiaparan heard the news the next day. A woman who managed to escape with her child told the tragic story.</p>

          <p>After hearing the news of Orton Farm and Medeus Manor, the villagers ran to their aid. But none could approach the farm. They smelled blood and saw Krall everywhere. The people were so afraid that they turned and ran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back at the village, they started to erect barracades and sent a letter to the fortress begging for help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I did not do anything. I prayed again and again to the Five Empyrean Lords to prevent the Krall from attacking my village. Then I discovered for the first time how the people of Orton Farm and Medeus Manor had felt. </p>

          <p>The fortress sent Guardians, yet it was not easy to drive out the Krall. The prolonged battle impacted my village disastrously. Orton Farm and Medeus Manor no longer provided crops, the only source of income for Jeiaparan Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugos left the village first. The Changarnerk Traders, the Wind Breeze Traders, and the Black Cloud Traders closed their shops in the village. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Merchants who traded agricultural products were also hit hard. As there were no workers who could carry cargo and even fewer customer to buy goods, the merchants left the village. Sailors and shipyard workers had to leave for other ports. Our once thriving village became a desolate place.</p>

          <p>However, it was not the end of the tragedy, but the beginning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just as people began to forget the tragedy of Orton Farm and Medeus Manor, one of the villagers disappeared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A young woman who had gone to draw water from the Genesis Spring, never came back. She was my love, Ilbrein. I lost my mind when Ilbrein didn't return. I ran out of the village like a mad man. I found her shoes on the road between the Orton Farm and the Medeus Manor. But no other signs of her...only her little shoes!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Desperately looking, with her shoes clutched in my hands, I came across an Anubite holding a torn piece of Ilbrein's clothing.</p>

          <p>I picked up a club and sprang at the Anubite. Uncontrollable anger gave me great power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shouting like a crazy man, I pounded the Anubite into pieces. Then I beat all the other Anubites around me to pulp. I fell exhausted to my knees. Half-conscious, I lay on the ground and stared. I could not believe my eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the Anubite's belongings scattered before me was familiar. It was a buckle that Ganges, my friend from childhood, used to wear. I had given him the buckle as a gift.</p>

          <p>The Anubite, the monster I bashed into bits, turned out to be my friend who had been killed by Krall. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that day, Undead appeared one after another at Orton Farm and Medeus Manor. The residents of Jeiaparan Village, who now knew that the Undead were once their neighbors, friends, and lovers, could not kill them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People did not talk about the Undead, but avoided Orton Farm and Medeus Manor. Even those who had lived in the village for generations began to leave.</p>

          <p>I allowed agony, guilt, and loss to destroy both my body and soul. I should have protected my lovely Ilbrein.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could not help but think that Ilbrein would not have died if I had helped Orton Farm and Medeus Manor when the Krall invaded. The encounter with Ganges placed more guilt upon my shoulders. I didn't help him when he needed me, and I killed him again...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually I left the village and Heiron. In agony, I ascended.</p>

          <p>I realized then what I am destined to do. It is my duty to return the Undead of Orton Farm and Medeus Manor, once my neighbors and friends, to the flow of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I kill them, that is true, but it is the only way to give peace to their souls. I will not give up even if it takes decades, centuries, or even lifetimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a long life to live. Perhaps I can finish this job one day. The moment I send back the last Undead to the flow of Aether is the moment when I am free at last.</p>
