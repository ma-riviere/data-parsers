          <p>Sometimes I don't like it here very much and people wonder why I came here at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, it's because I used to read books about Superus. Even before the Empyrean Lords ascended, the Superans fought the Balaur! They were the first to recognize the divinity of the Empyrean Lords, even when the other Sapien races had doubts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My favorite book was "Rediscovery of the Superus Civilization," but out here I can see new discoveries with my own eyes! You just have to know where to look.</p>
