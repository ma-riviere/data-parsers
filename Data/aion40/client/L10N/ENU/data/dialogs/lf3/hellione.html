          <p>I have been living in Jeiaparan Village for more than 50 years, ever since I married Zetus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The village was idyllic then. I mended nets and my husband fished. We lived in peace and worked diligently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the entirety of Heiron is devastated. Undead, Balaur....</p>

          <p>Oh, no. I won't leave. I would rather die where my memories lie, rather than live in a strange place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, I am waiting for my son. He's off fighting in a remote place called Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often see him in my dreams. A sign that he will come back soon, don't you think?</p>
