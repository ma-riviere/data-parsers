          <p>I'm so frustrated! Here we are, guarding the Observatory, while the Balaur are rampaging not far from here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Protecting the Observatory is not the same as protecting the Aetheric Field--there's no proof one relates to the other.</p>

          <p>If it were up to me, I wouldn't be standing here, idle. I would go crush those Balaur!</p>
