          <p>We had plenty of supplies when we came to Heiron, but now I'm running short of everything. Since we couldn't moor directly at the shore, we tried carrying goods in a ferryboat. The boat sank, and we lost everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since then we've been trying to make due with what we've got left but it's not easy. Some of the things we lost are very difficult to replace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until we have more supplies, I just have to do my best to stretch the inventory I've got.</p>
