          <p>For generations I have lived among the noble Elim, in harmony with their ways. I know more about them than any Daeva living.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All faithful Humans praise and respect the Elim and heed their wishes. Few truly understand them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have compiled all that I have learned about these proud trees. May Lady Yustiel guide my pen.</p>

          <p>No Human knows the origins of the Elim. The Elim themselves hold that they were ascended from trees in the same way that Daevas were ascended from Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Daevas protect Humanity, so do Elim protect the forest. They tell legends of heroes like Miranu the Unburning who fought the Balaur in the Millennium War.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Human history, typically for our self-centered species, is silent on the subject.</p>

          <p>Other legends hold that the great tree Arbolu is the progenitor of the Elim, and perhaps of all other trees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These stories tell of how Arbolu was created by Aion at the dawn of Atreia and tasked with creating all the trees and flowers in the world. While this may not be true, he is certainly the oldest living Elim by far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Arbolu himself rarely speaks, preferring to use a Gnarl as his mouth and ears. A small camp of Human worshippers has sprung up around him and he shelters them with his embrace.</p>

          <p>Like Daevas, Elim are suffused with Aether. As they age and grow, the Aether flowing through their veins builds up to such levels as to give them magical abilities to equal any Human mage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The magics of which the eldest Elim are capable far surpass Human abilies. These Elim have grown to such great size that they can no longer walk around, but must remain rooted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These Elim no doubt rival the Empyrean Lords for power, though, unlike Humans, they would never stoop to making showy, conspicuous displays of magic.</p>

          <p>Lord Daminu of Poeta is one such ancient Elim. He has become the guardian of all the forests around him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Merely by willing it, he can sprout trees into being and make them grow into towering behemoths overnight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is said his powers are so great, he can even scry into the past and the future--but he refuses to share this knowledge with any but the most holy of Daevas.</p>

          <p>Rarely, Elim produce fruit. These fruits have strange powers indeed, dripping with Aether and the blessings and love of the Elim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some let the taster relive her cherished memories. Others cure deadly poisons, cure incurable diseases, or even heal wounds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One strange fruit that I sampled brought a feeling of intense euphoria and oneness with all of nature. I felt as though my consciousness had entwined with that of the Elim whose fruit I swallowed, and I realized that we were all part of the same being, all part of Aion.</p>

          <p>If only I could feed that fruit to all Atreia and make them realize the importance of living in harmony with nature. We should not cut ourselves off from nature by living in ivory towers in the sky, nor should we seek the unnatural energies of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We should nurture the once-fertile lands of Elysea back to the way they were before the scars of the Cataclysm! We should embrace the dirt and sweat of a farmer's honest toil!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Elyos and Asmodians could unite once more under the sheltering branches of the Elim.</p>

          <p>After all, the Elim want only peace, and all devout believers in Aion respect the wishes of his noble servants, the Elim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva who does not do whatever the Elim would ask of him is a Daeva who turns his back on Aion's other servants.</p>

          <p>This is why I distrust the Lepharists. The Elim whisper to me of strange things being done to the Elim by these blasphemers, strange corruptions spreading in the forests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They tell of monsters, too, of Elim twisted into gnarled, pained, unnatural forms, angry beasts that stalk the shadows of the forest bringing pain to the creatures they once protected.</p>

          <p>If we fail to respect the Elim, we risk invoking the anger of nature. Imagine if they were to turn the trees themselves against us, roots and branches strangling our cities, vines encircling our throats.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet if we pay them heed and cultivate our friendship, the Elim are potent allies. If they did not have to turn their attentions to the rot and desertification throughout Elysea, they could use their powers to drive the Balaur from Atreia forever.</p>
