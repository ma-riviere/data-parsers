          <p>Do you think the future can be foretold?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few years ago, I never imagined I would come to a place like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to be a Reference Librarian in the Library of the Sages. My job was to help you find whatever book you might need.</p>

          <p>It's because of Senea. Se used to come ot the library and I helped her find material for her research.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>The one day she asked me if I wanted to join her expedition to Heiron to study Klaws. It seemed crazy, but I accepted because it was a once in a lifetime chance.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>At the beginning I wanted to go back, but as the research went on I started to enjoy it. It's quite rewarding to discover new things.</P>
