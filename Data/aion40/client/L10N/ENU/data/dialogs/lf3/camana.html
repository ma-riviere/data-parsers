          <p>To be frank, I think the Watch is far from ready. Most members don't know how to use weapons, let alone strategy or tactics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They couldn't defeat a single Crasaur if they all attacked it at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I feel anxious whenever I look at them.</p>

          <p>As a young girl, I learned swordsmanship and martial arts from a Guardian who worked in my village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if I joined the Watch, that undisciplined mob couldn't learn to fight in a single night. I'd rather just keep an eye on the situation for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I will step forward if the village is in danger.</p>
