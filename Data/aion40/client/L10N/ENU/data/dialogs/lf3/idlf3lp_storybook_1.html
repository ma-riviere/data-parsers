          <p>I. Introduction</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Twenty years have passed since the Secret Laboratory was established by Lepharist Revolutionaries to research biological mutation of the creatures of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is my duty as a researcher of Lepharist Revolutionaries to document all research data so our future generations will continue this important research after we have returned to the flow of Aether. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had only one thing in mind while compiling the research results from the last two decades into a book. This is for posterity. It is important for our people to understand what we did and why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the fruits of our labors be a boon to our cause. This book and all our scientific achievements are dedicated to Lord Lephar.</p>

          <p>II. Mechanism of Mutation</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All biological mutation studies are based on one assumption: All living organisms in Atreia consume Aether and each of them has a unique way of expelling the unused Aether. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This assumption is based on observation and theory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most perplexing challenge is discovering and proving how each creature consumes and expels Aether. The reserach is not valid until it is proven.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This challenge is the starting point of the Lepharist Revolutionaries mutation research.</p>

          <p>III. The Purpose of Mutation</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All living creatures absorb Aether. Each creature circulates the absorbed Aether within its body, following its own process, then expels the excess Aether in a variety of ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you stop the creature from expelling excess Aether, the creature may die or become more powerful. This differentiation is based on how the excess Aether is forcibly contained within the creature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you interfere with a creature's biological mechanism of circulating and expelling absorbed Aether, you may be able to strengthen its unique innate power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The research center calls a living organism mutated to maximize its capability a "Complete" or "Completed" Subject. A Complete Subject has reached the pinnacle of its desired transformation and does not expel excess Aether.</p>

          <p>IV. Case Studies</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although we have conducted numerous experiments with a variety of creatures in order to create a Complete Subject, only a few have been successful. This does not deter us from our goal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Despite the current failures to create a Complete Subject, the mutation research itself has produced many useful results. We have used the findings of each test in other tests or for other purposes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please note that all experiments mentioned here were performed within the Lepharist Research Center and their results might be affected by natural features of the surrounding area including climate and Aether distribution.</p>

          <p>1. Slime</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first creature chosen as a test subject for mutation was the Slime. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since Slimes respond very quickly to outside stimuli, they were the most useful subjects for the beginning of the mutation research. Slimes recover at a rapid rate, thus, mutations occur within days rather than a much longer period of time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most successful test result from the Slime series was the Slime mutated as a medium to spread poison. This poisonous Slime was a potential but imperfect weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mutated Slime was so sensitive to outside stimuli that it mutated again as time went by despite our attempts to freeze the mutation chain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because of this flaw in the Slime's Aethergenetic makeup, we have not succeeded in creating a Complete Slime--yet.</p>

          <p>2. Moonflower</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because of its strong poison and ability to attack enemies from a distance, the Moonflower seemed ideal as a biological weapon. However, it is difficult to change the properties of the Moonflower's poisonous stings and mutate it to shoot the stings as directed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this time, we have not found a chemical process to halt the expelling of Aether from the Moonflower's body. This may be due to the fact that the Moonflower's poison and stings actually contain the creature's excess Aether and this allows it to expel what its body does not need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some researchers see the potential of the Moonflower as a biological weapon and refused to give up. They continue their research, trying other methods. They are not likely to produce significant results, but scientists must follow their passion.</p>

          <p>3. Mudthorn </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mudthorn is a popular test subject among researchers due to the ease with which its Aethergenetics may be modified. The resulting mutations have been thoroughly studied.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of the resulting mutation Mudthorns, only three of the mutated test subject are considered to be a success. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first was designed to maximize poison strength. The second was designed to maximize the attack power of its thorns. The third was designed to change sap in various forms. Each one of these mutations followed a different Aethergenetic thread.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We may be able to create a Perfected Mudthorn if we are able to find the proper Aethergenetic mutation threads to combine the three mutations into one Mudthorn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We applied tainted Aether to produce the mutated Mudthorn. It is important to note the results vary based on the concentration of the tainted Aether used.</p>

          <p>4. Pretor</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have already succeeded in creating a Perfected Pretor. This shining achievement was made possible through several iterations of mutations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There were six Aethergenetic threads of mutation. Each was examined for their merits and flaws. After many days and nights of testing, we succeeded in creating a Perfected Pretor. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most successful material in mutating the Pretor into a Compete Pretor is the Aether-imbued pollutant extracted from the area near Beritra's Weapon buried in the Besfer Ghost Village of Beluslan, Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To create a Perfected Pretor, follow all the steps of making the six different types of Aethergenetic mutants in order (as found in Meader's scientific journal) and then inject the pollutant extracted from Beritra's Weapon into the Pretor.</p>

          <p>5. Cliona</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mutation of Cliona was a huge challenge because a Cliona is a creature more pure Aether than living organism. There is less biological material to work with for chemical alteration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This particular set of mutations was intended to turn the gentle airborne fish in to an agressive predator with no natural enemies. Not only would the Complete Cliona be an effective physical weapon, it would be an excellent psychological one as well. It would be a terrifying shock to our enemies if we mutated the fish into a monster that only top-class Daevas could catch and defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, we cannot catch enough Clionas for proper research or Aethergenetic manipulation. Without sufficient samples, this research has made little progress. A small quantity of test subjects has confirmed one thing: Clionas do not mutate easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are passing on this challenging task of collecting Clionas and studying their mutation to future scholars who should have better tool for capturing and studying these flying fish. </p>

          <p>6. Human</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ultimate goal of the Lepharist Research Center is to create a Complete Human. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is now conducting a variety of experiments on Humans to turn them into a Complete Subject. Of the most recent tests, the experiments of forcing Humans to ascend as Daevas and of extracting Stigma stones from Daevas have made a great progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans are not easily mutated due to the amount of biological material to work with. Feast or famine. In this case, feast. There are almost too many Aethergenetic threads to follow. We have narrowed it down to a few dozen of the most likely threads for success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After decades of research, we produced a Proto-Complete Subject called RM_78c. It is not perfect yet but it is very close to the original design. The center is now investing massive resources in developing an advanced model of RM_78c. We will be able to see a Complete Human stronger than a Daeva in a near future.</p>
