          <p>As workplaces go, this isn't exactly Sanctum, but I couldn't ask for a better spot to study the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm grateful the Changarnerk Traders let me work here--even if they ARE trying to soak me for every Kinah I've got.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes I feel guilty about not fighting the Balaur, but if my work helps get rid of the undead, it's worth it, right?</p>

          <p>Every now and then some Daeva comes through with a bone to pick--they say I'm not contributing to the war effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, a girl's got to make a living. And if I can do it helping to set this land right without getting killed, why not?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum's paying me to be here. And if I make a little on the side--an ancient pot here, an old manuscript there--well, I'm not hurting anyone.</p>
