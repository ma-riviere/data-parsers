          <p>Did Hideros send you to watch over me? Oh, that man! Why are men like that? Trying to keep women down and tell them what to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a good man--pleasant enough to talk with, and I enjoy having tea with him now and then. But he acts as if he were my boyfriend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He needs to understand that he's my friend--one of my best friends, in fact, like Tegis and Lantis!</p>

          <p>Oh. Sorry. I guess I'm used to him talking about me to strangers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't mistake me, he's sweet. But I can't tie myself down to just one person. Everyone, whether Human or Daeva, young or old, has their own charm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even men like Maximus who give me the cold shoulder. I don't mind at all--I just smile and live my life as I see fit.</p>
