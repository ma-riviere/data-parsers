          <p>Divine Power skills are special abilities that Aion has granted to Daevas like yourself. But there are some restraints on when you can use them. I think that's why even some veterans don't use the Divine Power at their disposal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Divine Power Test is an incentive proposed by the Governor to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call it a test, but it's really more of a training session. It ends when you use a chosen skill ten times. What do you think? Would you like to give it a go?</p>

          <p>Let me see...you're a Templar, which means you must have learned Hand of Healing recently. It restores you to perfect health, so use it well and it will help you greatly during times of crisis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The subject of your Divine Power Test will be that skill, so return to me once you've used [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DP_Kn] ten times. Like I said, we just want to get Daevas like yourself accustomed to using their Divine Power more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I will give you some armor useful to Templars as a reward.</p>

          <p>Hmmm...the flow of your Divine Power is smooth and uninterrupted. It seems you've practiced the Divine Power skill properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well done--you've passed the test. But keep improvement--Asmodae demands much of Daevas like you.</p>

          <p>Here's a reward we give to those who pass the test. This should be of use to you as a Templar.</p>
