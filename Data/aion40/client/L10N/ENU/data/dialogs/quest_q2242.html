          <p>Say, you know that [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA200], [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, people call it that because of all the Gergers around there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gergers look a lot like Spriggs, but they're definitely not Spriggs--they're a lot smarter.</p>

          <p>I wouldn't say this to just anybody, but I've heard some of them speaking our language.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the other day I was out collecting herbs, and I passed right by the Gerger Village. I've been kind of curious about them, actually.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw one, but he took one look at me and ran away. I didn't mean to scare him off.</p>

          <p>He dropped something--some kind of charm with writing on it. I really can't guess what an animal would need with something like that. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I want to give it back, but I'm afraid he'll run away again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have any plans to drop by the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA200], will you please return this to the Gerger?</p>
