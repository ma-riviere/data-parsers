          <p>You know what drives me crazy? Spriggs! The way they wander around in a stupor, it's hard for us to get any work done.</p>

          <p>Don't you worry about the Spriggs. A hungry Sprigg gathers food even faster. Call it "motivation," if you like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Spriggs are cowards, so they won't confront a [%userclass] like you. Feel free to use them for target practice.</p>

          <p>Don't get too bloodthirsty, though. Remember why you're there: sacks of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2001B]. Bring me three sacks.</p>

          <p>Well done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I watched you out there. You seem to be able to take a little punishment--always a good trait for a raider.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too many city recruits can dish it out, but they can't take it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even the Spriggs are starting to realize some of our guys aren't as tough as our veterans and Ulgorn himself. They're getting aggressive, and there are so many of them that we'll be in trouble if we don't do something soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need the Spriggs to fear us once more. Ready for more raiding?</p>

          <p>That's city talk. From a raider, I expect to hear "The task is mine!" or at least an "On my way!" followed by the sound of your footsteps.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me say it like Ulgorn would, and you can try again.</p>
