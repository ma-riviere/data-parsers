          <p>All right then. You've heard the latest, yes? The Daevas of Flame are melting the ice in Kurngalfberg with Magic Flame Wards as fast as they can, but they're running out of materials to create the flames.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've requested support from the Beluslan Fortress--Magic Wards material in exchange for armor found in Kurngalfberg. Since that means Balaur armor, it's worth a pretty penny, assuming you'll let someone pry it from your cold, cold hands.</p>

          <p>Let me check...they sent a list.... Blessed Small Magic Flame Ward Components are [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Blue Balaur Blood you can only get from special Balaur like Lazy Dragashum, Instructor Afrane, and Greatscholar Jaadis. I wouldn't go alone if I were you, but you'll know best, I'm sure. Blood for blood!</p>

          <p>Well, if those rewards don't appeal to you, you might consider getting materials for other wards. There are even better rewards for rarer materials.</p>

          <p>Hmm. This was good work, but it seems we've had a misunderstanding. I need two bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02] and 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s. That's not what you've got. Go get the right materials and I'll give you your reward. </p>
