          <p>Have you heard a the cry of a Specter?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an eerie sound unlike anything natural. It gives me goose bumps. But their cry has been known to attract some people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Often in the middle of the night people hear it, think a loved one is calling. They wander unaware to the Patema Ruins. We've are found and saved most villagers before...but some never make it back.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I went to the Blue Fleet, I hoped they'd take care of it, but they turned me down because of some hunt for Bollvig, or something. I was afraid that you might turn me down as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! I said too much....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never mind. Now, I don't know how many are out there, but eliminating nine or so [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spectre_41_An]s should reduce the nighttime hauntings.</p>
