          <p>Familiar face! Yes yes. Shugo always knows faces, and has seen this one before. But where? When? Hmm.</p>

          <p>Nyerk! No time for thinking! Maybe Daeva is interested in making Kinah?</p>

          <p>Akakak! Shugo always want to make Kinah, true, but Shugo never rip Daeva off! Look at me, so small and scrawny! Would make an excellent coat, if Daeva wanted it, yes? But Daeva doesn't want it. No no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva listen. I buy Transparent Wriggot powder from old man Vigbir, then sell it for profit in the city. Make good Kinah as middleshugo, but now supplies drying up because road...road is dangerous!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Need Daeva's help, see? Need big powerful [%userclass] to clear road and open up supply route again!</p>
