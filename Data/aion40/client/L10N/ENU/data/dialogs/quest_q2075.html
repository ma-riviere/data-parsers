          <p>It's hard to travel across Reshanta several times a day--and not just because it's a war zone. I know being a messenger is hazardous, yet I fear nothing. Exhaustion, however, is crippling me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the Shugos, Tierunerk, said I could test a secret project they're working on: Augmented wings that allow effortless flight at unheard-of speeds!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I gave him money to fund the prototype, but now Tierunerk says the delivery was delayed. I'm starting to get suspicious...would you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_D2] and find out what's really going on?</p>

          <p>Look, that's not my fault! I'm just the middle man! All I did was mention the special wings to Holm--I don't make them. I heard about the wings from Gaochinerk, one of the artisans at the Tigraki Workshop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think, why not put wing-makers and wing-wanters together--am I right? But then I lose touch with Gaochinerk, and Holm blames me! Nyerk, nyerk.</p>

          <p>The messenger Holm sought a faster, easier way to fly across Reshanta, so he paid Tierunerk for special Shugo-made wing augmentations. But Holm hadn't heard from Tierunerk, so he asked you for help.</p>

          <p>You found Tigraki Island, but Gaochinerk said the wings needed testing first. </p>

          <p>You tested the wings by flying to Black Cloud Island. Garkbinerk told you the wings were dangerous, so you returned to Gaochinerk and demanded an explanation. Gaochinerk said the wings were safe, but not quite fast enough yet.</p>

          <p>You told Holm, who was disappointed and said he'd seek a refund from Tierunerk.  </p>
