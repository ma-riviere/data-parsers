          <p>Trou's tasked us to clean up Medeus Manor. He wants us to be gentle and return the undead there to the flow of Aether with mercy.</p>

          <p>Worrying about the undead is a luxury. We have people--living, breathing souls--who need homes and good land to farm. The undead may suffer, but they're foul, vicious creatures.</p>

          <p>That's the size of it. If we want to resettle this land, we need to clear the way.</p>

          <p>The trouble is we don't have enough Guardians. The undead population is too large. And Heiron can't dispatch support troops--the Balaur keep him busy.</p>
