          <p>Ah, times are hard. Soul healing is something I love, but it doesn't pay as well as you might think. I need Kinah as much as anyone else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I make sure to keep an eye out for opportunities.</p>

          <p>Chagarinerk gave me a good lead a while ago. You know those feather accessories the Mau wear? Apparently they sell nicely!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos in the Traders' Berth buy them for a hefty price. I can't leave my post yet, but if you're interested, I can cut you into the profits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Black Claw Outpost--be sure to bring some friends--and get some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2277a]s.</p>

          <p>Great. If you go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_20] you will find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanHunterS_16_Ae]s. They carry the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2277a]s, so you'll need to take them down to get the prize.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please bring back 10. That should be enough to fetch a good price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will bargain with Chagarinerk in advance, so don't worry about that.</p>

          <p>These are the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2277a]s! They are beautiful. Now I see why they fetch such a high price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what you'd use such things for, but no matter.</p>
