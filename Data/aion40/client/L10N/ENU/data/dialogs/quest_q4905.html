          <p>But perhaps your arrival is more than just chance. Maybe the Shedim Lords wish to speed my research.</p>

          <p>I'm trying to uncover information about Brusthonin before the Cataclysm. Back in those days the area was defended by the legendary Red Sky Legion under General Virkel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They fought bravely against the Zunewgishe Legion under Dragon Lord Beritra. I'm planning to research how the battles went and how they defeated the Zunewgishe Legion. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the contamination in that area wiped out virtually all records of the war.</p>

          <p>Oh, it's important! I think we can learn things that will be of great use in our battles against the Balaur. I learned that some veterans of these ancient battles still live in Baltasar Hill Village!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to go interview them but my request was denied. They say I'd only interrupt reconstruction and "get in the way." Me, in the way? Can you imagine?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no one would stop you from going there! Could you go to the Baltasar Hill Village and speak to some of the veterans for me?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I was barely ascended at the time. The Balaur were determined to occupy Brusthonin and sent the Zunewgishe Legion against us. We'd all heard of them and most of us were scared, but we weren't going to run.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion inspired us to stand our ground. Without the excellent leadership of Brigade General Virkel, we would have lost all of Brusthonin to the Balaur.</p>

          <p>So, you'd like to know what I experienced on that terrible day so long ago?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My perspective may be different from others you'll speak to. You see, at that time I was still Human. We could tell that even the Daevas were afraid, and that terrified us. We couldn't escape though, so that left us no choice but to stand up to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine Humans standing up to Balaur? My father made arrows for the Daevas. My mother cooked food for the soldiers.</p>

          <p>I carried Odella powder from the village to the camp for the Daevas--to keep up their energy for fighting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day the whole world shook, and there was fire and then darkness. It was the Cataclysm, though I didn't know it at the time. I was scared, so I ran off to hide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must have been unconscious for some time, but when I woke up I knew I'd ascended. My parents died in the disaster. Considering what happened here later, I am glad they found peace.</p>

          <p>A scholarly work, eh? I have to say it's a good thing you came instead of Moreinen. Brusthonin is too dangerous for scholars.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be honest, I'm reluctant to recall those days. Not to belittle the accomplishments of more recent battles, but Beritra's Zunewgishe Legion was the most terrifying thing I ever faced.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was a raw recruit at the time. I shudder when I think of how incompetent I was. But if my story will help in fighting the Balaur, I'll do it.</p>

          <p>They were the best. We all respected them tremendously. Even when Dragon Lord Beritra entered the fray, they stood firm. Thanks to their Cleric, Angeiya, they resisted the fear Beritra projected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They held the Balaur back long enough for the field to regenerate, but they were overwhelmed and destroyed.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. I'll review this carefully. I'm eager to see what role the Red Sky Legion really played.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was a great victory based on the abilities of just a few remarkable Daevas? If so, should we create units composed only of elite Daevas?</p>

          <p>Some favor spreading our veterans around so they can serve as mentors to the young. Perhaps now I can determine which strategy is the best.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Being a scholar, she couldn't go to dangerous Brusthonin herself. So you took the Book of Record and gathered stories from several elder Daevas who served in Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned with the interviews, Moreinen was thrilled and got right to work on her strategic research on the Red Sky Legion.</p>
