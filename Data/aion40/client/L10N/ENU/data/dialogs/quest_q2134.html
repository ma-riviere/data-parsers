          <p>You been to Aldelle Village recently? I haven't been there in a long time, and you know why? It's that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tobu]; he hates my guts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you believe he sent me out here--the middle of nowhere--to dig up [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a2]?! Me, Alfrigh, former weapons trainer, now clawing his way through rocks lookin' for ore!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd laugh, except it really isn't all that funny.</p>

          <p>Well...there was that one time I hit him....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, one day Tobu was barking orders at me. I went to do what he asked, but then Ulgorn came by and asked me to do somethin' for him. 'Course, he's the boss--his order took precedence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm doing what Ulgorn asked when suddenly Tobu comes waddlin' over, spouting fire and brimstone 'cos I ain't done his job. Well...I'm not known for having the longest fuse, so I started shoutin' back...and then I hit him. He stormed off, I stormed off...and I thought that was the end of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The next day, I got word I'd been assigned a "special job"....</p>

          <p>Yep! I've been here for a couple of days now, and I still have no [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a2] to show for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard there's a bunch of it at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_8], but I can't just prance in there and ask the Mau for it! They'd shred me to pieces!</p>

          <p>You better get going, then. Tobu wants that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_n_c_10a2] right away. If I get the ore to him quickly enough, maybe it'll impress him and he'll assign me a better post!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, the ore can be found at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_8], though I've heard they have it at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_9] too, if you don't have much luck.</p>
