          <p>Don't let it swell your head, but you do bloody fine work these days, [%username]. I knew you had it in you, once you stopped piffling about and mucked in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's the secret ingredient to good Armorsmithing, you know. Elbow grease.</p>

          <p>You won't become a Master armorer polishing chairs with your backside, oh no! You keep at it. Job after job, day in, day out, until your bones ache and your vision goes wonky. No other way.</p>

          <p>Would you do me a favor, young [%username], if you so bloody value my esteem? Deliver these titanium chain gloves to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Baht] in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>Look, [%username]. Not everyone can get to the Abyss, and not all those keep their heads once they're there. I trust you.</p>
