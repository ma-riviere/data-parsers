          <p>He needs to either move on to someone else's district or...just stop talking about the thirteenth Empyrean Lord completely. Honestly, that'd be best for his health. Maybe you can let him know this?</p>

          <p>Thanks. If Vigbir is still up at the Lone Cottage, warn him never to mention the thirteenth Empyrean Lord again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That'll be good for him and us.</p>

          <p>She asked you to go to the Lone Cottage and persuade Vigbir not to mention the thirteenth Empyrean Lord anymore. You went to meet Vigbir, who said he'd bear the responsibility and not to worry.</p>
