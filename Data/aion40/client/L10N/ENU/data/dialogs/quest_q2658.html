          <p>I wasn't just sitting idle while you were in Elysea, [%username]. A girl's got to keep busy, even if she's a ghost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I knocked around the Bakarma Barracks and--get this--I eavesdropped on a conversation between a Draconute commander and a staff officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were speaking in Balaur so I may have missed something, but I think they were discussing getting reinforcements from the Indratu Legion to tighten their grip on Beluslan.</p>

          <p>That's an understatement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been thinking--if we can keep the Indratu Legion from responding when the Bakarma Legion makes their request for support, we may be able to at least maintain the status quo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need a diversion--and you're just the Daeva for the job, [%username]. Will you go to the Indratu Fortress and keep the legion busy?</p>

          <p>The Heiron Abyss Gate is inside the cave in Bakarma Barracks in the Nute Warren. That will lead you to the fortress.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should target the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_FeB_LizardFi_46_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_AeA_LizardAs_46_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_LizardBreeder_46_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_PeB_LizardPr_46_Ae]s. Just take them apart!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring back [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1510a]s, they'll not only serve as proof of your work, but they may be useful to us later.</p>

          <p>[%username], if I could take on this mission, believe me, I would. Unfortunately, I'm a little too insubstantial to make a difference.</p>

         <p>I hope [%username] survives. Maybe I shouldn't have asked for the Daeva's help...but I failed to protect the Aetheric Field Observatory in life--maybe I can make up for it in death.</p>

          <p>Once you're there, exterminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_FeB_LizardFi_46_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_AeA_LizardAs_46_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_LizardBreeder_46_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_PeB_LizardPr_46_Ae]s, and return with the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1510a]s.</p>

          <p>Gwendolin overheard the Balaur at the Bakarma Barracks discussing the request they sent to the Indratu Legion for reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She said the only way to stop the reinforcements was to create a diversion at the Indratu Fortress and exterminate the Balaur soldiers there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You annihilated the Balaur in the Indratu Fortress and returned with the Draconute's Helmets as proof. Gwendolyn thanked you.</p>
