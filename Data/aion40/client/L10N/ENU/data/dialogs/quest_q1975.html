          <p>That's just what a true Expert would say! I knew from the moment I met you that you had it in you.</p>

          <p>You can buy the Fasimedes' Noble Breastplates design and materials from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Menomes].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's similar to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1975]s, but requires more control and skill to make. This will be a shining example of your work.</p>

          <p>You can't make rare armor? Or perhaps you're not interested in receiving the title of Expert.</p>

          <p>Many people think that weapons are the most important element in combat, but I think the quality of the armor is more vital. How can you fight effectively if you're constantly worried about getting injured or killed?</p>

          <p>Good armor gives you the confidence to fight well. That's why I have a keen interest in nurturing talented Armorsmiths. I expect a lot from you, [%username].</p>
