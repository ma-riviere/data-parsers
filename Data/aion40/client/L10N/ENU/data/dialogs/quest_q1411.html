          <p>All right, listen to me carefully, as I detest repetition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The situation at the Kaidan Headquarters is getting more worrisome by the day. The Krall have always been aggressive, but they're getting more so--and they seem to be getting stronger as well. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My only theory is that the Krall are making something that's giving them enhanced strength and resilience. Probably an Odium derivative. It's the only explanation for the way they're behaving.</p>

          <p>It's only conjecture at this point, but Odium exposure tends to have those effects. It enhances strength and makes you almost impervious to pain. It'll also eventually kill you, but I don't think the Krall are especially concerned with the long-term health effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But someone needs to go into the Kaidan Headquarters and find out for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Telemachus seems to believe you are the ideal choice. I don't know why he would give this important mission to someone who's not a Guardian, but unlike some Daevas, I follow my Commander's orders.</p>

          <p>Well, at least his faith in you is justified that far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no time to waste. Go to the Kaidan Headquarters immediately and investigate the situation. My scouts reported suspicious boxes near their dugouts, but they couldn't get close enough to find out what they contain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should probably put together a posse. The Kaidan Headquarters is too dangerous for anyone to go there alone. Light show you the way.</p>

          <p>This is...a potion bottle? From the way it is shining, I think...I think Aether is blended in it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Krall are drinking potions like this, it would explain their sudden surge in strength. This must be reported at once.</p>

          <p>Tumblusen said that Kaidan Krall became stronger very suddenly, and that there must be a reason for it. On Commander Telemachus' recommendation, he asked you to go to the Kaidan Headquarters and bring back anything that might be a clue.</p>

          <p>When you presented the Suspicious Potion Bottle you found in the Headquarters, he said that the potion seemed to contain Aether.</p>
