          <p>Have you heard the tales flying about Reshanta?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rumor has it there's a gigantic Unfest on Shade Island! That's east of the Teminon Landing in Elyos-occupied territory. They say it is incredibly strong and attacks every Asmodian it encounters.</p>

          <p>Evidently, the Ellies call it Ladacus. Can you believe those sun-poxed Ellies are friendly with an Unfest? This Ladacus was once an Guardian but was turned into an Unfest as a punishment, so they say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard that it wears an Insignia of Elyos. Maybe if we defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Labdacus] or whatever it is, we will strike at the morale of the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think? Would you challenge it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>One more thing. After defeating the vile [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Labdacus], bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2728a] it wears as proof.</p>

          <p>Well, it is just a rumor. Perhaps the Unfest is not so real a threat as I fear...but if it joins forces with the Elyos and attacks us? Well, I thought, with your reputation, you'd want to prevent that. I shouldn't believe everything I hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe some brave Daeva will seek it out and destroy it.</p>

          <p>So, Ladacus really was bigger and stronger than normal Unfests. Yet, he was no match for a battle-hardened Daeva like yourself, [%username]!</p>
