          <p>Give me one second here...I've been looking for this passage in my research book all afternoon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just as I thought. Curse the light! I should have paid closer attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1646a]s you found for me some time ago? I just assumed they were as durable as other elemental flowers...and I accidentally destroyed the samples.</p>

          <p>Yes, I was wondering if you could get some more for me? I'd take passage to Stenon Bay myself to find them, but my research keeps me here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you mind, [%username]? I promise I'll take better care of the samples this time. I just had no idea that its posit mass was as brittle as a creek blossom.</p>

          <p>Blessed Ariel, that would be great! I have it all planned out for you. Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_F5], dispatch the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater4_44_An]s, and get some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1646a] for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Five flowers should be more than enough. And I promise I'll handle them more delicately this time.</p>

          <p>I should have known better than to trust a [%userclass] with my concerns. It's always blood and guts with you, isn't it?</p>

          <p>Sweet Lady of Light, they're wonderful! Their composition alters itself to match the shape of the flower perfectly. This could revolutionize science!</p>
