          <p>Ah [%username]! Asmodae is in your debt. I was able to conduct my research with those Lava Barghests out of the way, but the stubborn beasts are back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're on the verge of a breakthrough, and we just need to find one more important clue to solve this puzzle. If only I could discover the missing piece...it's driving me mad.</p>
