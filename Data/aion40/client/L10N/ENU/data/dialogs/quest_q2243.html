          <p>In a few days time, it will be my [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF1_5]'s birthday.</p>

          <p>I want to give her a gift that will really mean something to her. A [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2253a] is what I have in mind, but I've heard they're only sold in Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>No, I can't ask Kagorinerk--he's a blabbermouth! He'll gossip about it and it will get back to Mahirinerk and ruin the surprise!</p>
