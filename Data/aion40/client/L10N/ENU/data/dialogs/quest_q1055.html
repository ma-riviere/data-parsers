          <p>I heard a strange story about one of the undead at the ruins of Medeus Manor West recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Passersby claim an undead appears and tries to speak. Many have seen him, but no one's been brave enough to approach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He obviously wants to talk. [%username], will you find him and see what he wants?</p>

          <p>That may be true, but this one obviously has something to say. If we listen, maybe he'll reveal something about the undead that can help us put them to rest.</p>

          <p>We were at war against the Krall. The manor was beautiful then, gracious buildings amidst rolling hills and ancient trees. But the war changed everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the Krall approached, several times my lord asked the fortress to send Guardians to help us. But help never came.</p>
