        <p>Preface</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>At one time or other, all Daevas dream of becoming Miragent Holy Templars. Admit it. You've thought about it. Perhaps not while you were sober, but when the lights were dim and the cider was flowing, you've visualized yourself, a proud and fierce member of the mighty Miragents.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Your Miragent cloak flutters in the breeze. The hilt of your sword glints in the sunlight. Children follow you with awe.... Or perhaps these thoughts are mine alone, but I doubt it. I've seen that look in your eye. That look you deny, even to yourself.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>One fine day, while basking in a sunbeam at the Dionysia Tavern, it dawned on me. Perhaps you just need a little push. A tiny kick to get you moving in the direction of those dreams. Perhaps, it was just the unknown qualities of the Miragent Holy Templars path that stood in your way...or fear of the notoriously onerous qualification tests. If that was all...I could help! I could do this...I should do this...share my knowledge, help you on your way to fulfilling my...err...your dreams.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>So, I cleared a spot amongst the empty glasses, ordered another round of Sandblossom Wine, pulled out my quill, and set to.</p>

          <p align="center">After some thought, I've broken this topic down into the following bite sized bits. Just plug along through the list and before you know it you'll be wearing the badge of the Miragents.</p>

          <p>1. A Sage's Teachings</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To succeed as a Miragent, your body, mind and soul must work as one. Prepare yourself for the tasks ahead by visiting the Sages. Listen to their stories and think long and hard upon their words. Absorb their teachings. Understand and embrace the reason for the Daeva's existence.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Now if it were me, I'd start by paying a visit to Fermina, the Daeva of Song in Sanctum. She'll never admit it, but she's as wise a Daeva as you will ever meet. Oh, and bring along a Divine Lamp when you go. She collects those blasted things. You should see her house, oi! What a Slinks nest! Lamps everywhere!</p>

          <p>2. Class Preceptor's Approval</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that you are mentally prepared, it's time to tackle the next step...obtaining approval from the Preceptors. To start off, gather your nerves and talk to your class Preceptor about writing a letter of recommendation. It's not that bad. Just don't talk to him on a Tuesday...he's never been fond of Tuesdays.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Additionally, you'll need to obtain letters of recommendation from Boreas, Jumentis, Charna, and Thrasymedes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've impressed all of the Preceptors and earned their recommendations, take the letters and an Oath Stone to the High Priest Jucleas in Lyceum of Sanctum. He can perform the Miragent initiation ritual.</p>

          <p>3. Information Gathering</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The next step was added to the Miragent requirements about 100 years ago, by Commander Lavirintos himself. The Commander firmly believed that in addition to tactics and battle skills, anyone who wants to take up the Miragent mantle must also be skilled at pathfinding. His philosophy is that it's no use having the skills to fight if you can't find the enemy. Which I must admit, does actually make sense.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>The Miragent hopeful must locate people, documents, or valuables from various regions of Elysea...with no guides but your own skills and a vague list of locations. Many a Daeva has given up their quest to join the Miragent Holy Templars at this point...after endless months of wandering Elysea. Which...I suppose...is exactly why that wily old Lavirintos is so fond of this task. The old sneak. Anyway, last I'd heard, initiates were being asked to find eight Holy Templars. Let me see if I can recall their names...Nianalo, Navid, Pavel, Pendata...no...Pendaon, Poevius, Belicanon...Mahelnu...and Pater.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you manage to actually finish this task, take an Oath Stone to High Priest Jucleas in Lyceum, for the next phase of the initiation ritual.</p>

          <p>4. Combat Skills</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fourth hurdle you'll face on your way to obtaining your goal is proving your combat skills. The Miragent Holy Templars have the keenest combat skills in Elyos. In fact, rumor has it that they've all got tattoos of Kaisinel on their...never mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To prove your combat worthiness, you'll need to earn The Mark of Eternal Glory. No...really...you can do it. All you need to do is earn more than thirty Decorations of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>OK, that's not exactly easy, but you wouldn't be on this path if you didn't have mad skills. Now, the quickest way I've found to rack up the decorations is to complete individual and party missions in Theobomus...go get 'em!</p>

          <p>5. Crafting Skill</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Crafting. Seems like an odd requirement for a crack military unit, but you never know when these types of skills will mean the difference between a hot dinner or those moldy rations crammed in the bottom of your pack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go with your passion on this one. You're going to have to spend a lot of time learning these skills, so you might as well enjoy yourself. When you get good enough, you'll learn to make a Hot Heart of Magic. That there is the goal. Once you've crafted a heart, present it to the Mater Craftsman Anusis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the heart passes muster, Anusis will give you an Insignia of Miragent imbued with the power of the Heart of Magic. Heady stuff, I know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've got the insignia, take it and a Glossy Oath Stone to High Priest Jucleas in Lyceum of Sanctum for the next stage of the initiation rites.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, you know, I forgot to mention, you're going to need to become a master in at least one crafting skill before you can complete the combat skills test. Never have been able to understand that...but Lavirintos is kind of obsessed with all of that versatility and depth of skills stuff.</p>

          <p>6. Luck and Persistence</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll say it right out front, this test can be a snap or a total roach-filled nightmare...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To pass this hurdle, you'll need to collect twenty Tears of Luck. I'm sure you've heard of them, but if not, they're said to be fragments of Aion's Tower. Tricky little tidbits to harvest. If you touch them they dissolve, so you'll want to visit Sabotes and pick up a tear harvesting tool before you start hunting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're looking for pointers on where to go-a-harvesting, I hear they've been found pretty much everywhere in Elyos, except Poeta and Verteron. One of these days I'm going to check with Fuchsia and find out why that is. I'm sure she'll know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've got the tears, take them and a Oath Stone to High Priest Jucleas in Lyceum of Sanctum for...you guessed it, another rite. Nothing to fret about. You've probably noticed by now that the Miragents may be a bit formal, but they do know how to throw a party!</p>

          <p>7. Loyalty and Unity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The final hurdle to joining the ranks of the Miragent Holy Templars is to prove that you are loyal to Sanctum and work well as part of a team. This can only be done by making friends with others who are preparing for the Miragent Holy Templars test too. Only by working together can you pass this final test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are three stages to the task. First, you and your friends will need to hunt Calydons in the Theobomos region. You'll need to collect 600 Mane Ornaments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After dealing with the Calydons, go to the Eye of Reshanta and fight the Defenders. Then, last thing, pick a fight with the Dredgion Captain...and win.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've completed all three of these tasks, take a Divine Oath Stone to High Priest Jucleas in Lyceum of Sanctum for THE divine ritual of the year. And, when the party adjourns to the Diosysia, look me up...I'll buy you a drink...or two...</p>
