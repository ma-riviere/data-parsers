          <p>The life of a Centurion here is very difficult. This village is devastated and the Lepharists are becoming more active.</p>

          <p>We're responsible for maintaining security. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least, we've set up the Mystic Spring and are working hard on that. Maybe eventually it'll be like the good old days again.</p>
