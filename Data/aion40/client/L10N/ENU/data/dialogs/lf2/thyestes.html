          <p>I would never divulge military information. But occasionally the conversations between the Brigade General and the Centurion make it hard not to laugh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Earlier today, Centurion Malonimus says to Brigade General Telemachus, "It's really lucky that Daevas have those wings, right? Without them, a Daeva with SHORT legs would wear themselves out running after enemies."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank the Seraphim Lords the Brigade General can ignore such a petty insult. If he didn't, there would surely have been a fight. </p>
