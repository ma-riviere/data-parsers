          <p>Huh? Oh, you startled me. I didn't see you coming. You caught me deep in thought....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have so many responsibilities and worries as the Centurion of Agairon Village. The most serious problem is the shortage of clean drinking water, but the food situation isn't much better. We can't hunt enough to keep people fed.</p>
