          <p>It's nice to see new faces around here. I've lived here in Eltnen all my life--my father is the armor merchant for the fortress--but I still don't have many friends here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the kids my age drive me up the wall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's one in particular that I just can't stand. She's the reason I'm hiding out here.</p>

          <p>Admeta. All she ever does is go on and on about being a Daeva. But she isn't a Daeva at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her father is. She's convinced that she'll ascend, but no one else in her family did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sometime wish she would ascend and get out of Eltnen and give us all some peace and quiet. But she'll never ascend. As an old lady, she'll still be here talking about how she will ascend "tomorrow."</p>
