          <p>I'm dealing with a dilemma: who to appoint as Centurion? I need more than a good soldier. A small outpost demands versatility.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take Axelion. Did you know he's a scholar? His knowledge of history and art is invaluable in the Underground Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or Tellarius over there. The rank and file grumble about his strictness, but nobody else has such grace under pressure. And he's a peerless aerial combatant.</p>

          <p>Exactly. But we're the Golden Bough Legion, so I need a gem among gems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On paper, you can't compare a scholar to an aerialist--it's like comparing rutas and basilisks.</p>

          <p>A field test might...illuminate matters.</p>
