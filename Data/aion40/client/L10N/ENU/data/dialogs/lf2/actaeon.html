          <p>To be an archaeologist! My heart leaps when I find relics weathered by the wind or buried under desert sands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like I'm shaking hands with our ancient ancestors. That's why I started doing this in the first place.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Here's a truth: Thousands of years ago there were twelve Empyrean Lords watching over us, not just five. And if the quantity of our leadership changes...</p>

          <p>I'd better stop there, or they'll accuse me of blasphemy. Give that truth some thought.</p>
