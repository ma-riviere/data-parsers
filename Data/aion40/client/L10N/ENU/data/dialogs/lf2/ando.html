          <p>Working in Sataloca's grave is a unique, if sometimes isolating experience. I send things off for approval or authorization, but hear back only occasionally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I get so sick of it, sometimes I just make my own rules--no one's telling me otherwise, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't tell Radamanthys over there, though. He's a stickler for following the rules. "Just because no one's said 'no' doesn't mean it's all right." Brax patties.</p>
