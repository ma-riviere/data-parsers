          <p>Appearances are indeed deceiving: I may be the oldest Daeva you've met. Surprise is written across your face, [%username]...perhaps an explanation's in order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most Daevas ascend as adults, but in some rare cases, like mine, we ascend before we've reached maturity. The Empyrean Lords--for that's what we called them back then--must have had something in mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Suffice it to say that I'm old enough to remember the Cataclysm. So if you ever want an old-timer's perspective, let me know. I've seen it all.</p>
