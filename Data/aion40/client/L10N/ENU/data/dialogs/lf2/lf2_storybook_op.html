          <p>The Final Fragment: a History of the Eltnen Fortress</p>

          <p>Each fortress in Elysea was built near a fragment of the Aion Tower. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most important factor in determining the location of a fortress was the strategic value of these fragments; each fragment is connected to a point in the fixed Abysses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Purely by chance, the last fragment to be discovered was in Eltnen, and thus it was the last fortress to be constructed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Certain other factors also contributed to its late development.</p>

          <p>A nameless forest located in the northwestern end of Eltnen had been well known since ancient times for its lush, abundant flora. Even experienced hunters avoided it, because it was so dense that no one could find their way through it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Within the forest, a thick fog roiled from the air even in the unlikeliest weather, making navigation impossible. Reports of disappearances in this hostile forest kept any sane person from visiting it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But after an Abyss Gate was found in Verteron, Sanctum ordered that all missing persons cases be reopened, and Eltnen's strange forest immediately became a place of great interest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They suspected that some of the disappearances might be related to an undiscovered Abyss Gate.</p>

          <p>An exploration team was assembled in great haste, and dispatched to Eltnen. Lead by the intrepid Daeva Tumblus, the team was well-prepared for the thick fog, and managed to find the place where they would later build the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unintimidated by the fog, Tumblus ordered his team to turn on the Aether lamps they had prepared and, hand in hand, they moved deeper into the forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although the fog blurred their view and thorn bushes snagged at their feet, they continued on, until finally they came to an enormous stone wall. Each of them could clearly sense a great force behind it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But when they illuminated the wall with their Aether lamps, the stone began to collapse, threatening to bury them under tons of stone if they stood their ground. Tumblus had no choice but to order a speedy retreat.</p>

          <p>But he was not to be deterred so easily. After many futile attempts, they managed to push through the collapsed stones, and what they discovered on the other side took their breath away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An indescribably beautiful valley lay before them, divided by a clear river of fresh water, and abundant with food-bearing plants and trees.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>They also found more threats waiting for them. As they got closer to the place where they expected to find an Abyss fragment, they found their feet mired in strange magic. Someone was trying very hard to keep them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Tumblus refused to stop, no matter how great a danger they would face.</p>

          <p>Their determination finally paid off: they overcame all the obstacles in their path, and found the Abyss Gate. A fragment of the tower was floating in a cave in a cliffside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since the Abyss War was in full swing, it was imperative to clean up the area and build a fortress. However, the seemingly permanent fog and unusual geographical features made it very difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, Lord Nezekan, recently returned from a fierce battle in the Abyss, visited the fortress construction site.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His unannounced visit surprised everyone there.</p>

          <p>After examining the site, Lord Nezekan said in a low voice, "What must be hidden is already..." and then chanted a spell, which cleared the fog completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He looked around the construction site again and advised that the fortress should be raised into the sky to make the best use of the Abyss Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although it was difficult, all those in the site agreed to follow the will of Lord Nezekan. After his visit, construction progressed more rapidly.</p>

          <p>With the aid of Lord Nezekan and many powerful Daevas, the tower was elevated and suspended in the sky. They also installed a Hoverstone for better access to the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The area surrounding the fortress and above the precipitous cliff had rugged terrain and an unstable flow of Aether, which turned out to be impossible to fully control. These areas were placed off-limits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In spite of these conditions, the fortress was eventually completed, and entered service to send Daevas to Reshanta.</p>

          <p>Although it was built later than the Verteron Citadel or the NewÂ Heiron Gate, the Eltnen Fortress has a distinguished history.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because of its position, troops transported through the Eltnen Fortress arrived faster than other fortresses. As a result, the Abyss Gate of Eltnen became a key access point to Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many notable Legions, including the Golden Bough Legion, went through the Eltnen Fortress to Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Currently, the most urgent issue that the Daevas of Eltnen Fortress must deal with is stopping the desertification of Eltnen.</p>
