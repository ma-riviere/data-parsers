          <p>Lady Yustiel give us some respite, it's so hot today. Just look at Kibelle over there in the sun. She probably can't wait to get that hot armor off.</p>

          <p>When I was a child, I wished that I would someday learn the secrets of the Observatory. The strange tree atop the building fascinated me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet never did I dream that I would ascend, nor that the Observatory would be in my care. It's not at all like I imagined, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also never thought I'd meet someone like Kibelle here. Someday we'll have more time to spend together.</p>
