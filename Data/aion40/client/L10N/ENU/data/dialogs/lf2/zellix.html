          <p>I don't know why everybody is so worried. The Watch guys are nervous, and so are the old people in the village. They worry about what they should do, where they should go: worry, worry, worry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not as if worrying will solve anything, right? It's not like they're gonna die soon. After all, they have food now, and the village isn't going to turn into desert overnight. They just worry too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When things get really tough THEN we can worry. Worrying too much makes me unhappy. Say...got any wine on you?</p>
