          <p>Once, he was a hero. He took care of the most difficult jobs. But he made a mistake that caused the death of many young villagers. The story is...complicated... I cannot speak of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He fled the village. I thought he was dead. I even wept for him! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now he's back and he's with the Lepharist Revolution. He's been harassing the villagers and keeping us from going to the Mystic Spring. How can he do this to us? And you know what else? I think he was two-timing me with that Priest, Aerope!</p>
