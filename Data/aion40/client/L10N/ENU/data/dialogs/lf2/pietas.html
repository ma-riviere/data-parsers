          <p>Hot enough for you? It never used to be like this.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>I grew up here. I ascended as a Daeva about 70 years ago and left to follow Ariel's call.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But things changed. Aether became scarce. The land became arid. I came back here thinking I might be able to help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But without Aether, there's nothing I can do. Young people are leaving. The old ones have nowhere else to go and won't accept help. I'm just at a loss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I've been gone too long.</p>

          <p>You see Hannet over there? And Margarro who coughs all day long? They were children when I left the village. Dellome and I grew up together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm still blessed with youth, but they're all counting down their last days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate watching everything I cherished fading away. It's one reason Daevas travel, I suppose--the price we pay for serving the Seraphim Lords. But it's a hard one.</p>
