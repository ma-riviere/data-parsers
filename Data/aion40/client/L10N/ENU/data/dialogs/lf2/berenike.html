          <p>I know everything that goes on in Agairon Village. The people of the village organized the Watch to look out for each other. Light knows there's never a Guardian around when you need one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been assisting Priest Aerope since the former Watch leader died. Danger lurks everywhere. She should have kept two eyes on the road ahead and one eye on the road behind her. Or...um...one eye on... Just make sure you keep watch, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure I'll be the Watch Leader soon. I'm the only one really qualified for the job.</p>
