          <p>Hmm... It's not the Aetheric flow detectors, and it's not the alchemical field on the crystals. Why would a Mystic Spring wear out?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah! Greetings, [%username]. My name's Esaias. I'm analysing the Mystic Springs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Seraphim Lady Yustiel remembers Eltnen as fertile, even verdant! That's why she created the many Mystic Springs here. But this drought's draining even their magic dry. We must find the cause before the last ones fail, or there's no hope to revive those that have already dried up!</p>
