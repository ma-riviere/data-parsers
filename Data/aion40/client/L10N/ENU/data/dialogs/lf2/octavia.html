          <p>My childhood dream was to govern this fortress. As a child, I was ignorant, and didn't realize I'd have to ascend to govern a whole region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately I never ascended, so there's no way for me to realize my dream.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For a long time I forgot about my dream, but recently I began to think maybe it isn't impossible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, where there's a will there's a way. </p>

          <p>If I don't have to rule the fortress myself, I just have to rule someone who can. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can govern the person who governs this fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I already know all the fortress commander's favorite foods, and he appears so young....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if he'd want a wife or a mother figure.</p>
