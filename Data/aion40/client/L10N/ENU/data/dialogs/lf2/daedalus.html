          <p>You know what I love about being a Daeva? I can fly!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course there's not as much Aether here as when Atreia was whole, so we can't fly as freely as our ancestors did. Plus, fighting and flying at the same time takes focus. I recommend a good helmet too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But let other Daevas praise the joys of combat--for me the greatest thrill in the Abyss is the beauty of flight. You'll know what I mean when you get there.</p>
