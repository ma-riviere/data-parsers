          <p>Piero</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bounty: 100 million Kinah</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Charge: Treason</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Human. Male in his thirties. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A known mercenary, thief, and killer, he is wanted for treason against Elysea. Masquerading as an armor supplier, he visited Eltnen and stole a map marking the locations of all of the Fountains of Life in the region. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After killing two guards in his escape, he subsequently sold the map to Lepharists, which placed Elyos troops in the area at great risk of attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Piero is intelligent and charismatic, with an uncanny ability to disguise himself and assume new identities. He is skilled in personal combat, but often relies on surprise to gain the advantage on guards or others and murder them before they can raise an alarm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He sometimes convinces unwitting innocents to act on his behalf or to accompany him in his schemes without full understanding of what they're doing.</p>

          <p>Carabosse</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bounty: 70 million Kinah</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Charge: Murder, prison breaking</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva. Female in her early thirties. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Carabosse was a scholar in a village in Poeta when she ascended. Rather than dedicating herself to the betterment of all, she instead used her new abilities to take revenge on several Humans she felt had wronged her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was captured after committing a series of defenestrations, and imprisoned in Verteron. But while imprisoned she murdered a Human prisoner and impersonated her long enough to be placed in a less-secure portion of the prison. As a Daeva she was able to escape easily from that facility.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since that time she has committed many killings that are not related to her former life as a Human, and she may be acting as an assassin for hire. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Carabosse is a serial defenestrator, wanted for at least twenty murders. She is an unrepentant killer, and extremely dangerous.</p>

          <p>Salu</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bounty: 50 million Kinah</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Charge: Fraud, Inciting social disorder</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Human. Female in her late twenties </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Salu is perhaps the most skilled and prolific forger of ancient books in all of Elysea. In the course of her career she has produced hundreds of false works, selling them to both dealers of antiquities and to individual Humans and Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her most recent crimes center around the production of false books of prophesy, which she passes off while posing as an inexperienced antiquities dealer. In this guise, she contacts a Daeva, claiming to have found a reference to them in an ancient book of prophesy. She then offers to sell the book to the individual at a price that seems low for such an ancient tome, but is of course exorbitant for a fake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These works contain nothing of value, and have caused many individuals to do harm to themselves, leave important work unfinished, abandon their posts in battle, and other undesirable actions, all while trying to follow the directions of the false prophesy, believing it to be the will of the Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Salu is by trade an academic, and unskilled in combat, but is remarkable in her ability to inspire trust and cooperation in the innocent. She has been known to travel under the names Dressa, Millae, Sanso, and Frejana, and sometimes uses false credentials from the Library of the Sages at Sanctum as part of her ruse.</p>

          <p>Mirpha (alias, real name unknown)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bounty: 50 million Kinah</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Charge: Larceny</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Human. Her real identity and appearance are unknown </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The criminal known as Mirpha is suspected of several thefts from temples, including those at Verteron Citadel and Tolbas Village. In both cases she used stolen gear, forged papers, and an elaborate disguise to convince the temple officials that she was a Protector of Divinity sent from Sanctum on official business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once she gained the confidence of officials and had access to the temple, she perpetrated a robbery. She used elaborate disguises each time, varying her hair color and even her age. She is also suspected of having stolen goods in Heiron and Sanctum, based on the similarities of those crimes to her known robberies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has on occasion used a false letter of introduction signed by the Priest Hygea of Sanctum.</p>

          <p>Bounty: 50 million Kinah</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Charge: Larceny</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Human. Male in his forties. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kelaino is a criminal with no regard for the harm he causes. He has been incarcerated in the past for physically harming his wife and children, and is suspected of poisoning his former work supervisor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though he is a large man, with a brutish appearance, Kelaino is a brilliant chemist who trained at a university before being dismissed for threatening one of his instructors. He has since used his knowledge to concoct poisons and drugs which he uses for criminal ends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In his most recent crime, he laced the refreshments for temple guards and attendants with a paralysis drug. While they were incapacitated he stole the Glass of Divinity, a valuable artifact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A reliable source reports that he fled to Theobomos, but he may be using one of several false names, including Etraut and Noonan.</p>

          <p>Daeva. Male in his early twenties. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While quarreling with his Human wife, Lasein used a magical attack in a fit of anger and killed her. When guards tried to apprehend him, he assaulted them and escaped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lasein is likely to offer violent resistance to capture, so care should be used in approaching him. His whereabouts are unknown, but he has extended family in Eltnen, and may be hiding there.</p>

          <p>Charge: Treason</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Claims to be Human, but may be a disguised Daeva. Female in her twenties </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Justher was acting as an assistant to a Protector at Verteron Citadel when she was caught trying to steal military secrets. Documents in her possession indicated that she had been corresponding or meeting with Asmodian spies. It is likely she had already revealed several important secrets in return for large payments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shortly after being apprehended, she vanished. It is possible that she fled to Asmodae, but she may still be living in Elysea under another name. While in custody it was noted that she had three parallel scars on her left bicep.</p>

          <p>Human. Male in his late twenties. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Metero is a charming swindler who appears at fancy events or parties and ingratiates himself with women. He doesn't always target wealthy women, and has even been known to seduce female Guardians to steal their weapons and armor. He has also stolen from temples by seducing female priests and acolytes to gain access to the offerings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is currently being sought in connection with a theft from a high-ranking female military officer. While stealing valuables from her home as she slept, he also (likely inadvertently) took several secret government documents.</p>

          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Human. Female in her twenties </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Riala is wanted for impersonating a teleporter on several occasions. After convincing the real teleporter to leave their post under false pretenses, she takes their place. While posing as the teleporter, she then collects fees but sends the victims to a nearby inconvenient place (such as the middle of a lake, or an abandoned quarry), rather than to their actual destination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before the victims can return to challenge her, she flees with her stolen Kinah. In at least one instance she was assisted in her deception by a Human male cohort, but his identity is unknown at this time.</p>
