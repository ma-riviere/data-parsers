          <p>Isn't it a waste of time for Wardens to stay here, guarding the fortress? I wonder...it seems like we should be out there, keeping Eltnen safe for everyone else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We know where the Krall and Lepharist Revolutionaries are stationed, after all. We ought to get out there and take care of them...once and for all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know we're short-handed, but that never changes. Besides, a single Daeva ought to handle, what, a hundred Sapiens or Lepharists, right? </p>

          <p>I know I'm not the only Centurion who feels this way. But for now, I'll wait. I figure [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Telemachus] has a plan.</p>

          <p>If he lived through that, and something out there gives him pause...well, like I said, I figure he's got a plan.</p>
