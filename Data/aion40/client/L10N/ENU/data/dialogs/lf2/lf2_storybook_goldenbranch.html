          <p>This is a legend that has been passed down since ancient times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the beginning, there was chaos throughout the cosmos. To create order in the world, Aion sent Siel, the Guardian of Time, and Israphel, the Guardian of Space. To serve under them he sent the Protectors of Light, Darkness, Life, Death, Justice, Wisdom, Destiny, Freedom, Illusion, and Destruction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Together they were called the Empyrean Lords, and they existed to spread the will of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even poets must have found it difficult to describe them, because the ancients use only vague terms, referring to the Empyrean Lords as 'serene seas' and 'towering mountains'.</p>

          <p>The Empyrean Lords represented Aion's will, and the complex nature of Aion became apparent in the behavior of his agents. The Lords soon formed alliances and enmities with one another.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Light pushes away darkness, darkness produces illusion, illusion mocks destiny, destiny is unable to suppress freedom, freedom longs for wisdom, and wisdom follows illumination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two Empyrean Lords were especially close to each other, but their names cannot be revealed, as this is a story that was never to be told.</p>

          <p>No one knows what made them break the taboo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These two Empyrean Lords met somewhere in Atreia, evading the eyes of the other Empyrean Lords as well as those of Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is said that they met in a deep forest where even hunters have never set foot, in the sky where no Daeva could reach, or in a far ocean where even Seirens dare not go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it doesn't matter where they met. It is more important what they did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The two Empyrean Lords loved each other. They met as frequently as possible, while evading the suspicions of others.</p>

          <p>When their love produced a child, they were overwhelmed by both joy and fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Empyrean Lords, they could not pretend to be ignorant of the will of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, their child was a true blessing. He let them know true happiness. They named him Kahrun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although they were unable to care for Kahrun directly, the two Empyrean Lords wanted to do something for him as any parent would.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus, they built a playground for Kahrun--the biggest and most wonderful playground in all worlds.</p>

          <p>They chose a suitable place, far from any other creature, and cast magic spells upon it to prevent any intrusion. No other being could enter the playground, and it became all but invisible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The two Empyrean Lords, mother and father to Kahrun, placed all kinds of creatures in the playground, from tiny grasses to huge monsters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They wanted Kahrun to experience all aspects of the world, but because his very existence was taboo, he would never be allowed to walk free, so long as he lived. They had to hide him at all costs.</p>

          <p>At first, Kahrun thrived inside the huge playground. To him it seemed to be the entire world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The two Empyrean Lords were so busy looking after important affairs in Atreia that they could not visit him frequently. They felt guilty, and gave Kahrun more and more things to overcome their increasing sense of shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They also feared they would not be able to constrain their son forever.</p>

          <p>However, the most miserable one was Kahrun. Left alone in the huge playground, he grew up without anyone to nurture him. He became more and more violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he realized the power he had, he began to destroy the playground that his parents had built. He found it delightful to take the lives of the creatures imprisoned with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The suffering of his 'toys' meant nothing to him.</p>

          <p>Seeing the change in their child, the two Empyrean Lords became filled with regret and anguish. They decided to beg Aion's pardon and implore him to recognize their child, so that he could be freed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did they decide too late? Or was Aion's rage too immense? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No matter which is true, a catastrophe befell Atreia, and Kahrun's playground became the first victim.</p>

          <p>Hearing a great thunder, the two Empyrean Lords rushed to the playground, only to discover a horrifying sight. The playground was completely destroyed, leaving no trace of life. And Kahrun...was not to be found anywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Overwhelmed by grief, Kahrun's mother screamed in distress. The heartbreaking sound resonated across the land, drawing forth a black rain of grief from the clouds. The two Empyrean Lords turned their backs upon the destroyed playground, and left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The pain of their grief separated them forever.</p>
