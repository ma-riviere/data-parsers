          <p>I'm sorry, [%username]. I'm no longer the cheerful village 'Jester' I once was. My grief is overwhelming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My husband was attacked by Rynoces while out hunting, and...and...he didn't make it. He was leader of the Watch, so he was trying to feed the entire village. But it ended badly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I'll get through this. But it breaks my heart to think of our child growing up without a father. He was so warm, so loving, so giving. If only he had not joined the Watch and looked out for our family instead!</p>
