          <p>Alas, I never imagined I'd be part of the village Watch. I was a talented swordsman! I should have been a Daeva! My parents used to brag about 'their son, the future Daeva!' But it seems that you can't change your own fate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes, I notice people looking at me, and it hurts. I know what they're thinking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was it my parents' fault for bragging about their son? Was that why I didn't ascend? Well, I can't exactly complain to them, can I? They're dead now. Dead and disappointed. Oh, if only I had wings!</p>
