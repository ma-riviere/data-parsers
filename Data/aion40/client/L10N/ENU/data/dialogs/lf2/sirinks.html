          <p>I've been out here for an eternity trying to find why the Mystic Springs are drying up. My colleagues and I are investigating the whole region, but we've made little progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shortage of Aether is one theory, but there are many areas in Elysea with low Aetheric fields. But you don't see Poeta or Sanctum drying up into an arid wasteland.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what's different here?</p>
