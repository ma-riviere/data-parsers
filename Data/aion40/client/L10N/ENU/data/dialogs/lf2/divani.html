          <p>I love me some summer! The leaves are green, the skies are blue, the air is soft!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the best part about summer is the Summer Swap! The Daevas of Summer'll exchange all the Scorching Heat you can find for a nice cool gift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zena] in Sanctum, and she'll set you up. She'll trade you a nice box of coldness for all that yucky heat. I think you'll be surprised!</p>
