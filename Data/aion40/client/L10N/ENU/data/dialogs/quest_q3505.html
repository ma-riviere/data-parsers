          <p>Thanks to you, [%username], I managed to eat something. But now I must worry about feeding the Vigilantes of the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is worse than battle! All they do is eat! I need to find enough ingredients plus some firewood, then cook the meal and do all the washing up afterward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes I think I'd much rather pick up my sword and get back out in the trenches.</p>

          <p>These Vigilantes don't even bother to wash their plates after they've finished. It's like watching Drakes eat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you give me a hand, [%username]? I know you're probably not much of a cook, but if you could find some firewood, that would help me out so much.</p>

          <p>If only the Vigilantes were as considerate as you, Daeva. Thank you.</p>

          <p>You've done this before so you know what I need, yes? Just find me about a dozen [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_1591a]s...the staffs of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spectre_41_An]s from the Patema Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They seem to burn forever. Not even the heavy winds here can put them out.</p>

          <p>I'll have a word with the priest. But the last time I asked for an assistant, he sent me a Shulack. Little beast ate everything in front of his face.</p>
