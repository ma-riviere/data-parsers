          <p>[%username], I'm grateful for what you did for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...Monitors seem to reproduce really quickly. They're everywhere again. I think it's part of why they're so creepy to me.</p>

          <p>I've been dealing with this for years. I thought being here might help me face my fears, but....</p>

          <p>No, it's not, especially since you're the first person outside my family who's ever known about it.</p>

          <p>I understand. Killing Monitors isn't exactly high priority work for Daevas, is it?</p>

          <p>I suppose that's one reason why this fear is so embarrassing to me.</p>
