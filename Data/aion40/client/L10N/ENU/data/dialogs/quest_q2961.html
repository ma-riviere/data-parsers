          <p>I need you to go to the Shadow Court, and speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Srudgelmir]. This is a personal matter, so keep it private. For now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a judge, so it's most likely something important. If you're after Kinah, he'll be able to reward you fairly. Interested?</p>
