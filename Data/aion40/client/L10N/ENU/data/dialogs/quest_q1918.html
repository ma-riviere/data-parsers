          <p>Ah, [%username]. I have a confession to make and a favor to ask.</p>

          <p>First, the confession. Ready for a surprise...?</p>

          <p>I am seeing Namus!</p>

          <p>I know, I know...but I can't help myself! On the one hand, he's so rugged, but on the other hand, he's enough of a romantic to resort to ridiculous schemes like stealing my clothes to make me fall in love!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I went to Poeta, the poor man was scared half out of his skin. He begged for my forgiveness and, as we were talking, I saw this charming, sweet side to him...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someday I'd like him to move to Sanctum and live with me but until then, we'll get together whenever I'm in Poeta.</p>

          <p>Well, love can grow in the unlikeliest of gardens, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That was the confession. Here's the favor: I spoke with Anteros and commissioned an Ax of Silibaros for Namus. An Ax of Silibaros's blade stays sharp no matter what, so Namus will be the most productive woodcutter in all of Daminu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anteros says the axe is ready. But I have a small emergency--a family matter--I must attend to. [%username], can you get the axe from Anteros, then meet me back here?</p>

          <p>As for me, I'll visit Anteros myself tomorrow, and Namus will get his axe eventually.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, but I don't have the time for a smithing lesson at the moment. I'm trying to work through these private commissions as fast as I can.</p>

          <p>If you have an immediate need, just talk to the merchants. They stock good, sturdy weapons--even if they are a little expensive.</p>

          <p>Is it true that Seirenia is seeing a woodcutter from Poeta? It must be serious, if she's giving him an axe like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For decades, I've been making Axes of Silibaros for the war effort. To make one for a mere woodcutter seems like a waste of time and materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But a commission is a commission, eh? Here's the axe. I just hope Seirenia's woodcutter friend gives it the respect such a fine weapon deserves.</p>

          <p>You brought back the axe, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What a relief! Even when Anteros tells you something is done, that doesn't mean you'll actually get it. If he spots a tiny flaw when he's polishing a completed weapon, he'll throw it out and start over from scratch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Namus wouldn't mind--or even notice, I suppose--a minuscule flaw, but he'll be disappointed if he doesn't get this axe soon.</p>
