          <p>Adma Stronghold is a horrific place. It crawls with the diseased, the dead, and the dying, because of one woman--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_PricessNamed_50_Ah].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was thoughtless, vain beyond belief, and spent Kinah on elaborate parties without regard for her family's dwindling wealth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And yet, she was blessed with such beauty that men courted her day and night, happily ignoring her despicable nature. Eventually, she  met the Lord of Adma Castle, and not long after that, his wife died....</p>

          <p>Yes, and when Brusthonin was struck by a terrible epidemic, Princess Karemiwen ordered the castle gates shut.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hundreds flocked to the castle--all were refused. None were sick, but even after she knew that, Karemiwen refused to open the gates. One by one they were taken by slow and agonizing starvation, betrayed by those to whom they had sworn fealty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Princess Karemiwen still lives, [%username]. I have passed judgment on her, and must avenge those who died through her actions. Will you help me?</p>
