          <p>I've been hearing some alarming reports out of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_D] that the Balaur are developing some new [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3704a]s. We have a hard enough time keeping up with their current ones, so I hate to think what'll happen when these new ones go into production.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only thing to do is to get our hands on some, so that we can develop countermeasures. They most likely keep them in [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAB1_MiniCastle_DragonArms_Q3704]s inside the Training Fortress. Your task would be to fight your way in there and get your claws on some. You game?</p>

          <p>Good warriors are invaluable, but good weapons count nearly as much.</p>

          <p>If you've brought the prototypes from the training camp, I'd love to see them.</p>

          <p>Hmm. These don't look much like Balaur [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3704a]s. I'm going to need more than twisted bits of scrap to send to our weaponsmiths.</p>

          <p>Yes... interesting. This is fine work, considering the Balaur made it. Normally their stuff lacks in what you might call subtlety, but you have to hand it to them, these are quite innovative.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for getting hold of them! I'll have our weaponsmiths take a look at them right away.</p>

          <p>Instructor Kelmar said that the Balaur were testing newly developed weapons in the Nochsana Training Camp, and asked you to get hold of some.</p>

          <p>When you returned with your haul, Kelmar was quite relieved to have something for the weaponsmiths to study, and base their countermeasures off.</p>
