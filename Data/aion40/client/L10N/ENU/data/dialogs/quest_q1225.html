          <p>As you can see, the reward is an Iron Coin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That way, you use the funds to help purchase something ever you need, rather than having me try to guess what you would like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I always guess wrong.</p>

          <p>Have you been in possession of Coins before?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We use them as a reward currency. You can purchase a range of unique items with them, but only from a contribution reward officer or administration officer like me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, I'll show you how they work.</p>

          <p>When you are ready to spend your Coins, make sure to speak with the right administration officer for your class, as we carry different items. I carry items for combat classes, and Laskis specializes in items for the magic classes.</p>

          <p>Here's the extra rewards I promised you. Spend it wisely.</p>
