          <p>You avenged my friends for me--I should go turn myself in. I did escape after all. But there's something I have to do first for...safety reasons. I...have a serious illness. A lethal illness...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every night, I...become a Worg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Years ago, a vicious old Asmodian witch cursed me. She proclaimed I would live my whole life in solitude. At the time I didn't really think about it, but within a few days, I learned how bad it really was. I awoke in a strange place surrounded by blood. Angry strangers watched me with fear in their eyes.</p>

          <p>I have a cryptic clue to breaking the curse: "Bathe the beast in waters twice fallen from under, a pool no sun shall see." There's more...I think the rest of the saying was put there just to force the rhyme, but that's the important part.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I found the exact location here in the cave--Stalactite Spring. The problem is that I have to bathe when I'm a Worg. But in that state, my body is beyond my control.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], would you wait until I turn into a Worg and bring me to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2B_SZ_D_1]?</p>

          <p>I have no control of myself as a Worg. I'll probably fight you. But Worgs are beasts like Asmodians. They understand a hierarchy of strength. If you subdue me, you should be able to get me to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2B_SZ_D_1].</p>
