          <p>We still don't know much about the geography and situation here. It puts us in a tough position both strategically and tactically.</p>

          <p>We need someone to scout Nolantis Ruins and The Storm Circle. We know the area is full of undead, but we need to know where they are and how they fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We also need to stop them from resurrecting. We've already got some research that points to a solution--your job will be collect the specific items we need.</p>
