          <p>Everyone knows that Brusthonin used to be a fertile farmland, but there's another side to this area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before coming here, I read every book about Brusthonin I could get my hands on. I figure there's got to be plenty of ways to turn a profit out here, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I learned about the Brusthonin Mithril Mine. It's abandoned, as far as I can tell, hardly anybody else knows about it, so there could still be a lot of Mithril in there.</p>

          <p>Oh, you don't have to mine it. If I'm right, nobody's been in there since the Cataclysm. There should be plenty of ore already mined, just lying about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what I'd like you to do is go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2B_SZ_A2_2] and pick up something from the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2a_Mineral_Q4099] for me.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>I'll assay the quality, and pay you accordingly. The undead around the mine keep everyone else out, but I figure you should be able to walk right in and get the sample!</p>

          <p>Great! I had a feeling we'd get along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some people think we should leave everything in Brusthonin just as it was after the Cataclysm, out of respect for the dead. But these people have been dead a long time, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's best for everyone if we make the best use of the available resources.</p>
