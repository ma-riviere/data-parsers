          <p>Well...it seems that you're a rather promising cook. With a little guidance you could become a top chef, maybe open your own restaurant here in Pandaemonium.... </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cooking isn't just about standing behind a hot stove. Other tasks are necessary to keep the whole operation working. Right now, I need you to run an errand for me.</p>

          <p>No, you're going on a trip...to the Abyss. It's quite simple. Really.</p>

          <p>Ah, the Chikra frying powder. Just in time! Thank you, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Shards! This is a measly amount, but I'll stretch it out as best I can.</p>

          <p>I'm in your debt. If you hadn't have come, I'd be feeding them old boots and qooqoo droppings. Now where did I put that pan...?</p>
