          <p>Based on what we know, there's a link between the Lepharist Research Center in Heiron and the Alquimia Stronghold in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to find out what's in the Suspicious Box. And we'd also better find out what [%dic:STR_DIC_M_EeA_LehparWiD_44_Ae]s are doing.</p>

          <p>It was the same as her access card to the Alquimia Stronghold. Lethe will look for other means to investigate the Suspicious Box.</p>
