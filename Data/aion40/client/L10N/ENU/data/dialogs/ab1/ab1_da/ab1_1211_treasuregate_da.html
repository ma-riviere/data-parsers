          <p>Nothing is clearly known about the Chamber of Roah in the Ruins of Roah. It's only recently been discovered, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One thing we know is that the Balaur stay there and collect treasures. It's rather disconcerting to have Balaur so close, truth be told.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do know how to get in, don't you?</p>

          <p>Do you see the old statue around the corner? Well, it maintains a spell that admits Asmodians to the Underground Fortess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur know nothing of it, but if you knock on that statue, you'll get through. Be prepared, though--you'll be facing the Balaur as soon as you get inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're lucky, you can collect Balaur treasures. If you wait too long, however, they disappear. The Balaur have their own magic, you know.</p>
