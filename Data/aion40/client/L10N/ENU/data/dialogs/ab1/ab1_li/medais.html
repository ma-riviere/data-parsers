          <p>I heard that some of the soldiers on the lower layer aren't getting along.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It's shameful. I only hope the Asmodians don't find out about such things and exploit them. Take it as a lesson. We must put aside our differences and work as one to achieve victory.</p>
