          <p>Centurion Laius has experience and skill worthy of respect. He's practically a walking textbook on combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's not popular, though. He doesn't mince words, and when you tell the truth sometimes people don't like what they hear, you know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's harsh to his soldiers, but he's just trying to make sure they have the best chance for survival. Tough training makes for tough soldiers.</p>
