          <p>Are you here to receive a prayer of blessing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, it seems to me being a priest is a great job. I mean, the prayers of blessing are almost identical every time. How hard is that?!</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>All they do is pray, and they get so much respect for it. I should have become a priest. Being an Archon is far too difficult.</p>
