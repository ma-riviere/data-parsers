          <p>You look a little...irritated. Are you all right?</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>Relax. These are difficult times. If you want to stay alive, you've got to keep your cool.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why even the most experienced Guardians get killed by petty enemies. They don't relax. They don't focus on the task at hand. I've seen it over and over again.</p>

          <p>Practice. Control. Remember to breathe. Don't fight out of anger.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Menelaus doesn't listen to my advice; his temper gets the better of him. Myrrha doesn't care about who wins; she's only interested in the combat itself.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their behavior, if continued, will eventually get them killed. Be smart. Be focused. Be calm and you'll stay alive.</p>
