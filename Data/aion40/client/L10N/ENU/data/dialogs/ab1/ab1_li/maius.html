          <p>Did you see what was rising in the northern sky? It's the Aetherora. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legend says that the Aetherora rises in red color if a Daeva Vanishes. Perhaps we should check our ranks to see if any are missing?</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some people say that the Aetherora is beautiful, but it seems ominous to me.</p>
