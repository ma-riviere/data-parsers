          <p>Sometimes I think we spend too much time shuffling our troops from fortress to fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We send help to our comrades at another fortress, and then we get ambushed en route or we leave ourselves vulnerable here.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every move is a calculated risk. But then I suppose every decision to stay put is also a risk, eh?</p>
