          <p>Nothing is clearly known about the Chamber of Roah in the Ruins of Roah. It's only recently been discovered, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One thing we know is that the Balaur stay there and collect treasures. It's rather disconcerting to have Balaur so close, truth be told.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do know how to get in, don't you?</p>

          <p>Do you see that statue over there? Well, knock on that statue, and you'll find yourself in the Chamber of Roah--surrounded by Balaur treasure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, maybe not surrounded, but it's down there. As long as you're prepared to fight Balaur when you get down there, you'll be able to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Show up unprepared, and you won't walk away with any treasure. Take too long and you won't either. The treasure's warded to vanish!</p>
