          <p>Magnair and I were classmates at the temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We came from similar backgrounds and got along well. We became close friends.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Magnair was nice, but pretty timid. He scared easily  and had a tough time with training, so I helped him with things. Now I wonder if I shouldn't have....</p>

          <p>Magnair came to rely on me too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I volunteered for the Red Hasia Legion, he did the same. I told him he didn't have to become an Archon or volunteer for front-line duty, but he insisted!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although he's become a Daeva, he still hasn't found a calling. He's just following in my shadow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really shouldn't have let him lean on me so much. I regret it more and more every day.</p>
