          <p>I used to think that I was quite decent as an Archon, but when I came to Reshanta, I realized that the world is bigger than I imagined.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I find myself becoming more and more timid since I joined the Protector of Primum Legion. Everyone else is so much more experienced.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we're looking for a chance to retake the Kysis Fortress. It looks difficult, but I have faith that we will be victorious.</p>
