          <p>Have you talked to Priest Ganglot? I think he's simply amazing. Purifying dozens of spirits everyday is no ordinary task, but he makes it look easy. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I always thought a Daeva ought to be a warrior, but now I think being a priest is equally as great.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you think about it, warriors destroy life while priests give strength to life and purify it. Perhaps that is the more noble pursuit.</p>
