          <p>Blast, I'm out of bread again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried to save some from yesterday but it was so delicious I ate it all. I wish they'd give us bread at every meal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dagr is always asking for more meat. Bah! I don't really care for meat. Too greasy.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bread is the tastiest of all foods. Mmmm.</p>

          <p>Hmm...all bread is good, of course, but I really love Alderon bread. You can only get it from a village called Aldelle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've never tasted another bread as sweet and delicious before. It isn't flashy, but you could say it's faithful to the fundamentals. Fundamentals of bread.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>It goes perfectly with hot Briga Soup.</p>
