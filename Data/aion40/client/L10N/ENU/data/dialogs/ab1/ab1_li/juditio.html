          <p>Winning a battle requires many skills, and winning a war requires ALL skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, rather than pick up a sword, I decided to find a different way to contribute to the war. So I began to study explosives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Granted, it's not the safest profession--in some ways it's more dangerous than going to battle, but now people treat me as a specialist.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm respected, and I'm helping to win battles. What more could anyone want? Oh, you might not want to stand so close to those barrels....</p>
