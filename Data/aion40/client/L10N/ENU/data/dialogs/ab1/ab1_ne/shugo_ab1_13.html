          <p>Akakak, here to buy Tigraki Workshop items, yes? Daeva has both skill and refinement, it is true.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shall Agemonerk tell the reason why they are so special? Made with Balaur's bones and skins, akakak! Completely different bodies from Shugos or Humans. Very difficult to work, best materials possible for weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not even Weaponsmithing or Armorsmithing masters can duplicate Tigraki items.</p>
