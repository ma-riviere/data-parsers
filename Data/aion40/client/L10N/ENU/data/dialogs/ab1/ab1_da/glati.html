          <p>I am known for my exceptional combat capabilities, not my scouting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have beaten the Elyos and the Balaur many times, and know their weaknesses quite well.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>It drives me crazy standing around the tower and waiting for the fight to come to me.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I do is wait and watch for a glimpse of an enemy and hope Scout Leader Sinjah will let me loose on one. </p>
