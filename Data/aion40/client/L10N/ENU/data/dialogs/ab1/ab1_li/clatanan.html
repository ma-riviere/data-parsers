          <p>I've always been interested in details. That's how I ended up as a quartermaster. I have to be sure everything's recorded and distributed properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may seem tedious to you, but it's extremely important. Without me, there'd be chaos--no one would have the supplies they need.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the pay is good, and I get to stay out of most of the fighting. That's a nice benefit.</p>
