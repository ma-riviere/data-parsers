          <p>I'm pretty new here, and the Abyss is so...massive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I barely managed to learn the names of the fortresses, but I'm hopeless with their locations. All this floating stuff really messes with my sense of direction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm okay as long as I stay in the fortress, but what will happen when they station me outside, or at a bind point?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No commander will want an Archon who gets lost! I'm really afraid for my career.</p>
