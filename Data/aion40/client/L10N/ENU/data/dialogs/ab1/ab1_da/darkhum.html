          <p>I'm risking a fate worse than Munin's by saying this, but I fear we Asmodians are doomed. All because we place lineage and connections above all else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at me. I haven't reached the rank of master even though I have no equals in the whole of Asmodae. None! Instead, I wander place to place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How can the Asmodians ever defeat the Balaur or the Elyos when we value social links and heritage over ability and talent?</p>
