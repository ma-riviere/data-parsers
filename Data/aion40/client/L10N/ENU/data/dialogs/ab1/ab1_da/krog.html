          <p>Working inside is too cushy. I prefer outdoor duties. The frontlines are best. But any outdoor spot is great for rock hunting!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I collect rocks. I enjoy it! Whenever I'm assigned to a new location, I collect stones from the area. They're amazingly beautiful! Each is unique.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>To you they might be useless stones, but to me they are precious souvenirs, containing nature's mysteries and my profound memories.</p>
