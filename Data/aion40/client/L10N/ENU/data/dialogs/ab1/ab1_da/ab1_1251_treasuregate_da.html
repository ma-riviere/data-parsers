          <p>Welcome to the Asteria Fortress. This city has the most beautiful weather in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a cave where trees grow and water flows under the Asteria Floating Island--the Asteria Chamber. Unfortunately, Balaur currently occupy it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know how to get there? I'd be glad to tell you if you don't.</p>

          <p>Do you see the picture on the wall over there? That's the Asteria Chamber--and the secret passage to get there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur are unable to use the passge because of the magic involed, but Asmodians are free to pass through. Just knock on the painting.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Do be sure that you're prepared to take on the Balaur if you go. Those who are successful can find treasure boxes...those who are not find themselves back in the Aether's flow.</p>
