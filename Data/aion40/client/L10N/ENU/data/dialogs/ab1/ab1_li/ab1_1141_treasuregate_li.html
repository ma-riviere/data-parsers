          <P>It's the secret passageway to the chamber. It was built long before we arrived, so we have no idea who actually constructed it.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Just remember to act quickly as soon as you get in, [%username]. Take your time, and you'll miss out on the treasure.</P>
