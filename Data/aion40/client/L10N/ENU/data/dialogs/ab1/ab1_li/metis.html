          <p>I feel proud of working in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My parents in Sanctum are worried that their precious daughter is in danger, but since I decided to live as a Guardian, this is the best place for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, this experience is essential to a Guardian. It's a gate that a Guardian has to pass through at least one time in his or her life.</p>

          <p>I make sure Centurion Minerva has all of the information she needs to make good decisions, and that all of her orders are relayed to her subordinate officers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some people think I know all kinds of things about her private life, but I don't. Even if I did, it would be confidential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She did ask me to feed her Griffon meat once while she was in Sanctum, but that was strictly official.</p>
