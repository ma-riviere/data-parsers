          <p>Did you come to fight the horror? Or to fight me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With my reputation, you're curious about how I fight, aren't you? Are you strong enough? Is your stomach strong enough for it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why do you think I left the Red Hasia Legion? It's better to fight alone than alongside all those weaklings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So stop bothering me and just go back to where you came from.</p>
