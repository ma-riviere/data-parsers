          <p>I was there when the Siel's Eastern Fortress fell to the enemy. Even thinking of it makes me angry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It really was an absurd situation. Almost as if it were someone's conspiracy. So many things went wrong. In the end we had to withdraw.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we must start from nothing in our effort to recapture the fortress.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>We lost it just like that. Shameful, I say!</p>
