  A Place Called Primum</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>As soon as Asmodian sages gained a basic understanding of Reshanta and the Abyss, Pandaemonium immediately ordered the construction of a fortress to serve as a bind point--and a launching point for further exploration of this mysterious region.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>In those early days, many Asmodian Daevas vanished while venturing in the unfamiliar Abyss, never to return. Erecting an Obelisk in Reshanta was of paramount importance.</p> 
  <p> </p> 
  <p>But those early explorers discovered just what the Shedim Lords required: a floating island in the northeast part of Reshanta's lower layer--it was perfect location for the first Asmodian fortress in the Abyss, and they dubbed it "Primum."</p>

          <p>Primum had all the qualities the Shedim Lords were looking for: a stable foundation of heavy, metallic rocks, a moderate, cyclic Aether flow, and a cool, constant climate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, with its proximity to the Ridges of Latesran, Primum could serve as a jumping-off point for Legions deploying to the upper reaches of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once initial plans were drawn, Archons began construction of the fortress walls, and a new legion, the Protectors of Primum, began patrols to protect the workers.</p>

          <p> Chapter 2. Perfidy From the Elyos</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Among Primum's curiosities were the vestiges of outer walls built before the Cataclysm--possibly parts of the Tower of Eternity itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those structures were incorporated into the new foundation. The Archons reconnected broken bridges, and razed or rebuilt the pre-Cataclysm walls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All of Asmodae awaited Primum Fortress's completion. But other eyes were watching Primum as well--the eyes of the Elyos, who also sought a stable island suitable for a fortress in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>When Primum Fortress was about half complete, the Elyos assaulted it for the first time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Despite numerical disadvantage, the Elyos forces attacked desperately, and Asmodian commanders concluded that the Elyos--having failed to find a comparable location for their own fortress, wished to seize Primum for themselves. This view seemed borne out by the fact that the Elyos attacked only Asmodian troops, rather than the fortress itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Protector of Primum Legion earned accolades from all of Asmodae that day, fighting with great valor and driving off the Elyos while suffering only light casualties.</p>

          <p> Chapter 3. Repelling the Balaur</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After the Elyos retreated in disarray, Pandaemonium accelerated construction of the fortress. When the fortress entered the last stage of construction, it faced its first true test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur invaded en masse. Intent on attacking the fortress rather than just probing its defenses, they launched a full-scale offensive from the start. They attacked from above and below Primum fortress, forcing the Protector of Primum Legion to defend in all directions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aetheric Field surrounding the fortress was still incomplete, so Asmodian casualties were horrific--even today the exact losses aren't known. The Balaur attack also destroyed or damaged many of the fortress's completed structures. </p>

          <p>But all was not lost; Primum's Obelisk was already in place, which lowered casualties. The Protectors slowly retreated under Balaur pressure, defending the Obelisk and the Soul Healers until the very end. Using misdirection and clever screening, they kept the Daevas of Construction working on the Aetheric Field Generator even as the battle raged around them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the new fortress gates fell, remnants of an Elyos force attacked Primum as well, throwing the battle into a three-way melee.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Protector of Primum Legion paid for victory with sweat, blood, and Asmodian strength, holding the invaders off long enough for the Daevas of Construction to finish their work and turn on Aetheric Field Generator. At the same time, the Red Hasia Legion and Thunder Shout Legion arrived from Pandaemonium, scattering the Balaur horde across the Abyss.</p>

          <p> Chapter 4. The Struggle Continues</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After Asmodae's Legions repelled the Balaur, Daevas of Construction made it their top priority to strengthen the Aetheric Field around Primum Fortress. Using metals brought from Atreia, they erected dual rings surrounding the entire perimeter of the floating island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the Shedim Lords themselves inscribed runes of power on the rings--an arduous task, but one that rendered the Aetheric Field nearly invincible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To this day, every Protector of Primum Legionary knows that the final rallying points for defenders are the Obelisk and the Aetheric Field Generator.</p>

          <p>Shortly after the rings' completion, Asmodian agents learned that the Elyos had begun the construction of their own fortress on an island named Teminon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that first, savage Balaur attack cost Asmodae precious time. If not for the losses suffered in that battle, Azphel's chosen might have won uncontested control of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But as all Asmodians know, regrets are for the weak. None can say that Asmodae lacks the strength to emerge victorious. As I write this, the Elyos have completed their Teminon Fortress, and the three-way war for the Abyss is beginning in earnest. I have no doubt that I'll one day pen a second volume: "The Invasion of Elysea."</p>
