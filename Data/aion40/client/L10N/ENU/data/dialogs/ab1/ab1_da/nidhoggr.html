          <p>The Island of Stalk is the second most strategic point we control. Only the Primum Landing is more important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we lost control of this island, it would be more difficult for us to move between the upper and lower layers of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why the Ridges of Latesran in the east and west are being defended by a legion under direct control of the Governor. </p>
