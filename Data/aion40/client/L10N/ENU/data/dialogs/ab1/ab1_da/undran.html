          <p>I was sent here to guard the supply depot. Then one day Fyra asked me to help with arranging supplies. Simple enough, so I decided to lend a hand.</p>

          <p>Now I'm doing everything from arranging supplies to distributing them. Fyra hardly does a thing, yet who's collecting the pay, do you suppose?</p>
