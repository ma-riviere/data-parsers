          <p>Ah, the mind is so capricious!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After you brought me the Topaz, I began to think about how to make my new hairpin. As I was thinking it over, I came up with a wonderful new design! Something quite grand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have this idea for the most lustrous hairpin!</p>

          <p>It's a Topaz hairpin studded with Aquamarine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it would be so beautiful--they would compliment each other perfectly. Also, Aetheric energy moves through Aquamarine well, so it can boost your stamina.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you acquired the Topaz so easily, I thought I would ask if you were interested in getting some [%dic:STR_DIC_DG_jewelry_n_c_20b] for me. I would reward you, of course!</p>

          <p>The Shugo merchant said that Aquamarine is a jewel associated with water. Well, I suppose the transparency is a lot like water.</p>

          <p>It really is a water jewel, isn't it? It sparkles like water. Now all I need to do is to ask the best Handicrafting Master to craft the hairpin.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much, Daeva. I wish I would give you more, but this is all I have.</p>
