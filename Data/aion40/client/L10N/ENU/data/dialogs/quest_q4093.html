          <p>Even here, my work is not done. The Princess lies dead, true, but her Lord still walks our lands.</p>

          <p>The very worst--cowardice! He was pitiful. He was putty under the Princess's influence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When his people came, desperate for sanctuary, he did nothing. He had become weak and pathetic.</p>

          <p>The castle gates were closed because the Princess wished it, but it was [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_DeathknightNamed_50_Ah] who gave the order. Now one of the unholy pair has been judged, we must turn our attention to the other.</p>

          <p>Yes. Brusthonin cannot be restored while he draws breath.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it, [%username]. The region was devastated because of Lannok and his Princess. Now Brusthonin is slowly finding its feet once again, yet [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_DeathknightNamed_50_Ah] still lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He must be destroyed. Brusthonin must be rid of him once and for all. Will you accept this task for me?</p>

          <p>Good. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Adma_DeathknightNamed_50_Ah] is in the collapsed observation post atop the Adma Stronghold.</p>

          <p>The Cataclysm shaped us as a people, and Lord Lannok's inaction shaped Brusthonin. So as we war with the Elyos for their cowardice, we must kill Lannok for his crimes.</p>
