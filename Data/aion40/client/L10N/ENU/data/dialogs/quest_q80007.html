          <p>You know what? Daeva's Day has inspired me to do something I've wanted to do for years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Being a Daeva of Blessing is so boring on any other day but today. All I do is give Azphel's blessings to those about to go to war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'm going to do what I ascended to do! I'm going to become...a Daeva of Silly Hats!</p>

          <p>Why not? There's a Daeva of Criticism, for crying out loud! Who'd want to be around him?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the things that inspired me to follow my dreams is these cute Heart Headbands I'm giving away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you'd have to do to get one is enter and play this special event I'm running. Would you like to participate?</p>

          <p>Yay! To get the Heart Headband, you need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80007a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MerdionWhiteD_38_n]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkFiD_39_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CuresD_40_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CuresD_42_An]s to get them, though. They'll be tied onto them somewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've had such a good Daeva's Day, doing what I love. Hopefully I'll be able to do this all the time. Good luck!</p>

          <p>Silly hats are the foundation on which Asmodae was built! Only those who are strong and confident in mind and spirit can truly laugh at themselves!</p>

          <p>Giving away these Heart Headbands is a perfect way to start my new path. Did you get the coupons so I can give one to you?</p>
