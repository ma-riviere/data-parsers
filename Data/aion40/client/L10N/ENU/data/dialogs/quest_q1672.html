          <p>Another frivolous request from the useless Daevas back in Sanctum. Aren't they having just such a wonderful grand ball back there, prancing around in gossamer fineries while we Guardians have to deal with the Balaur with no reinforcements in sight!</p>

          <p>I received a message from Hestia in Sanctum. Somehow--I don't know how--she heard that the Krall had a special dumpling recipe.</p>

          <p>She's sent a request for us to get that recipe and send it back to her, and somehow, she got enough political pull to make this an urgent matter!</p>
