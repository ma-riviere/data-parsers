          <p>Oh, sorry [%username], I didn't see you there. I was thinking about the animals in Sudorville. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't seem to diminish their numbers, and it seems like the last attack only made them angrier. I should have improved our defenses before trying to hunt them.</p>

          <p>Absolutely. If you've got the time, and you'd like to hunt some wild animals, I won't turn down help from a mighty Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, there's Kinah in it for you as well, maybe enough to compensate you for your time. What do you say?</p>

          <p>I really appreciate the help, [%username]. With your experience, it'll be easier and safer for you than the others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd recommend that you focus your efforts on hunting 20 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CuresSpotD_45_An]s and 30 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_KalnifSpotD_45_An]s in Sudorville.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can thin their numbers some more, we might stand a chance. Good hunting!</p>

          <p>I understand. Who wouldn't want help from a skilled individual like you?</p>

          <p>That was fast. Some of the hunters who left before you haven't come back yet. I hope they didn't get eaten.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What happens to a Daeva who gets eaten alive, anyay? Do you appear back at an Obelisk right away? Or do you digest for a while first?</p>
          <p> </p>
