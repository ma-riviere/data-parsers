          <p>The Kysis Isle is like a furnace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The intolerable heat affects the morale of our soldiers, but the most serious problem is that it bends weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the weapons we use in the Abyss are made by masters and thus highly resistant to heat. However, some swords and bows do bend slightly when exposed too long to heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you know, weapons are very sensitive objects. If they're deformed just a little, they can become far less effective.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a solution, but it's too time consuming for me to carry out myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If possible, I'd like to ask you a favor. What do you think?</p>

          <p>According to Moirai, the Heart of a Greedy Beast is highly resistant to fire. He thinks we can protect the weapons by coating them with an extract from the heart flesh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately there's a good population of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_Pretor_38_An]s on this island, and every one of them has a heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>10 will be enough, I think.</p>

          <p>I'll need that many to coat all of the weapons. I can't leave any soldiers with weapons that might fail in the heat.</p>

          <p>This is amazing. I thought they would be hot because they're resistant to fire, but instead they're cold as ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I better get busy. Extracting the compounds from the hearts takes time, and I want it to be done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, wait a moment! There may not be enough to coat all the weapons if we get some new recruits. If you get more hearts, please bring them to me as well.</p>

          <p>Musai was worried that weapons might be deformed by the heat of Kysis Isle and fail in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was fortunate that Moirai knew the solution: an extract from the hearts of Greedy Beasts can be used to make weapons resistant to fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Following Musai's instructions, you defeated Greedy Pretors and took their hearts to her. Afraid that the hearts you brought her would not be enough, she asked you to bring her any Heart of Greedy Beast you may find.</p>
