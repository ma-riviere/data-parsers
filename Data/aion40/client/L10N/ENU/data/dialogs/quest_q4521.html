          <p>Ah, [%username]! Thanks for responding so quickly. I was afraid it might take a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A priest in Brusthonin asked me to send news of what happens here in Beluslan. I gathered all sorts of information for her, but I don't want to send such a sensitive document through normal means.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd feel better if a trusted courier were to take it directly to her, and you seem trustworthy enough. Can you help me?</p>

          <p>Thanks! I knew I could count on a Daeva like you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deliver it to Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hort] at Baltasar Hill Village. Make sure you put it in no one's hands but hers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And don't read it yourself, either. Sorry, but as I said, there's some sensitive information in there not meant for the general public.</p>

          <p>Can't do it? That's okay--I'm sure you're not the only one headed that way. Looks like it'll take longer to find someone than I hoped, though.</p>

          <p>Ah, yes, Gaamel's information. You came all the way here to deliver it personally? Gaamel has a strong sense of duty, worthy of an Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I find that keeping current on what is happening in other regions helps my work here. Some problems are universal, but solutions can be unique, down to individuals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have requested this information from many regions, but Beluslan is the first to respond. Thank Gaamel for his time and trouble.</p>
