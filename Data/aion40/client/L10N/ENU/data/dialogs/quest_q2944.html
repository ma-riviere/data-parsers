          <p>I've never really paid you much attention. [%userclass] matters bore me to tears, if I'm honest. But now I've seen your ability at Tailoring...well, perhaps there is something more to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been wanting to retire, to live out a peaceful life, at one with nature, far removed the bustle of Pandaemonium. But so far there's been no one with the talent to replace me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you could be that person. And you could help me out right away, if you like.</p>

          <p>In a word, time. There's not enough of it. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Baht] in the Abyss wanted me to prepare this robe for him, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently it was a custom order from one of his more valued clients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's due for delivery today but, as you can see, I'm tied up here. Will you deliver it to him?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Take this package, and be careful not to drop it, now. That material stains, you know!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all packed up in there. I tried to make it as easy to carry as possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, hurry. Baht must be getting anxious, and the Abyss is no place for anxiety.</p>

          <p>Well, I suppose you must have other responsibilities. But don't underestimate the importance of decent attire. Ask anyone in the Vanahal District and they'll tell you the same.</p>
