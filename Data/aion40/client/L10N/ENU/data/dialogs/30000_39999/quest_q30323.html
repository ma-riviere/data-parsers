          <p>Ah, [%username]! Azphel must be watching over me, for you to come by just when I needed you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember how I was wondering why so many Daevas were being poisoned, when the venomous creatures in Silentera Canyon were so weak?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I was getting nowhere for a long time. Then I realized I was approaching the issue all wrong!</p>

          <p>I realized that there could another source of poison somewhere in Silentera Canyon. Yet no patrols reported anything of the kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Again I was stumped. But again I realized that I was looking at things the wrong way. Silentera Canyon itself contains other locations!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That was the breakthrough! It turns out that most of the poisoned Daevas were actually afflicted in Beshmundir Temple!</p>

          <p>Well, it was hard to tell at first--many of the poisoned Daevas were hallucinating, which is why we didn't realize about Beshmundir before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually, I discovered that the culprit is a gigantic Slime. But to fight its poison, I'll need the purest sample I can get.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With my past experience, analyzing it won't take long, but I'm not enough of a warrior to collect the sample myself. Could you...?</p>

          <p>Considering its virulent nature, I've called this slime [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_HugeSlimeNmd_55_Ah]. To create an antidote, I need its [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30223a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've narrowed down its location to the Vault of the Conquerors underneath Beshmundir Temple. Don't worry, you'll know it when you see it.</p>

          <p>This isn't just about a few poisoned Daevas, [%username]. This antidote could also treat many other poisons we can't yet touch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, with Plaguebearer's Core, it might even be possible to develop entirely novel poisons to use against the Elyos and Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you're skeptical--as I said, even I didn't think my research would be so useful--but I'm telling the truth. We need this.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, they won't recover completely--even through an Obelisk--without the antidote. That's what's so diabolical about this poison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm eager to see what the Plaguebearer's Core can tell us--even what it looks like!</p>

          <p>But I will definitely be able to create an antidote from it. Maybe two or three!</p>

          <p>After that, it definitely goes to Pandaemonium for more intensive study. I don't think you realize just how much knowledge you've brought me today.</p>
