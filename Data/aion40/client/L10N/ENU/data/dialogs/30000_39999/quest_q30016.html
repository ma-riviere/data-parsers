          <p>About your Siel's Supreme Sword, Daeva...I can restore its powers, but it won't be easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's taken on quite a bit of damage. What did you do to the poor thing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now...I can fix it, but it will require a little help from you. Will you help?</p>

          <p>This sword wasn't made like the standard swords you Daevas use. You can't just pound out the flaws on an anvil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need in order to fix your Siel's Supreme Sword is extremely rare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can find this material for me, I can surely restore your sword's true powers.</p>

          <p>Have you ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's a little before your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an ore birthed from the immense heat and energy produced when Lady Siel fought Tiamat before the Cataclysm. That's what Honeus says, anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can ask him yourself. If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] takes a shine to you, he'll give you the Noxallon Ingot...but he may ask you to run an errand for him first.</p>

          <p>Well, if you want to walk around with a dull and dinged-up Siel's Supreme Sword, it's your choice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the moment you run into a pack of angry Balaur and you pull that chunk of dead metal from your sheath, you'll wish you had taken me up on my offer.</p>

          <p>I'll be here for a few more hours.... Come back if you change your mind.</p>

          <p>Go find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus], run his errand for him, and bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01] so I can repair your damned sword! And remember--they need to be in your CUBE. Can't fix a sword you're holding, can I?</p>
