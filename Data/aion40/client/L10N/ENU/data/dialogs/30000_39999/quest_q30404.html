          <p>No! It's still not enough! I guess I should've known it wouldn't be so easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tell you, it's torture to know about all these cute spirits, yet not have any! But I WILL catch 'em all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid I've run out of ideas. But I'm sure there are others out there who can point me on the right path.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lumen]. If anyone knows how to capture new kinds of spirits, it's her.</p>

          <p>You? What do you... Glowing Spirits? How interesting! Current scholarship says they were all destroyed during the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you say some still exist? And they're... cute? What does that have to do with anything?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never mind. I think I can help, but I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_30404a]s. You can get them from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_LeafyManduriFi_57_An]s in Macori Hill.</p>

        <body>
          <p>I've consulted my fellows. They agree the Magic Cage I have in mind should work. They're also very excited at the prospect of taming Glowing Spirits once more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Macori's Lanterns are important to have, as they are of Balaurea, the same as the Glowing Spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish this all did not depend on a callow youth like you, but we have little choice. Did you have any luck finding some?</p>

          <p>Perfect! Apparently, even a bothersome Daeva like yourself can get something right occasionally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll get to work crafting a Magic Cage to suit your needs. Not even your rank amateurism can take away from this moment!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, imagine, reclaiming a Spirit thought lost to the ages! This is a very exciting time.</p>

          <p>Disappointed that the Quartz of Power didn't work, Sulos asked you to find out how to catch a Glowing Spirit alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to ask Lumen, a Reian High Sorcerer. He said he could make a Magic Cage to capture the spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Macori Hill and collected Macori's Lanterns needed to make it. He was excited at the prospect of seeing a Glowing Spirit.</p>
