          <p>Did I hear that you're going to Rentus Base? It's just... I made it out, but I didn't want to escape! Oreitia dragged me bodily along with her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My shield mate, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rodelion], was off-shift and asleep in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDYun_SZ_3]. He'd have been caught unawares when the attack came.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been friends and legionmates for so long. He's saved my life countless times. I can't abandon him like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go and look for him?</p>

          <p>Still, I know you Asmodians can be counted on. And Lition sent you? Siel bless his stubbornness.</p>

          <p>Give me a moment, and I'll retreat. Which way to the portal?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>He had high praise for your efforts. He's resting now, but he wanted me to thank you again on his behalf.</p>

          <p>For Rodelion and me, it's quite something. Many comrades are still missing, but I now feel like I had some impact on the situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You Asmodians have proven yourselves staunch allies of the Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This reward is paltry compared to my gratitude, but please,  take it in the spirit in which it is intended.</p>
