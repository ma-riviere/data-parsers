          <p>I know you've helped me a lot so far, but I need to ask you one more favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't figure out how we might turn that Artifact of Protection you saw back to normal without facing the Protector.</p>

          <p>Obviously, we can't get anywhere near the Artifact without dealing with its Protector.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems simple, but apparently, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_ElementalkingE_Wi_55_Al] is not at all normal. Its behavior has been described as...insane.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be difficult enough to fight under normal circumstances, but you know how insanity can increase power. Knowing that, will you help us?</p>

          <p>If you go down to the Splintercore and touch [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAbRe_Core_Artifact], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_ElementalkingE_Wi_55_Al] will appear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't turn back now. We've sacrificed a lot to claim the Divine Fortress and make it this far. The Artifact is in reach; we must grasp it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>if you manage it, and the Artifact of Protection returns to normal, make sure it works and report to Governor Votan. If we can't use it...well, I hope we can.</p>
