          <p>I'm glad you're here. I was approached recently by a Reian Elder. He had a request--but he wouldn't tell me what it was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I know it's odd. I got the impression he's somehow acting outside of normal channels, whatever that means for a Reian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This Reian, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raues], insisted on someone trustworthy and discreet. Given your previous dealings with their kind, you were an obvious choice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you should accept the request, if only to find out what demands such secrecy.</p>

          <p>Arilayuma, good Elyos. Oh, I'm sorry, did I say that wrong? Pardon this old man's rudeness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have heard much about you from my people, even the other elders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping you'd be the one to come help me.</p>

          <p>She might be harmed if too much became known now... but I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm glad you've come, [%username].</p>
