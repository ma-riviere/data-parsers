          <p>Perhaps it's time to swallow my pride. After all, it's Dirvisia whose life is at stake here.</p>

          <p>My beloved wife. There's nothing I wouldn't do to free her, even if it means groveling to Telemachus.</p>

          <p>You're right, there is. And maybe I owe you a better explanation if I'm going to send you traipsing all the way back to Eltnen.</p>

          <p>The Brigade General and I go back quite a ways. Used to be friends, believe it or not. Most men, they'd start telling you right here how it was a woman who came between us. Well, that's true, I guess, but I can't blame Dirvisia for following her heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if her heart led her to choose me over him...I can hardly be blamed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I need that Stone of Restoration, and if it helps my case with Telemachus to eat a little humble pie.... You'll take care of that for me, won't you?</p>
