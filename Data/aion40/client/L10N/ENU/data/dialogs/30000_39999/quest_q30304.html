          <p>It's imperative that we discover if we did, indeed, make a mistake. What was Isbariya warning against? What was the enemy trying to do with the ritual?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most importantly, we need to know what kind of impact this might have on us. Only then will we be able to prepare against any coming threat.</p>

          <p>I haven't read a single report about a ritual in Beshmundir Temple, from anywhere. It was a carefully guarded secret, and discovering its true nature will be quite difficult, I fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need the advice of an expert before we can decide our next move. Will you help?</p>

          <p>I believe [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Herka] may be able to help us. Explain everything that has taken place, including everything you know about Beshmundir Temple, and ask where we might go next to find more information.</p>
