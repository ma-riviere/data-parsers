          <p>Reian Elder [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garthenion] has asked me to send a Daeva to him. He claims it some sort of emergency.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know we're all very busy, but could you humor him? If it does turn out to be something important, you'll be the best one for the task.</p>

          <p>Skafir finally sent one. Quicker than I expected too.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>[%userclass], this is an urgent situation. I discovered illegal [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30704e]s scattered all around. These things are extremely dangerous, and we must get them removed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First though, we need to shut down the source: a shugo named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4b_10] seems to be the best bet. Find her, and get these things off the market!</p>

          <p>Was just selling them for a friend. Shulack named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Shulack_LF4a_8] gave to me, said we would split profit. Good money, nyerk, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Don't get me wrong, though, I'm just another middleman, er, middle-Shulack here. A Shulack scientist named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_ShulackScientist_60_Ae] got the fragments for me. If you don't any more fragments on the market, talk to him.</p>        
      	  <p> </p>
          <p>He works at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1]. He's probably so engrossed in his work, he'll never realize you're coming.</p>
