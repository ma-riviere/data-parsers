        	<p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>You know all too well that we are at war. In Elysea, Asmodae and the Abyss, unfeeling battles rage at fever-pitch. As a token of gratitude to the Daevas giving their lives both here and far away, the Alabaster Order would like to provide potions and Secret Remedies for the injured.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need your help to move forward with this plan! Please gather [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35034], the base for potions and Secret Remedies, and bring it to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>

          <p>Ah well. This Nepeta you've gathered will be useful for treating the injured. The Order will reward your devotion with Progress Tokens.</p>
