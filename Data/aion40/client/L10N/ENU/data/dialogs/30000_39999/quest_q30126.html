          <p>Not so easy to restore Siel's Supreme Orb. Like trying to put cracked egg back together after eating pieces of shell. That remind me of my last omelette.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Orb quite damaged, but if Daeva want it fixed, Tataka will help fix.</p>

          <p>Tataka happy to help. Mostly Tataka more interested in cooking, but Orb remind Tataka of food so it more analogous. Wonder if orb taste good...hmmm.... Let Kobold lick? No? Okay....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Restoration of orb requires Noxallon Ingot. Come from battle long ago with Lady Siel and Dragon Lord Tiamat, lots of heat and energy. Noxallon formed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very hard to find, very rare. You still want look for it?</p>

          <p>Only few [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01_dark]s left around that Tataka know of. Reian Tribe have most of them. Tribe elder Aglauros probably keeps them. Maybe ask him?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aglauros] probably have some errand to do first. Reians always ask favor. Not like Kobold, always friendly, willing to help. Tataka like Daeva. Tataka especially like Human....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like Human in good way, Tataka mean. Not like Human taste! Pthew! No way. Tataka is reformed Kobold.</p>

          <p>You make Tataka sad! Tataka not usually interested in this sort of thing. Now Tataka interested and Daeva not care? Very sad.</p>

          <p>No way, Tataka cannot fix orb without Noxallon Ingot. That like asking Tataka to cook without fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01_dark] to fix Siel's Supreme Orb. And put Orb and Ingot in Cube. Otherwise, no repair.</p>

          <p>Tataka at last have everything he need. But have option for Daeva. Can either fix orb up, or can grind up orb and ingor to use as flavor in new recipe. Noxallon Orb Stew. What think? Could be good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tataka didn't think so either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This not take long. Just need to heat ingot in forge...apply melted Noxallon to orb...and...there. Tataka finished. Orb good as new. Stronger, better. Probably tastier.</p>
