          <p>Lania may not be concerned about [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDUnderpassRe_SZ], but I still am. "Oh, it's just a few rogue Laksyaka Legion troops with access to a cache of stolen Balaur weapons. What could possibly go wrong?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And somehow this is supposed to make me feel better? I know that Lania is under a lot of pressure, so let's just leave her out of this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about you head into The Hexway yourself and kill all of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30062all] that you find in there?</p>

          <p>A safe return! Good. I was a bit worried that these Drakan might be stronger than the usual lot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It looks like you're okay though, so tell me what happened?</p>

          <p>Yes, of course. You certainly lived up to your reputation on this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I can report to Lania that she won't have to worry about the The Hexway anymore. I'm not sure how she'll view my taking initiative on this one, but she won't be able to argue with the results.</p>
