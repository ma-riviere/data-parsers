          <p>I can see that your skills have improved since last we spoke, [%username]. Is your Noble Siel's Supreme Sword still serving you well?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you've outgrown it by now.... Perhaps it's time to enhance it into Siel's Dominant Sword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With a little bit of effort and luck, I can take care of that for you.</p>

          <p>Ohhh, nothing you're not used to, Daeva. So, how about it? Care to enhance your Noble Siel's Supreme Sword?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to find a few things for me before I can begin, and you must also do the basic refining yourself...but that's pretty simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interested?</p>

        <body>
          <p>I mentioned a few things that I would need first--Vorpal Essence, a Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has it. And while you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>I'd like to work on several weapons for you at once, but it gets too confusing for me. I forget what ingredient goes where, how much to add...far too confusing.</p>
