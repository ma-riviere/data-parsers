          <p>I assume Pilomenes explained the basics to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither of us is sure whether it's the Balaur or their followers who are responsible, but there seems to be a way of opening up a new Stigma slot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Stigma Master, I couldn't help but be intrigued. But the document tells some of how the ceremony is conducted.... Nothing else.</p>

          <p>Indeed. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pilomenes] is the only Daeva who can shed some light on the ceremony. After all, he's read the entire document repeatedly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At the very least, he'll know where to start looking. Would you talk to him and find out where we should begin?</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]! Odd that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pilomenes] sent you to me without this information, but we'll play it his way for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See if you can bring back any materials we may need, too. If we can get this to work, I'll open a new Stigma slot for you as payment for helping.</p>

          <p>It just boggles the mind. If you see Pilomenes, tell him thanks for sending me the only Daeva in Sanctum who doesn't give two shards about Stigma slots.</p>

          <p>Faithful Respondent Utra! He's connected to much of what's in the Ancient Dragonbound Document, including this stigma ceremony! </p>

          <p>Given time, I should be able to reconstruct the ritual itself, but we still need to find the necessary components. Utra will tell us that part.</p>
