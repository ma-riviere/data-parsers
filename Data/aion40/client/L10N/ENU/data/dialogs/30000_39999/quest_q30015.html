          <p>Hold on just a moment there, [%username]! That sword you're carrying...that looks like Siel's Supreme Sword to me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must be one strong [%userclass] to wield something like that...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And one lucky Daeva to even possess one of those.</p>

          <p>It's a real shame, though...having a nice weapon like that all damaged and scuffed up. Real shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, I've seen Siel's Supreme Swords before...just none so smashed up as yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet if you had that restored, it would slice through just about anything. If only you had it restored...if only. I just happen to know a Reian that could fix it up real nice for you....</p>

          <p>You've made the right decision, [%username]. A weapon that can't unleash its full might is like a horse running on three legs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I said, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary that can work wonders on a sword of that caliber. Pure wonder.</p>

          <p>His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios] and he's got the smith touch.</p>

          <p>So you're saying that you're such a skilled [%userclass] that you can get by with a dulled, damaged sword? In this neck of the woods?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard rumors of your skills but not of your arrogance, [%username]. I'm not going to force you to go or anything, I'm just saying is all....</p>

          <p>This here is a relic, Daeva. An antique. They sure don't make them like this anymore. Just leave it to me, Daeva. I'll get it fixed up in no time.</p>
