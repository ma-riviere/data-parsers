          <p>All right, [%username], I think I figured out why I keep on...missing success. Not failing, mind you! Success is simply eluding me at the moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm changing direction. Rather than birth a new Spirit, I will try to summon an existing Spirit...a Fire Spirit. Like the little spurt of flame we saw earlier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Set the bar a little lower for now, you know. Grease up the works a bit first.</p>

          <p>I know this will work, [%username]. I assure you that once we get the proper incantation material, you will see dozens of Fire Spirits popping out all over the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what I need now are the head feathers of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Condor_Dr_53_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fourth time's a charm, right? Can you help me out again?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. I take back what I said earlier about the...about the...well, I take it all back. Really.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30231a]s. You can pluck them from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Condor_Dr_53_An]s at the Inggison Outpost.</p>

          <p>Everything is going to work out this time, I know it. I have a sense for these types of things.</p>
