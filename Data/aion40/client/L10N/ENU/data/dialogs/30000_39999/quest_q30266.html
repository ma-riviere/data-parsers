          <p>Pazuzu's Sanctuary is not the major holdup, like I first thought. It's [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_SZ_C] that's the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every one of my investigators report that an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Agrint_Kn_55_Ah] is protecting the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to these same reports, there's only one of them. I can't see why one blasted creature could hold up an entire operation! Could you dismantle this impasse for me?</p>

          <p>Like I said, the Enos Watcher is protecting the Storm Cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can get rid of him, my investigators can then advance into Kaluva's Nest. You'll probably have to fight him multiple times to get results, though.</p>
