          <p>What?! Where...where did you find this, [%username]? I haven't seen this since...my goodness, since the Cataclysm! This was my polearm, when I was about your age.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was a soldier back then, much like you. Our enemies knew me as Akarios, and they feared me greatly. But when I retired and left my quarreling days in the past, I also retired my name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I moved here to sleepy Poeta, and I defended these villagers from any harm. They named the village Akarios to thank me...haven't left since. But I never thought I'd see this again! Thank you, my friend.</p>
