          <p>Good [%username], I hate to ask when you have already done so much for me, but... when you rescued Rodelion, did you see anyone else nearby?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? Shards! I'd hoped they'd stuck together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a youth named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Paios] with combat skills quite advanced for one who's been training for only a few years. He was part of Rodelion's patrol the night the Balaur attacked, so I'd hoped you'd find them both at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Losing such talent would be tragic. Could you return to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun] and search for Paios near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDYun_SZ_3]? With our relatively small numbers, we cannot afford to lose such an adept warrior.</p>
