          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I saw that spellbook in your hands as you approached. I recognize its cover...that leather crowning...but I'm not sure from where.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sweet Lady of Light, is this the Siel's Supreme Spellbook? It is! You have to be one skilled [%userclass] to even know how to open it...let alone use it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, this spellbook is rarer than an honest Asmodian...how did you get it?</p>

          <p>It's a real shame it's all tattered, though. The cover is deteriorated...pages slipping out. It's a damn antique, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Siel's Supreme Spellbook is rumored to be able to start floods, cause plagues, strike down entire legions! But in this condition, I bet this book couldn't even put a child to sleep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just so happen to know a good Reian that can get that weapon as right as rain for you...on the cheap, too. Doesn't deal with Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors.</p>

          <p>I knew you'd agree, [%username]. After all, a spellbook that can't unleash its full potential is like a river dammed up by rocks. All that force...nowhere to go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary...goes by the name [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios]. He'll get that spellbook of yours back in pristine condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very peculiar process for repairing a spellbook, but don't be alarmed. That which is forged by magic is sometimes better repaired by brawn.</p>

          <p>This is no ordinary spellbook, [%username]! This is a Reian spellbook...assembled before you were even a twinkle in the ale that your brought your parents together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reian spells are unlike Elyos spells, my friend. In that spellbook are the words of the sun, the symbols of the sand, and the power of an entire culture...if it were in good condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know what your spellbook is right now? It's a child's book of scribbles. Just listen to your elder and get it repaired!</p>

          <p>You...you have Siel's Supreme Spellbook? What are you doing with this, Daeva? This book is the essence of pure power! Too powerful for a simple [%userclass] from Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This was the spellbook of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! Its power helped my people defeat countless armies....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now it's in tatters. I'm surprised it doesn't fall apart in your hands. Let me take a look at it...see what I can do.</p>
