          <p>I've figured out why I wasn't able to summon the Tree Spirit last time--the Gray Twigs you brought me were old, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Spirit wasn't able to channel through it. Otherwise, it would have worked. I gave you one simple task, and you managed to mess it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I now need a different material...something a bit stronger than twigs.</p>

          <p>Well, it's not really an additional favor, [%username]. It's still part of the original favor.</p>

          <p>I'm trying a different route this time. Summoning a Spirit requires an incredibly strong life force, so I'll need a material that will infuse the Spirit with a breath of life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30229a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B2_Centipede_53_An]s. They're in Undirborg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're pretty tough creatures, but I'm sure a [%userclass] of your caliber has dealt with worms before.</p>

          <p>Seriously, [%username]? You singlehandedly ruin my first attempt at summoning a Spirit by bringing me dead twigs.</p>

          <p>And now you won't even do the right thing by bringing me the right materials for my second attempt?</p>

          <p>Go on, kill Vilethorn Laupedes and Burrowing Laupedes and bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30229a]s. You know how important this is to me!</p>

          <p>Finally, everything has fallen into place. Stand back now, Daeva, I'm going to summon the Spirit! Do not stare it in the eyes when it appears.... I've been told that may frighten it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(She pulverizes the Hard Shells, sprinkles the powder around, and chants a spell with her eyes closed.)</p>

          <p>Why is nothing happening? I couldn't possibly have failed twice...because I don't fail! I never fail! Where is this blasted Spirit? I'll kill it if I see it!</p>
