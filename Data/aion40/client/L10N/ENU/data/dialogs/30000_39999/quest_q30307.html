          <p>We are fortunate indeed! The document describes a Balaur soul summoning in great detail!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this ritual, we could conjure the soul of an ancient Balaur, and it would be compelled to answer questions truthfully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is definitely the key to solving the mystery of "Stormwing."</p>

          <p>Most of it is chanting and basic rune drawing, but it does require a special Perfumed Oil to cleanse the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, the document describes the recipe for this oil as well.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30307a] needed to make the oil can be gathered from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Mudthorn_DR_54_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Foam_DR_55_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Slime_DR_55_An]s in Viscum Swamp.</p>
