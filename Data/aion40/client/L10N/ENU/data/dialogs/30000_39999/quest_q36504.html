          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_Lupyllini_52_n]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: The destruction of hunting traps and the annoyance of townsfolk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: This avian creature has caused significant property damage by destroying Guardian hunting traps. Lightningbeak Pabu is quite intelligent and more dangerous than he appears. Last known whereabouts: Wildheart Grove -- a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LF4_FOBJ_Q36504] has been set up there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyone who eradicates Lightningbeak Pabu will be rewarded generously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>As a Fortuneer, we take on just about any quest set before us.</p>

          <p>It doesn't matter if the mark is an animal, an enemy or even a Daeva--as long as it bleeds or pays in Kinah!</p>

          <p>Fortuneers do not enquire, we quell! Right, [%username]? Ha ha ha. Did you take care of Lightningbeak Pabu?</p>

          <p>So Lightningbeak Pabu trapped itself in the same traps it was trying to destroy? That is poetic, to say the least. Like an Asmodian falling into darkness. Like a...Shugo selling itself a broken sword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pretty good, yes? I fancy myself quite the poet, [%username]. But don't voice that too loudly or I'll have your hide. Here, take your reward and be gone with you.</p>
