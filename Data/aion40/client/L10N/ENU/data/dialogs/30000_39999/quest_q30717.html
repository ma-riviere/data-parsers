          <p>I know you spend most of your time on the battlefield nowadays, which is exactly why [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ancanus] has called for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems like you're in line for a hearty pat on the back. If you're interested in being thanked for all your hard work, that is.</p>

          <p>We've all heard about your work at Tiamat Stronghold! Outstanding accomplishments, if I may say so myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping you'd accept my offer to come here for a while, and indulge in some well deserved rest and relaxation. A Daeva cannot run on war alone, you know.</p>

          <p>Enjoy your time with us, my friend. There are always wars to be fought, but there are always drinks to be drunk and stories to be told, too. Some balance will serve you well, I think.</p>
