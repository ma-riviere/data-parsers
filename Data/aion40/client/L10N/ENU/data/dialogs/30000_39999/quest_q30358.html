          <p>With your help, I'm sure I can complete Laize's Panoply! I plan to work on the Pauldrons next, I think. Then maybe people won't look down upon me anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine, a homeless craftsman able to complete something that even so-called masters can't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There will never be a warrior as good as Rosarea, and soon there will never be a craftsman as good as me!</p>

          <p>Speaking of attitude...did you know that Rosarea was said to have a bad personality? It's true. She was bold and straightforward, but also quite hot-tempered and aggressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When her men did not follow her orders correctly, she screamed and raged so loudly that several were scared to death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no matter what, she believed in those she trusted until they succeeded. We must never give up, even in hardship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of which...will you stick with me through this task?</p>

          <p>I'll need plenty of Aether energy to finish the pauldrons. Take this marble and fill it with Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the Abyssal Splinter, there are plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_SilikaCannon_Ra_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Millipede_Sc_55_An]s worth killing--they're full of Aether they don't need!</p>

          <p>In the meantime, I'll work on Laize's Pauldrons some more. They'll be yours when they're fully infused.</p>

          <p>Rosarea was always confident, no matter who she dealt with--even with her superiors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When she thought her orders were fair, she wholeheartedly followed them. When she didn't, she wouldn't hesitate for a second to disobey them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think that's part of the reason she became such a legendary warrior. But I think you know something of that yourself, no?</p>

          <p>This should be just enough Aether to finish off the Pauldrons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I can't be certain; who knows. Aether is a tricky substance, especially when combined with metal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to try combining it right now. If it's enough, then the Pauldrons are yours. Wear them with as much pride as I had making them!</p>
