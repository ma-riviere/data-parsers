          <p>I've heard a lot about you, [%username]. Didn't you know? Your heroics in battle are quite legendary around these parts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you've heard of us? We are the Fortuneers, and we perform the perilous tasks that others can't seem to do...or don't want to do. We are a small crew, but our legion is growing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Simply put, we are an organization of fortune hunters who get paid well for collecting bounties. Most of us were soldiers at one time, but we tired of fighting someone else's battles. Now we fight for ourselves.</p>

          <p>We take on various jobs, you see. Sometimes we're hired to assassinate the most vicious killers Elysea has ever seen. Sometimes we apprehend runaway prisoners. And sometimes, during slow days, we hunt down lost treasure and split the loot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose in a broad sense that we are contributing to the peace of Elysea. We do good deeds for our land, but we also get paid well for it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I can see you're interested. I can tell that adventure is what you crave, not complacency. I'm extending this offer to you to join our Fortuneers Legion. Think about it.</p>
