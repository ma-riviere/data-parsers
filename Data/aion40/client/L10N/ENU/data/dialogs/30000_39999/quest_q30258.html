          <p>Laize's Panoply is a legendary set of armor, true, but I want to disabuse you of the notion that it might hold some magical method of making its wearer perfect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>True, Rosarea was an admirable warrior, but stories differ about her personality.</p>

          <p>Focused, straightforward, bold. Those are just a knife-edge away from aggressive, hot-tempered, and obsessive. She'd berate her Legionaries and her trusted companions every time they failed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that could just be that she didn't understand failure, being such a great warrior herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, enough history. Let's think of the here-and-now. Will you help me complete Laize's Pauldrons, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I think you remember my lovely Aether Marble, don't you. Such an ingenious invention, isn't it? And all mine! I created it esp.... Oh, you don't care.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure you'll gather enough energy from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_SilikaCannon_Ra_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Millipede_Sc_55_An]s.</p>

          <p>Didn't I tell you Rosarea was bold? Not just in the field either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even with her superiors, her confidence led the day. When she thought their orders were fair, she wholeheartedly followed them. But when she didn't, she wouldn't think twice about disobeying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, I think her personality contributed to her focus on skill, and skill made her a legendary warrior.</p>

          <p>They're plenty strong...but are they strong enough? If they are, I'll be happy to give them to you. If not, I'll need more Aether energy....</p>
