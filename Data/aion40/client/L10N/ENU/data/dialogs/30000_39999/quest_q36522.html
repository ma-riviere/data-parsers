          <p>Our reports say that Hikiron Farm has become a breeding ground for illegal Drana production and distribution, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those Drana huffers are turning the place to wet shards...but it's good business for us.</p>

          <p>Look for a huge statue that emits a strange light. Around there you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_LizardFi_52_An]. He patrols the area, making sure no one messes with his growing devices.</p>
