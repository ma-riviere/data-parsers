          <p>You say this is a Drakan document? I can't read it. If this is Balaur, it's encoded in some way. Or some dialect I'm not familiar with.</p>

          <p>Hmmmm.... I hate to say it, but why don't you ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aglauros]? He's been in Gelkmaros for a very long time. If anyone can read this, it's probably a Reian like him.</p>
