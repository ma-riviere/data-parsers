          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Elyos fighters move into Balaurea, so too does the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand. Our main purpose is to spread Elyos grace throughout the region. Currently, we are undertaking a project to build Holy Grounds within Inggison, and hope to move into Gelkmaros next.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Lords will not be forgotten, not while the Alabaster Order can remember. We call upon you--and all members of the Alabaster Order--to find [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35047_01]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35047_02]s, materials for building temples and Holy Grounds. Bring these to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>
