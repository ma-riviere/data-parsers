          <p>What is that glowing object I see in your satchel? Is that...is that Rundilima's Orb?</p>

          <p>Oh, I must have been mistaken, [%username]! That isn't Rundilima's Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we don't take care of him soon, I fear the Balaur will attack another fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ruffle your wings, Fortuneer, and get a move on! Listen, a witness came forward and said he saw Summoner Rundilima in Angrief Ruins. The witness is a Shulack, so you can't trust his word too much, but he said he also saw the orb. Get to it!</p>

          <p>So this is Rundilima's Orb? It's quite heavy, isn't it? They say it has the power to summon anything I want.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Should I try it? What should I wish for? Should I wish for a lake full of ale? My own village of Elyos women? Ahh, I'm pulling your wings, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here is your well deserved reward. Leave me now, I have much to ponder.</p>
