          <p> </p>
      	  <p>I'm not especially familiar with [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF1]. I think [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Litzof] at Rancora Fortress is more of an expert than I. He used to work at Beluslan Fortress, and will know how to deal with this information.</p>

          <p>Dark Poeta? Of course I know about it. There's no one who spent time at Beluslan Fortress who doesn't know about what happened in Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>What? These are obviously connected to the incident that causes Dark Poeta. Anuhart is the future Brigade General of Dark Poeta, and these are the orders promoting him and sending him there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to report this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asraphis] immediately! We might be able to change history.</p>

          <p>Anuhart is an exceptional leader. In Dark Poeta he nearly defeated the forces arrayed against him.</p>

          <p>Asraphis is going to chew me out for wasting time instead of just telling you to do that immediately, but I'm glad your action prevented a huge mistake on my part.</p>
