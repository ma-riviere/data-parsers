          <p>It is my life's goal to restore Laize's Panoply. Nothing else matters to me. I gave everything up for this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the middle of factional disputes, I didn't make it to the rank of master--because I was distracted by thoughts of this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I restore Laize's Panoply, people will see that I am the master of masters, formal titles be damned!</p>

          <p>Making Laize's Gaiters will be a big challenge. The design is as sophisticated and detailed as anything I have ever seen, but I can succeed if I try hard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is performance. Since the original ones were made before the Cataclysm, they were filled with amazingly strong Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I can infuse strong Aether energy into my Gaiters with your help, though. Are you with me, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Right now, the Abyssal Splinter is still the best place to collect strong Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Inside, there are plenty of Aion's fragments and a lot of creatures created by the power of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this crystal fragment with you, and fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Flyingworm_El_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Cyclops_Fi_55_Ah]s. The Aether energy they release will be stored in this fragment.</p>

          <p>Laize's Gaiters were beautiful enough to be a work of art, but I don't think Daevas back then appreciated their beauty. After all, they were almost always stained with the blood of the Balaur!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rosarea fought more battles than any other Daeva, anytime and anywhere. She always led her brigade on the front lines of war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some joked that she was a tiny little Petralith who just looked like a Daeva. No food, no rest.</p>

          <p>Ah, you've brought back the crystal fragment full of Aether. I think this might be enough to complete Laize's Gaiters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's hard to say. The Gaiters will "tell" me when they're complete, and not a moment before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you know what? The minute they're done, they're yours. Just tell everyone who made them. Heck, they may be yours right now.... Let's give it a try....</p>
