          <p>Ohhh, this is going to be amazing, [%username]. I've never restored a document as old as this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seeing as how this is written on mummified flesh, like I first thought, I will need to use several solvents to clean it...without disintegrating it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have this, this, this, and a little of that left, but...I'm missing one ingredient. It's a liquid that renews ancient inks.</p>

          <p>Oh, that would be great, [%username]. You see, the Balaur always wrote in ink derived from blood and...oh, you don't care.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The solvent that I need comes from [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30210b]. The sulfer found near craters is the most potent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you bring some back for me?</p>

          <p>Since this document originated from Inggison materials, I believe [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30210b]s found in Inggison creatures will be the most effective.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Angrief Wastes and get Sulfur Crystals from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Cyclops_Acid_55_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Vampire_Acid_55_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Agrint_Acid_55_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think with solvent made from their crystals, the document's faded text should darken up enough to read it.</p>
