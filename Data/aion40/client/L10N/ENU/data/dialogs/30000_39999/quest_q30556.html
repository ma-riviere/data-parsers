          <p>I'm afraid I didn't know Merops personally. But I understand very few did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He certainly seems to be quite depressed, seemingly because of Kerran. I don't recognize the name, however. To solve this mystery, we need the missing text.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun] likely have have the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30506A] by now, so it's vital that you find it.</p>

          <p>Merops was a very private individual. I don't even know if he had any family.</p>

          <p>Yes, this is it! Now to... oh. His entire family. It's hard to contemplate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No wonder his thoughts turned to despair. Such sacrifice is more than we can ask of any individual.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I'd known about Merops's children but not about the depths of his despair. He kept his emotions hidden well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And he doesn't specify how much he told the Balaur. We'll have to find that out ourselves somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate not knowing more, but at least we have a better idea of our circumstances. This is for your hard work on our behalf.</p>

          <p>You found the other half of the scroll, which revealed very personal motives. Still, it only hinted at what secrets he gave away.</p>
