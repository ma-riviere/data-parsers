          <p>It's worse than that, though. We managed to capture a Drakan and Draconute on their way to visit the Kaidan Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not talking, of course, but they had documents that made it pretty sharding obvious that the Krall wanted to give 'em some kind of tribute.</p>

          <p>We want that tribute. We need that tribute. That'll show those sharding Krall trolls.</p>
