          <p>I'm getting closer to finishing my work. That famous, violet panoply worn by Rosarea.</p>

          <p>And today I start the pants. Laize's Gaiters will be a challenge, I think. Their outer part is complex, but if I keep trying, I should be able to replicate it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is performance. Since the original gaiters were made before the Cataclysm, they have amazingly strong Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you help me recreate that Aetheric quotient?</p>

          <p>This time, you'll be taking my Crystal Fragment with you into the Abyssal Splinter. It holds more Aetheric power than the old Aether Marble did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should be able to collect enough power from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Flyingworm_El_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Cyclops_Fi_55_Ah]s.</p>

          <p>No one had the chance to appreciate Laize's Gaiters as a work of art before. Back when Rosarea wore them, they were always stained with the blood of her enemies.</p>

          <p>I can feel the magnitude of the Aether energy in my hand. This is...did you feel this way too? How did you ever give up the fragment?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Laize's Gaiters are more important than mere power on its own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All right, then. I just put this here...and do this...and then we should have gaiters! If so, take them! If not, I have to have more Aether energy.</p>
