          <p>My fellow member of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our Chasing Eyes in Weeping Valley have disappeared. When this started, we simply reinstalled the devices, but the new ones vanished just like the originals did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since no other Chasing Eyes have gone missing, we looked into the area and believe that Grim Pucas are the problem. As long as the Pucas are there, reinstalling is meaningless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call upon you--and all of the Alabaster Order--to destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Bookie_Fairy_53_An]s and report to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021]. We must keep our eyes on suspicious passersby!</p>

          <p>It's because they love to collect shiny stuff. Aion only knows what they hope to do with it.</p>

          <p>Now that you've cleared out those Pucas, we can install our Chasing Eyes at Weeping Valley.</p>

          <p>Hopefully nothing else'll tear 'em down, right?</p>
