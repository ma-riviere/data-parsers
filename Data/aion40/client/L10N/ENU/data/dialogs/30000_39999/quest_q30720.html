          <p>Tiamat had this? Strange. Strange for the King of Blood to hold something so delicate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait! "Sabat's Song." Sabat was the Dragon famed for levelling the Rancora North Gate. It's nothing more than ruins, even today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. Would you mind leaving this with me? I want to study it...</p>
