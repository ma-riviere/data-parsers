          <p>I'm afraid I didn't know Merops very well. Perhaps if I had, all this could've been avoided.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So while these entries display a certain amount of stress, I couldn't tell you where it came from. It likely has to do with this Kerran he mentions, but I don't know who that is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDYun] likely have the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30506A] by now, and it's vital that you get it back, [%username].</p>

          <p>Merops was very private, very introverted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Having this kind of insight into his mind is rare. But in this case, it's vital.</p>

          <p>Yes, this is it! Now to... oh. I... I never knew he even had children, much less that all three died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot imagine his heartbreak. No wonder his thoughts turned to despair.</p>

          <p>Hmm. I'd known about Merops's children but not about the depths of his despair. He kept his emotions hidden well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And he doesn't specify how much he told the Balaur. We'll have to find that out ourselves... somehow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's grim news, but at least we know it. My thanks to you.</p>

          <p>You found the other half of the scroll, which revealed very personal motives. Still, it only hinted at what secrets he gave away.</p>
