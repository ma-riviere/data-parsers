          <p>Mudthorns are highly dangerous critters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They originally lived in the Contaminated Swamp, but they kept spewing Sticky Body Sap, further contaminating the water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They spread rapidly so you must get rid of every single Mudthorn you come across. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your dedication has given the Beritra Zombie Area new life. The Green Hat Unit is always thankful for your hard work, [%username].</p>
