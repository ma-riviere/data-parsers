          <p>Your skills have improved incredibly since last we spoke, my Elyos friend. Is your Noble Siel's Supreme Greatsword still serving you well?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's time to upgrade your greatsword? Perhaps you are ready to carry Siel's Dominant Greatsword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will require a little bit of work from you, but I believe you can handle it.</p>

          <p>Ohhh, you can handle it, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to obtain a few items for me before I can begin, and you must also do the basic refining yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that shouldn't be too difficult for a [%userclass] of your caliber. Interested?</p>

        <body>
          <p>I mentioned a few things that I would need first--Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>Daeva, we have ourselves a little problem here. You already have a weapon being worked on!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to work on several weapons for you at once, but it gets too confusing for me. I forget what ingredient goes where, how much to add, which is which...far too confusing.</p>

          <p>Daeva, I know you are eager to upgrade your weapon, but the dawn only follows the night. You must accomplish each step in its own order. You cannot rush the process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] first.</p>
