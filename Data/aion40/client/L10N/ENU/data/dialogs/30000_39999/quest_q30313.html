          <p>I apologize for my outburst earlier, [%username]. It was unworthy of me as an Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I discovered other magical creatures that could provide the necessary power. In fact, the Balaur themselves took advantage of one of these species.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The undead energies of Acheron Drakes could be exactly what we need.</p>

          <p>Actually, it's exactly what we need. I'd stake my reputation on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's because I've discovered the existence of a particularly powerful Acheron Drake dwelling in the Forgotten Storeroom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With its energies, you can finally activate the Rift Orb and see Stormwing with your own eyes. Please take this final step with me.</p>

          <p>When you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_BonedrakeNmd_55_Ah], you can extract its Magical Essence. Once you have it, return to the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDCatacombs_BigOrb_Q30211].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use the Magical Essence and the Quartz Rod. The two will resonate on their own, providing the power the Rod needs to activate the Orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can then teleport to the place where Stormwing is imprisoned. If you decide to enter the portal right then and there--and you need not--I suggest bringing powerful and staunch allies with you.</p>
