          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your hard work protecting the realm, we are now able to concentrate on strengthening the Aetheric Field. But we can't do it without your help! Our fundraising activities haven't resulted in the amount of Aether we need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let all Alabaster Order members in Atreia cooperate. We call upon you to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35039_01] from a [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35039] for donation. The Aether can be turned in to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35014] for organized addition to the Aetheric Field. Your contribution will help keep all Elyos well-beings alive. For the sake of Sanctum and all Atreia!</p>
