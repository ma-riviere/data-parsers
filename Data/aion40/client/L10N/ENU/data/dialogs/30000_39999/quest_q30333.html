          <p>Clearly, all of the spirits that comprise Flarestorm should be freed from the Balaur and returned to the flow of Aether.</p>

          <p>Of course, you will require an Incinerator Key to reach Flarestorm. I can make a copy of the key using magic, but it will require your assistance, [%username].</p>

          <p>The key must be fused together from four elements, and so I will use the same materials I used to summon the local spirits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may recall, you can obtain [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30328a]s by defeating Thorny Cellatus and Young Cellatus, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30329a]s by defeating the Klaws at Twilight Drana Farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No doubt you also remember that the Krall at Vorgaltem Battlefield have the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30330a]s I need, and the Ancient Acheron Drakes will provide the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30331a]s.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry to hear that, [%username]. I suppose Flarestorm can wait a bit longer, as it has waited an eternity already, but please remember its terrible torment.</p>

          <p>I can appreciate that you are busy, [%username]. But please remember that Flarestorm has been imprisoned since before the Cataclysm. Thousands of individual Fire Spirits, contaminated for centuries.... We must free them all, as soon as we can.</p>
