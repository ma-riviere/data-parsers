          <p>Apparently there's a large orb in the Ritual Chamber where Isbariya the Resolute dwelled. You can use this orb to teleport to the Prison of Ice...where Stormwing is sealed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, it seems you need some type of special energy source to use the orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And this energy source is inside the Quartz Rod and...let's see...you can obtain it from a place called the Forgotten Storeroom.</p>

          <p>Nothing important is ever easy, [%username]. Hmmm...I don't understand where the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCatacombs_SZ_C] is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It says something about a hidden door just before the Hero's Vault, but I have no idea where this Hero's Vault is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Try to find this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30211a]. And while you're there, use the Quartz Rod to activate the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDCatacombs_BigOrb_Q30211], too.</p>

          <p>You should be able to get the Quartz Rod by killing something called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCatacombsN_ShadowStalker_55_Ah] in the Forgotten Storeroom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30211a] to the Ritual Chamber in the Temple of Eternity and activate the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDCatacombs_BigOrb_Q30211].</p>

          <p>You may come face to face with Stormwing somewhere in the process, so make sure your blades are sharp and your wits are even sharper!</p>
