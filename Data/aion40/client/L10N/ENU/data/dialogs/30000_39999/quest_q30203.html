          <p>I've considered our options and I believe we need some eyes on the ground to figure this out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Considering where the Dragonbound are heading, it's logical to conclude that their final destination is Silentera Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the most likely place in Silentera Canyon to find Protectors is at Beshmundir Temple.</p>

          <p>Last time I was there, the Temple Protectors tended to congregate in the deepest part of Beshmundir Temple. It won't be easy, but I know you will triumph.</p>
