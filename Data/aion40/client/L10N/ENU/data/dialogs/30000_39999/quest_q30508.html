          <p>We were separated during the retreat, I'd wager. We used an unstable Gate, and... well, only two of us made it back to Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please send [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vicios] my greetings in return. And tell him I haven't forgotten about the 200 Kinah he owes me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I plan to collect, even if I have to drag myself to Rentus Base and shake it out of him in person! Just because he went and died doesn't mean he can escape his debts.</p>

          <p>You're the Elyos I met earlier, aren't you? It's been so long, faces start to blur together.</p>

         <p>Hah, that Akarios! Tightfisted as always! Fine, then, let's see how he likes this!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Akarios was always softhearted when it came to animals. He used to have this mild-tempered Aukwi, good for nothing but making pretty eyes for affection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, he named that Aukwi Pernos. Yes, the great Akarios named himself after his childhood pet!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ha ha! Now that's a thought that'll have me chuckling 'til the end of time. Thanks for carrying his message to me.</p>

          <p>He also asked you to return his greetings to Paudav. You did so, and the soul was very grateful to be remembered still.</p>
