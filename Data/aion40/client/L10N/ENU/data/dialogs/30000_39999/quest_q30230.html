          <p>Hmmm...the only explanation for the two failed attempts is the materials I used.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried blaming you, which worked perfectly well for me the first time. But even I can't do it twice in a row. I must now blame the materials of this land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I am far too clever to let your ignorance and the shoddy materials of Balaurea keep me from succeeding. I will try even harder this time.</p>

          <p>I hear that quite a bit, [%username]. That's envy talking. And I will ignore it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To get back to my concerns now...I realized that I can't rely on just one material to do the trick. I'm going to see what happens when I beef it up a little.</p>

          <p>I know I ruffled your wings earlier, but can I ask for your help once again, [%username]? I knew we'll get it this time!</p>

          <p>So, here's my next project for you--Balaur Scales. I know this is the material that will do the trick.... I can feel it.</p>
          <p> </p>
