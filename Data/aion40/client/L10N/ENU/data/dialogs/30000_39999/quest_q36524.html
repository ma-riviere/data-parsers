          <p>I may not be a soldier anymore, but I remember how important it is to keep military secrets...a secret.</p>

          <p>Sanctum's up in arms about this one, [%username]. I'm glad you came through for the Fortuneers. We might even land ourselves some more military work after this.</p>

          <p>I fear those stolen weapons will still end up in the hands of the Reians. Damn savages!</p>

          <p>If they do wind up in their pink, little hands, who knows what kind of damage they could cause. We'll need to get those arms back...as soon as Sanctum issues a tasty bounty for them, that is!</p>
