          <p>I wish the other Daevas here at the fortress were a bit more cooperative and friendly. It seems like every time one of them speaks to me, they have a favor to ask.</p>

          <p>I am not surprised. Give me that report....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmmm..... You took this from a Dragonbound? Well, it wasn't written by one of them. My guess is it's written in ancient Balic--which I cannot read.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might try [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Athis] over there. He studies ancient history and knows more about the ancient Balaur. Or perhaps you should look up [%username]--a wise Daeva, if the rumors are true, and one I hope to meet someday.</p>

          <p>This is similar to the language spoken by the ancient Balaur, though it's not a perfect match. My guess is that it's just a code using ancient Balaur in place of key terms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without more time, I can't decipher the full text, but I can give you the gist of it now....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, this is...a report for a...sealer? Abjurer? I can't tell, but this talks about a material for some kind of ritual.... Drana would be my guess. It says they are sending only half.</p>
          <p> </p>
