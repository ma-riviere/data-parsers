          <p>I see it now...I see it so clearly. The souls of the Daevas are imprisoned in the Beshmundir Temple...in some subterranean river.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The spirit of a Daeva named Calike has shown me...shown me that an evil shaman has captured their souls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's using their agony and torment as some type of energy source.</p>

          <p>They were Daevas who fought against the Balaur...but now they're somehow trapped by this wicked shaman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must free their souls, [%username]. I am but a Daeva of the cloth...my faith is my weapon. And although my faith is strong, it is not strong enough to help them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They need a skilled [%userclass] to free them. For the sake of Siel, would you lend your wings to help them?</p>

          <p>Oh, faith and arms, [%username]! I hoped I could count on you. First, go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCatacombs_SZ_B3] under the Beshmundir Temple and meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Calike].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He will tell you how to free the souls of the Daevas. It won't be easy, but I will pray for you. I will pray for all the Seraphim Lords to protect you.</p>
