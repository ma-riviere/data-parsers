          <p>Your appearance doesn't do your reputation justice, [%username]. I've seen many Daevas like you come and go...shooting stars, nothing more. They shine bright then fade out quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they say you're one skilled Daeva! Maybe the most skilled [%userclass] in all of Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm asking you for your help.</p>

          <p>You're probably already aware of this, but Inggison has many problems. It's Balaur land, so problems come naturally to this place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My Hushblade Legion doesn't have the manpower to deal with all the problems here. That's why you and I are talking, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't care what you think about me, and I'm sure the feeling's mutual on your end. This is just business. You help us, I'll pay you. Interested?</p>

          <p>I figured as much, [%username]. The only way to a Daeva's conscience is through his coin purse. Honor has a price these days.</p>
