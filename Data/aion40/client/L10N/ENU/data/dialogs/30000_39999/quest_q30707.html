          <p>As useful as this book is, it was not ours to take, [%username]. It belongs to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bhasha], and it is our responsibility to make sure it is returned to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
					<p>If there is one thing we Elyos should have learned from the last year, it is that allies can come from the strangest of places. We have worked alongside the Asmodians, and perhaps we can work alongside the Balaur too, or at least some of the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the book to Vhasha, and tell him that his prophecies were correct. We could use an ally of his caliber on our side.</p>

          <p>You must have killed the Thieves, and recovered my book! And my prophecies all came true?! This is remarkable....</p>

          <p>Pernos told you that times were changing, and that allies have recently been found in the most unlikely places. He stated that it was regrettable that Vhasha had been imprisoned, and suggested you take him his book while telling him about the accuracy of his prophecies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vhasha was thrilled to learn that his prophecies were true, and was clearly happy to be reunited with his book.</p>
