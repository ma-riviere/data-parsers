          <p>Ah, [%username]? I hate to ask you this, but....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been chasing after these Glowing Spirits for quite a while. I think they've gotten to know me. They'd run at first sight of me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've decided that I like the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_ElementalLightM_60_Ah]s the best. They're cute AND proud-looking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you maybe just capture one in the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30407A]? Pleeeease?</p>

          <p>Bah, I can't seem to think of a good name for my Glowing Spirit! This'll definitely take a lot more thought.</p>

          <p>Oh, this was SO worth it. In fact, I think I'm going to catch some more! Maybe I can have a whole herd of adorableness!</p>
