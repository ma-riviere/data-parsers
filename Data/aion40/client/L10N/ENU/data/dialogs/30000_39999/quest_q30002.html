          <p>An empty home is no home at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now a previously abandoned Balaur site called the Udas Temple is home to an unknown group, but it's a home which works against us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their attempts to expand beyond the temple grounds have so far met with failure, but no failure is permanent for a determined being.</p>

          <p>It could be a reason as benign as having nowhere else to go, but I'd rather be sure of their good intentions. If, indeed, they are good.</p>

          <p>Only united can you stand their powers. For now, it's too dangerous to enter the temple alone. Outside the temple, however, our craven enemies of Undirborg hold clues. If you meet the brainwashed berserkers who worship the Balaur, you may find what we need.</p>

          <p>Good! There's just a few more. You also need to go after the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticRa_53_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticWi_53_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticEl_53_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticPr_53_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticCh_53_An]s.</p>
