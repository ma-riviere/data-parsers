          <p>I must admit that the Elemental Spirits native to Balaurea are proving rather...unimpressive. Shy, reclusive....</p>

          <p>If we are to achieve eternal fame then we must summon up something much larger.</p>

          <p>Just my thought. Wind is quite powerful, and no one can deny its presence. If we can summon a Hurrikane, then our place in history is assured.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>To summon a Hurrikane we need something associated with the element, such as [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30330a]s. Fresh ones will never do--we need something ancient, so the spirit itself will be ancient and immense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmmm...I have it! At Vorgaltem Battlefield there are Krall guarding the field. I have seen them wearing amulets made of Pteron Bone Pieces. No doubt these belonged to a massive creature from ancient times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Assault the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_KrallFi_DR_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_KrallSc_DR_55_An]s and bring me pieces of their amulets!</p>

          <p>That is no ordinary wind, my friend. That is an ancient Hurrikane! Surely you cannot deny its presence as it passes by?</p>
