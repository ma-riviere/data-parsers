          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your hard work, we are now able to spend our efforts on strengthening the Aetheric Field. But we can't do it without your help! Our fundraising activities haven't provided the amount of Aether we need to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now is the time for all Alabaster Order members in Atreia to cooperate. We call upon you to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35031_01]s for donation. The Aether Gems can be turned in to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007], who is organizing their addition to the Aetheric Field. Your contribution will help keep all Elyos well-beings alive. For the sake of Sanctum and all Atreia!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, as the Alabaster Order grows, we need more money and materials to support you agents in the field. Please bring [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35031_01]s as requested...and don't make me repeat myself again.</p>

          <p>Their fundraising ineffective, the Alabaster Order called for another kind of donation--acquiring Aether Gems to strengthen the Aetheric Field.</p>

          <p>When you brought Aether Gems to Aiskyholos in Heiron, he thanked you for your cooperation and said he would give you Progress Tokens in return.</p>
