          <p>[%username], your efforts against Stormwing have been most commendable. I would like to reward you accordingly, but first I need you to promise me something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you do that?</p>

          <p>Please keep Stormwing's location a secret for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is too dangerous to be allowed to get free, but I'm afraid that people who are more rash--or more desperate--might think it a good idea to unleash him against Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That must not be allowed to happen.</p>

          <p>This promise is for the good of Gelkmaros and all Asmodians. I would never ask you to do something questionable. And you've put forth so much effort for us lately that I would hesitate to ask more of you so soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, it's just a simple matter. I hope you reconsider.</p>

          <p>Good. Do not mention it to anyone, no matter how trusted. You never know who may be listening. An Elyos spy would never hesitate to use this against us.</p>
