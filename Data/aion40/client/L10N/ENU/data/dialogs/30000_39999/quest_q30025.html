          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I saw that orb in your hands as you were walking up. I recognize it...vaguely. It triggers my old memories...like a dream you only half remember.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sweet Wings of Ariel, is this Siel's Supreme Orb? It is! How did a [%userclass] like you come across this?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, this orb is rarer than a Fortuneer without an ale in his hand! How did you get it?</p>

          <p>It's a real shame it's all scuffed up and chipped. I can barely see inside of it. It's like a rainy day outside a window...dirt swirling in a pond.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Siel's Supreme Orb is rumored to have power the likes of which we Elyos have never seen! But in this condition, I doubt it could hold down paper on a windy afternoon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just so happen to know a dependable Reian that can get that orb as right as rain for you. Doesn't deal with Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors. Interested?</p>

          <p>I hoped you'd agree, [%username]. An orb in this condition is nothing more than a pretty rock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I was saying, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios] is his name. He'll get that orb of yours back in pristine condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has a very peculiar process for repairing something so fragile, but don't be alarmed.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>In this condition, not so much. This orb needs to be repaired...but you just can't seem to find the time? Is that right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you'll find the time when you're dead on the battlefield from having a lousy orb with limited powers!</p>

          <p>You...you have Siel's Supreme Orb? What are you doing with this, Daeva? This orb is far too powerful for a simple [%userclass] from Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This was the creation of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! This orb holds the power of an entire culture in its heart, Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you've let its light turn to shadows, its opacity become muddied. I will repair it, but not for you...for the legacy of my people.</p>
