          <p>I suppose the next step is in my hands now. I have to be honest, [%username].... It's been a long time since I've loved any woman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As much as I tried to reject her, there was something about her. My heart... Azphel knows I can't control my emotions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nep? I'll make amends to him, somehow. But Sinigalla is what's important right now.</p>

          <p>Even if I could leave Morheim for Balaurea, I don't know if I could face her right now. I wouldn't know what to say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if nothing else, a fellow Daeva is suffering, and may be in mortal peril. Could you free Sinigalla from her curse for me?</p>

          <p>I was told the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Underpass_DaStatue_Q30156] is located near the beginning of Silentera Canyon.</p>

          <p>It might be for the best that you refuse. I should send this remedy to Nep anyway.</p>

          <p>Please tell Nep to forget about me, that I wasn't worthy of his love. Tell him I've gone to find happiness, and that I want him to do the same.</p>
