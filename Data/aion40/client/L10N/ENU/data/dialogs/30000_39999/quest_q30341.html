          <p>Tataka heard rumor that Sealed Balaur in Beshmundir Temple has Vorpal Essence. Tataka know of someone who had Special Shulack Refiner, but hear he is captured by Nightshade Clan. Blessed Aurium Ingot will be hardest to find. Is rare mineral prized by Shulacks--not know more. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once Daeva finds three materials, take to Debilkarim's Forge then fuse together to make Essence of Siel. When Daeva has Essence of Siel, bring back to Tataka. </p>
