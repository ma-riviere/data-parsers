          <p>[%username]! You're the perfect Daeva for this job! Come over here for a minute, will you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Barono] is looking for a Daeva for some important missions. Something to do with a Unstable Abyssal Splinter, I hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, go to Latis Plaza at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_1] and talk to Barono to get the rest of the information.</p>

          <p>Crispin? Oh, it must be about that mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I'm looking for a Daeva to investigate the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_02_SZ_All] that formed at the Divine Fortress. Scouts have been coming back saying that the creatures inside are even more dangerous than the ones inside the regular Abyssal Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like you to take care of whatever's in there. Get some allies and head to [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Ab1_1011_TreasureGate_Li] when you're ready.</p>
