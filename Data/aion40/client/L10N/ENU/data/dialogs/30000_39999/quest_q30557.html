          <p>An Asmodian, here? I never expected to see one of you again. Not after my legion was ordered to retreat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to be an Elyos, you see, a member of the Storm Legion who first made contact with your kind. I somehow turned Reian while others of my comrades chose to hide--turning into these little beasts with long ears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Gerger_1] was always proud. Would you find my old legionmates, your broken and defeated victims, and convince them to finally go home?</p>

          <p>And we certainly don't know anything about a whole race of Elyos weaklings who let their comrades die horrible deaths.</p>

          <p>The soul of a Reian tribesman called Paudav appeared when you touched the incense burner on the Sparring Grounds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It turned out he was once an Elyos, and the Gergers in Altgard were some of his fellow Legionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Gemyu, one of said Gergers, but he heatedly denied everything.</p>
