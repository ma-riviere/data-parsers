          <p>I realize, Elyos, that it's improper to ask a favor of someone I just met, but I find myself in a very sticky situation here.</p>

          <p>I know you have your own problems, but my professional reputation as well as my business are now on the line....</p>

          <p>You see, [%username], I got a large order for my handcrafted pickaxes...quite a sum of Kinah, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took me weeks to make them...just finished last nightfall. Then, I wake up this morning, and everything is gone...all my pickaxes, gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The order is due tomorrow--some of your Brigade Generals ordered them. There's no way I can make that many again in one night. I can't afford to lose this sale or this client.</p>

          <p>That would be nice, but I'd need more time than you can possibly give me. I haven't had much business in awhile, and there are plenty of blacksmiths looking for work these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need is a message delivered to one of your people. He's always been kind to me, and he owes me a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's in the Undirborg Observation Post. His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sueros], and he's a centurion. Would you deliver the message to him for me? The guards won't let me through without the proper documents.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>When you find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sueros], ask if he has a reliable source for tools...pickaxes, preferably. As many as he can get.</p>

          <p>I'm hoping this might buy me a little time...until I can find the heartless savage that stole my order.</p>

          <p>Hmm...these Reians are a strange bunch of characters, aren't they?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd put my Kinah on the culprit being one of his own kind--some Reians don't like to see their countrymen working with us Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I've gotten orders to try and foster better relationships with these Reians...that's why I urged the general to place the order with Gefeios in the first place. Let me see what I can do.</p>
