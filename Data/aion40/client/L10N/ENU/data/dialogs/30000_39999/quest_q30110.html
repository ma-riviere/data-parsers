          <p>I assume you've heard of the Dragonbound? I've heard that blasted name too often lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've treated many septic wounds caused by them--too many, in fact, for normal weaponry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've found that they are coating their blades and arrowheads with poison.</p>

          <p>Of course. Right now, I can only treat symptoms--a long and painful road to recovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To do that, I need a sample of the poison in its purest form, before it goes to work in the body.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard you take such tasks for the good of fellow Daevas and Asmodae...?</p>

          <p>I'm afraid I only have secondhand accounts from the Daevas I've treated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But some told me that they saw the Dragonbound with a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_PoisonBottle_Q30010] before they were attacked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those are what I need. They're probably scattered throughout Udas Temple for the Dragonboud to use. Bring them back for me.</p>

          <p>I know it must be difficult obtaining the poison without becoming its victim, but I really do need it in its original state. It's the best bet I have of finding an antidote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_PoisonBottle_Q30010]s are probably either well-guarded or well-hidden, but please do your best to get them.</p>

          <p>Hmm, the bottles are smaller than I expected they'd be. It's either more potent or more concentrated than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at last, I can start creating an antidote. It'll also tell me a lot about how the Dragonbound make all their poisons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This was no mere fetch errand--you've actually advanced the Asmodian cause significantly. Good job.</p>
