          <p>It's no wonder our people get along so well with the Reians--we have both endured so much, yet remained strong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've heard that the Elyos are starting to ally with Reians in Inggison. Elyos! What can they possibly have in common with our worthy allies?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've helped the Reians in the past, so I want you to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q30511_ALL] members and bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30511A]s back, as a sign of very Asmodian goodwill.</p>

          <p>Very nice work, [%username]. These will go right to the Reian elders as proof of our commitment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few more missions like this, and we might even be able to sway the Reians in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been authorized by Pandaemonium to reward Daevas who undertake tasks such as this. Here's your share.</p>

          <p>Anarin thought that if Asmodians helped out at Rentus Base, the Reian Tribe would start to trust you more than they do the rotten Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As requested, you defeated Vasharti Legionaries and collected their Seals. Anarin was pleased that Asmodae had made such progress.</p>
