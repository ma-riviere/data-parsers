          <p>Ah, [%username]! I've been continuing my examination of the Ancient Dragonbound Document.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could spend years poring over it, but I found something that could be of immediate use to you--a Stigma slot ceremony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, even a few Dragonbound could ascend. That fact alone is extremely interesting.</p>

          <p>Hah, I agree. But the ceremony's unlike anything I've ever seen, and it doesn't seem dangerous. It might be worth trying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garath], a Stigma master, was very interested in my findings. He wants to be the first to perform it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He will require assistance in both preparing and executing the ceremony. Would you be willing to aid him?</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garath] is right upstairs. I've already told him to expect a Daeva willing to help him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I must warn you that if I understand the ceremony and its needs correctly, what he asks of you may be extremely difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the rewards will be great, for our knowledge of the Dragonbound and Stigma slots, and for you personally.</p>

          <p>I understand that you may be reluctant to participate in a ceremony created by the Dragonbound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've examined it carefully, and I assure you there is no danger at all. And a new Stigma slot would be of great use to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't take my word for it. Ask others, think it through. Return to me if you change your mind.</p>
