          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Have you ever heard of the Fortuneers Legion? They're a small crew of bounty hunters working between Elysea and Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a couple of decorated ex-soldiers amongst their ranks, but now they're basically just...privateers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, their captain asked that I relay a message to you....</p>

          <p>They want you to join them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their captain still has some friends in the military legions, and he heard some stories about your conquests. He's a good Daeva, goes by the name Juris Po.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rest of his crew I can't vouch for. But Juris, he was one Abyss of a soldier. Best I've ever seen. And he wants to meet with you.</p>

          <p>Good, good. But I'll warn you right now, it's dangerous work. You won't just be collecting bounties and finding lost treasure...you'll also be part of a hush-hush extermination posse.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> It's Sanctum's little secret, I guess you could say. When there's no time for a court ruling, you hire the Fortuneers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You've been to Inggison, right? [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos] is waiting for you out there. Find where the ale is coldest, and you'll find Juris.</p>

          <p>I understand that you might have some reservations about joining the Fortuneers, [%username], but they're not the blood-thirsty bunch of cavaliers you've heard rumors about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, actually, they kind of are.... But they also have the blessing of Sanctum behind them! Their bounties are all official! They do the missions that soldiers either can't or won't do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen...you don't have to join them. Just talk to Juris Po. Let him explain it to you, all right?</p>

          <p>I've been keeping an eye on you, [%userclass]. You're headstrong, callous, pugilistic, and a little unorthodox...a perfect candidate to join my crew.</p>

          <p>No matter, [%username]. We pillage and plunder in the name of Sanctum, and we give no quarter to our enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We perform jobs most soldiers fear to take, and we're well compensated for it. We all chose a life of adventure...and now we're expanding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're not looking for a lifelong spouse, just a good Daeva who can pull together with the rest of us. You savvy? Think about it. I'll be in touch.</p>
