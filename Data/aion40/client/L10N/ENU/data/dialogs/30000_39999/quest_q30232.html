          <p>The Fire Spirits just told me something quite interesting, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They said a great battle took place here in ancient times. And in this battle, a Flame Spirit name Flarestorm was imprisoned by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know what they did to poor Flarestorm? They trapped it in a latrine incinerator and forced it to burn their waste for an eternity. Poor spirit is still trapped in there.</p>

          <p>I've developed a sort of kinship with these Fire Spirits. I refuse to let one be tormented like that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're one of the most skilled [%userclass]s I know of, [%username]. Would you help me to free Flarestorm from this horrible fate?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The incinerator is in the Beshmundir Temple, they said.</p>

          <p>Poor Flarestorm has been contaminated by so much foul waste that he's turned blue. Who knows what those Balaur eat for that to happen! You will find the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCatacombs_SZ_D2] in a corner of the Garden of the Dead inside the Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go there and return [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_ElementalFireNmd_55_Ah] back to the flow of Aether. It's been there for quite a long time, so you may need to fight him repeatedly for it to work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, that item I gave you earlier is a key to the Blue Flame Incinerator. Use it to open the door.</p>

          <p>I'm sure he still suffers from the contamination.... A thousand years submerged in Balaur waste doesn't wash away so easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I have faith that he will be completely free one day...if he can count on Daevas like us.</p>
