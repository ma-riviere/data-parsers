          <p>This is only minor setback! Sesinerk will not give up dream so easily, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only need to find the way. Have been thinking, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_c20] may know something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daarunerk is smart and has much access to very old books. If anyone knows way to become Daeva, it is him!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is in Sanctum, in library, naturally. Please ask him what he can tell me about ascending!</p>

          <p>What is that you say? Shugo wants to be Daeva? Why would Shugo want to become inferior being? No offense, of course!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To fly, eh? Hrm. Well, there is one old old legend, about Kobold who turned into Human. Used big heart, mysterious blue light, and marvelous stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What really exists that's close? How about Large Golem Heart, Cadella's Light, and Finest Accessory Flux? Best advice I can give!</p>

          <p>If dumb old Kobold can become Human, then surely superior Shugo can become Daeva directly, right?</p>

          <p>Determined to fly, Sesinerk asked you to see if the learned Daarunerk knew how to become a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daarunerk was dubious, but told you the legend of a Kobold who succeeded in becoming a Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you told Sesinerk, she decided to believe in the old story and try it out herself.</p>
