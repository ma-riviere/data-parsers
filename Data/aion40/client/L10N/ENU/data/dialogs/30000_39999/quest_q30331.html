          <p>There is only one way to prove the presence of a unique Spirit, [%username]. Earth, Wind, and Water have not done the job, so only Fire remains. Certainly, if we can summon a Fire Spirit, there is no way it can hide from view.</p>

          <p>Quite witty, Daeva. But I'm sure that a Fire Spirit is the proper way to proceed. All I would need are some Acheron Drake's Membranes. Quite simple to obtain for one such as yourself.</p>

          <p>Acheron Drakes possess great vitality and magical power, so their membranes will provide the perfect medium to summon a Fire Spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The perfect sort of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Bonedrake_DR_54_An]s can be found in the Dragonrest. Bring me 15 of their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30331a]s and our names shall be forever illuminated in history!</p>

          <p>I'm telling you, I'm confident this is the proper course of action. I admit that Water, Earth, and Wind have not demonstrated themselves amply, but there is absolutely no way that a Fire Spirit would not prove impressive. </p>
