          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I wanted to ask you about that bow over your shoulder. Reminds me of one I saw many, many years ago...something the Reians made.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sweet light of Aion, is this Siel's Supreme Bow? My goodness, it is! It has seen better days, but this is the bow--I remember it well now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did a [%userclass] like you come across this?</p>

          <p>It's shame it's in such poor condition, though. Its limbs are very worn and the wood looks like it's been chewed upon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I once heard that this bow could kill a Balaur from a thousand meters away. Never saw that, so I can't verify it...but I believe it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know a dependable Reian that can get that bow back in decent condition. Doesn't deal with Kinah or Mithril...deals in favors. Interested?</p>

          <p>I hoped you'd agree, [%username]. A Reian bow in this condition is...just a long stick with string on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I was saying, I know a Reian in Soteria Sanctuary...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios] is his name. He'll get that bow of yours back in pristine condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His process for repairing ancient weapons is rather unique...more of an acquired method, I guess you could say.</p>

          <p>But this is no ordinary bow, [%username], you must remember that! This is early Reian technology--it must be finessed in order to reveal its true power!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This bow has a hundred years of death and carnage attached to it! It must be repaired...it must have new life breathed into it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's your bow now. If you're happy with using a fraction of its power, the choice is yours. Just think about it.</p>

          <p>You...you have Siel's Supreme Bow? What are you doing with this, Daeva? This bow is far too powerful for a simple [%userclass] from Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This was the creation of my ancestors...the Siel's Spear Legion! This bow has sent thousands of Reian arrows through the chests of a thousand Balaur soldiers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahhh...but it has seen better days, hasn't it? As old as the wind, my father would say. Let me see what I can do...give it here.</p>
