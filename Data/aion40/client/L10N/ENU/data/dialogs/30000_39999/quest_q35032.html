          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Daevas, we have a duty to use our Aion-given Aetheric powers to guide and protect the Humans and Sapiens of Atreia. Countless of those lower beings have lost their homes to war and are wandering hungry through the world. We, the Alabaster Order, are honor-bound to help those less fortunate than we.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call upon all members of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand to acquire food, which we will then distribute to the poor creatures in Elysea and Balaurea who cannot provide for themselves. Some [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35032_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35032_02] and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_35032_03] are ideal. Please spend some time helping us to provide for the unfortunate, and bring your donations to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007]. Even your smallest contribution can be a gargantuan help to the needy.</p>
