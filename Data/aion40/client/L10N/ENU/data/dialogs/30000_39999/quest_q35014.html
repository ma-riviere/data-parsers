          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your vigorous efforts, we have been successful in promoting the well-being of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To build on this success, the Alabaster Order has commissioned Walking Encyclopedia Fuchsia to invent a device called the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35014]. The Eye activates when a non-Elyos passes by, and then it records the features of the suspicious trespasser.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on you, member of the Alabaster Order of Aion's Divine Hand, to retrieve the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35014]'s memory records in Theobomos and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35014].</p>

          <p>I'm sure it said to retrieve the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35014]'s memory records so that we could see any suspicious trespassers.</p>

          <p>Aha! It's too hazy for my liking, but I think I can see a figure with shadow-black wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must confer with the other officers of the Alabaster Order!</p>
