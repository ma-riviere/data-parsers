          <p>Aah, fresh blood. You know what they say, eh? Allied blood makes the Balaur burn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All right. I made that up. But the sentiment stands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fleeing refugees all describe [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_DrakanRider_60_Ae]s as the greatest threat. Can I trust you to bring me the dead Rangers' [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30513A]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to have them examined by our weaponsmithing masters to see if there's anything special about them.</p>

          <p>We've been watching the portals from Rentus Base constantly. So far, no Balaur have tried to use them to attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, the longer we wait, the more the risk increases, especially if Tiamat sends more forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Winnowing down the Vasharti Rangers would make a big difference. How did it go?</p>

          <p>Hmmm... yes, yes, this is all that I asked for. I'll have them sent to Pandaemonium at once for examination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat is breathing down our necks, [%username]. I trust we can count on your help in the future?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until then, take this reward and a well-earned break.</p>

          <p>Sorus said Vasharti Rangers are one of the most brutal forces at Rentus Base. You were asked to slay them and take their Balaur Bows.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and the Balaur Bows were quickly taken to be examined by experts for any special qualities.</p>
