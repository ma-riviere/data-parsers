          <p>If experience has taught me one thing about Dredgion crews, it's that they're tenacious as all get-out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'll keep coming and coming. We can't let our guard down.</p>

          <p>I needn't tell you how formidable Tiamat is. I know you came over on the Sadonics. You saw the Dragon Lord's might with your own eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if it were just Tiamat, we would have succeeded by now. It's the legions loyal to Tiamat that are holding us back.</p>
          <p> </p>
