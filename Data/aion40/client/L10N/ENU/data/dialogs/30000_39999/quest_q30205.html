          <p>I am not very familiar with Inggison yet, so I'm afraid I cannot offer any in depth knowledge about this place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can at least guide you in the right direction, though. Still interested?</p>

          <p>Faith and arms, [%username], that's good to hear. First, you'll need to find the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF4_DragonTablet_Q30205]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can't miss them--they're monuments engraved with the history of the Dragon Lords. And this history may shed a little light on our enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need rubbings of all the monuments. Can you handle that?</p>

          <p>There's a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF4_DragonTablet_Q30205] for each of the Dragon Lords...but only four have been found to date. We're actually still trying to find Tiamat's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any one of them might contain the clues we're looking for, so bring me rubbings from all four. They're scattered all over Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And keep your back to the sun, [%username]. This is still undocumented land...expect hostile forces everywhere.</p>

          <p>Please tell me you've found at least half of them by now.... And please don't tell me that you haven't left yet!</p>

          <p>Outremus's anger knows no limits. If you go and get me the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF4_DragonTablet_Q30205] rubbings now, perhaps we can forget about your little nap in the woods.</p>

          <p>These are interesting, [%username].... I recognize some of these symbols.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had hoped at least one of these would contain some insight into Beshmundir Temple...but they don't. This one mentions a shrine, this one some other temple...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But nothing about Beshmundir. It's like they deliberately left all reference to it out. Looks like you'll have to search elsewhere, Daeva.</p>
