          <p>By Azphel's wings! Could that be...a Siel's Supreme Bow?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where did you find that, [%username]? Bows like that are legendary--I can't imagine more than a handful still exist!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those bows were used by Lady Siel's Spear Legion in ancient times. I thought they had all been destroyed by the Balaur. Can I take a closer look?</p>

          <p>Oh no...this bow has been damaged. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The string is too loose, the shaft has been warped from overuse, and... Ugh! It smells like a Shulack's den! I'm not sure I want to know where you found this....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, if you can bear the smell for a while longer, I think I know how to fix this. Would you like my help?</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, [%username]. I didn't mean to imply that I would be helping. I don't have the skill. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I do know someone, or rather, something that can repair this. His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan], and he's a Kobold. I know, I know, but don't pass out the pitchforks and assemble a mob just yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find him at the Rhonnam Refugee Village. His blacksmithing skills are top notch, but don't get him started on cooking. He's the worst cook in all Atreia, and I get the feeling Elyos soldiers are sometimes among the ingredients....</p>

          <p>Does not cause indigestion, vomiting, or organ implosion--these are rumors! Tataka promises!</p>

          <p>This is rare bow, Tataka only seen few. Bow is badly damaged, but would be Tataka's honor to repair for Daeva. </p>
