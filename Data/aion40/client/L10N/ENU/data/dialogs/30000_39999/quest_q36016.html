          <p> </p>
          <p>Brothers and sisters of the Fortuneers Legion, we hereby decree a new bounty. Fortune and prosperity await you if you accept this perilous quest.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Summary: Legend has it that the Dragonbound filled this box with gold, jewels and fancy fabrics as an offering to their masters. It can be found in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_B3]. Heed my words: They will not part with it easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first Fortuneer who brings back this treasure will be rewarded handsomely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>- Decreed by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_36500], Fortuneers Legion</p>

          <p>From my experience, the more valuable something is, the more elusive it is as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How is your search going, [%username]? I must know what was inside that Jeweled Tribute Box. I must lay my eyes upon its contents. Show it to me if you have it.</p>

          <p>I've heard from other treasure seekers that the Jeweled Tribute Box is hidden somewhere in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_B3]. But no one who's found it has lived to tell the tale.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those shadow-cursed Dragonbound, I'll never understand them. Know what I mean, [%username]? They don't just worship dragons--they worship their bones! And they leave perfectly good treasures lying around to appease the bones. Just silly, if you ask me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But treasure is treasure, right? If you bring back whatever is inside that box, I'll fill your satchel with enough riches to make any Fortuneer envious!</p>

          <p>Those crazed Dragonbound, always sacrificing some treasure that could be better spent in the Dionysia Tavern. Ha, ha, ha! This could buy plenty of draughts, right?</p>
