          <p>At least we now know what we're up against. But we still don't know exactly where in Beshmundir Temple we can find Stormwing's prison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been looking over the Ancient Dragonbound Document, and it may hold that answer for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, it's so old that the section in question is badly damaged. Getting anything from it in this condition is impossible.</p>
