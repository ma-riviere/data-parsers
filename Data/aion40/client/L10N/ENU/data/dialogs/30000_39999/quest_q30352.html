          <p>I asked Merhen to recommend a skilled Daeva for a mission related to the Divine Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We recently discovered a passage there that leads to a location that's almost like a small Abyss, probably made by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're calling it an [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_SZ_All]. But even though we have a name for it, we haven't determined what's inside.</p>

          <p>Yes, we're looking for a Daeva who can carry out a series of missions in this Abyssal Splinter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Exactly what's in store for you, I can't say. All I know is we need a Daeva who can handle new situations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since Merhen recommended you, I suppose I won't find anyone better. [%username], would you like to help?</p>

          <p>If you head under the Divine Fortress, you'll meet [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Ab1_1011_TreasureGate_Da]. He manages the passage to the Abyssal Splinter. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just tell Gwal you're there to carry out a mission and he'll show you what to do.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you scared to explore a new Abyss? I'd be hesitant myself--in fact, I'd probably quit as an Archon if anyone asked me to do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry, I'll just contact Merhen again and ask her to recommend a different Daeva.</p>
