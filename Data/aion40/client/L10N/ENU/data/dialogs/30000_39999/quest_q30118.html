          <p>Not so easy to restore Siel's Supreme Greatsword. Let Tataka think how. Here have cookie.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Num num num...hmmmm...num num.... Needs a lot of work. But Tataka can do it. Tataka can fix this easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cookie recipe, I mean. Needs more mookie pickles.</p>

          <p>Oh, sword. Sword easy. Sword restoration requires Noxallon Ingot. Everyone know that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Battle between Lady Siel and Dragon Lord Tiamat made much heat and energy. Noxallon Ore created from that. Sort of like how cookies rise in oven.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Noxallon ore very rare, difficult to find. You want to try anyway?</p>

          <p>As far as Tataka aware, only a couple [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01_dark]s left, and Reian Tribe has most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tataka think you should talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aglauros], Reian elder. He has some, probably. Do what he want, maybe he might give you Noxallon Ingot. Maybe not though. Who know?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Daeva bring Noxallon Ingot, I fix Siel's Supreme Greatsword. Daeva bring mookie pickles, Tataka fix cookie recipe. Daeva choice.</p>

          <p>Daeva not care about weapon? Tataka can sympathize. Tataka not much care about blacksmithing. Prefer cooking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, Tataka is disappointed. Would have liked challenge. Also wanted to add extra Noxallon ore shavings to casserole. Help with taste. Not Human, Kobold swear.</p>

          <p>Been waiting for Daeva. Have everything ready to fix sword. Oven, I mean forge, all cleaned out. Mostly. That not Human blood. That...iron rust stain. See? Taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Tataka digress. You have Noxallon Ingot and Siel's Supreme Greatsword?</p>

          <p>Daeva play prank? Can't make omelette without eggs, and can't fix sword without Noxallon Ingot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually that not true. Can make omelette without eggs. Can use Scentbags instead, from....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sword, right. You do what [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aglauros] asks and get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01_dark], then Tataka fix Siel's Supreme Greatsword. And both things must be in Cube!</p>

          <p>Daeva back! Here, taste this. Eggless omelette. Daeva not overly concern self with gelatinous substance on top.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In meantime, Tataka fix sword. Just like baking bread. Take ingot...heat up...temper sword...add some food coloring...and....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tataka finished. But Daeva not finished with meal. Not like hum...ble omelette? That okay, Tataka try again.</p>
