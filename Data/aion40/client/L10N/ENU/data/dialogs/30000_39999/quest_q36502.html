          <p>Greetings, Fortuneer.</p>

          <p>How was your hunt for the Poison Maker? The bounty's higher if you brought him back alive.</p>

          <p>I suppose we should consider ourselves lucky that Venomiki didn't succeed in his plan. We all get our water from that waterfall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, Fortuneer, I just don't understand this grudge the Shulacks have against the Elyos. Poisoning our water supply? That's monstrous. But I suspect the Balaur or Asmodians put him up to it. No Shulack is quite that wicked.</p>
