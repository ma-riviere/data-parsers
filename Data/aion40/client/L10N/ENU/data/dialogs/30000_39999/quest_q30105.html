          <p>No doubt the Dragonbound in the Udas Temple are proving to be a test of endurance, [%username]. Imagine living with them for as long as I have....</p>

          <p>Believe me, I am far wearier of it than you. But we must break the enemy's will now, so we may rid ourselves of their plague once and for all.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Let us strike at the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_Fanatic_Magic]s. The Balaur have boosted their powers, and so removing these loathsome creatures will weaken the Dragonbound significantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Doing this once will likely not be enough--visible results will only be seen if we do it repeatedly. However, I am willing to reward your efforts each time you persevere. Are you up to the task?</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]! Every time we assault them in this way, it weakens them a bit more. I have faith that with persistence, they will eventually break and fold beneath us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a reward, I have some of the mineral we call Noxallon. As I may have said before, it aids with the enchanting of weapons, so it will prove to be useful for one such as yourself.</p>
