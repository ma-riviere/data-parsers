          <p>Once some time has passed, could you check in with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kistig]? I won't be able to get away, and who knows when you'll be back here again.</p>

          <p>Then I heard what happened to her in Silentera Canyon. I knew Nep had to be suffering--even if her feelings for him had changed, I knew his hadn't. So I sent for the remedy.</p>
