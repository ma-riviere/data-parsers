          <p>We've developed another little problem, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I spoke with the Brigade Generals about Gefeios's pickaxes...told them they'd be getting the partial order that you...procured from the temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now they want the entire order! They're doing some big public relations event with the Reian citizen council, and they want all the Daevas mining to be using genuine Reian pickaxes.</p>

          <p>Shh! Not as far as they are concerned! The generals are just trying to win support from the Reian citizen council.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one will ever see the axes but us--the generals will just see that the order has been delivered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to go back to the Lower Udas Temple and get more pickaxes! We can't let our little secret get out, [%username].</p>

          <p>Same drill as before...go to the Lower Udas Temple, kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_FanaticAsWorker_53_Ae]s and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30013a]s.</p>

          <p>So, that's it then? You don't want to get your hands dirty anymore? Just going to smear this problem onto the soles of my boots and walk away? I don't think so! What I stepped in, you stepped in too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you have no idea what I'm capable of! You don't want to see me angry. I'm the fix-it Daeva, and a lot of important Daevas owe me favors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you get your hide out to the temple and get those pickaxes.</p>

          <p>I just learned how influential our pal Gefeios is with the Reian Tribe and the citizen council.</p>

          <p>If we do him right with these pickaxes, we'll have the vote of the Reian elders behind us...and the generals off my back.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll make this short and simple, [%username]. Your career is the shard on the road that I avoid stepping on every day. You cross me, and I will step on it! And it will stink!</p>

          <p>Go back to the Lower Udas Temple, kill those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_FanaticAsWorker_53_Ae]s and steal their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30013a]s!</p>
