          <p>You know what my favorite part of Laize's Panoply is? The Gloves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're clearly the fanciest part of the Panoply, but looks aren't the reason they're important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rosarea didn't usually wear gloves, but when preparation for battle was almost done, she put on the gloves with a smile on her face...and turned into a completely different person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard the look in her eyes was amazing! Once she put on the gloves, no one would dare face her.</p>

          <p>Right now I'm putting all my efforts into Laize's Gloves. They're the showpiece of what will be a beautiful Panoply.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do have one concern though.... I still don't have enough Aether energy. With what I have, I don't think I can restore their original glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to ask you to help me, [%username]. You'll have the first pair of gloves once they're done.</p>

          <p>Take this marble, and use it to collect Aether energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Inside the Abyssal Splinter, you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_SilikaCannon_Ra_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Millipede_Sc_55_An]s. Kill them, and the Aether energy will be stored in the marble automatically. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hurry back! These gloves will be great when they're done.</p>

          <p>Daevas lined up to witness the moment Rosarea put on gloves. In fact, many of them even tried to challenge her to a duel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, when she accepted a challenger, she would always put on her gloves as an indication that she was willing to fight. She was very selective though. Many people left disappointed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no denying that Laize's Gloves are amazingly beautiful. Anyone who wears them will get quite a lot of attention.</p>
