          <p>I too have been to Rentus Base. I was patrolling the outer walls when the Balaur came.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I managed to escape, but not before I'd lost a keepsake from my father, a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30560A]. He was with the original Siel's Spear Legionaries, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you return to Rentus Base, I beg you to please look for it. I don't feel right with it in the Balaur's hands. I think I lost it while fighting a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_DrakanStrider_60_Ae].</p>

          <p>I've been aching to return to Rentus myself, but my orders are to stay put for now.</p>

          <p>Thank Aion you were there to search in my stead. Did you find the insignia?</p>

          <p>Yes! I'd recognize it anywhere, in any condition!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give me a moment to polish it. I can't stand the thought of a Balaur's touch on its surface.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may think this a minor deed, but to me, it is an act of great compassion. Thank you.</p>
