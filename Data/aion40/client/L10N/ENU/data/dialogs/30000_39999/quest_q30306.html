          <p>Have you ever heard of Udas Temple, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an ancient Balaur temple held by the Dragonbound. It's located near Undirborg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is our next best hope of finding the information we need.</p>

          <p>It is said that the first Dragonbound built it during the Millenium War, and that it housed a vast trove of tomes and scrolls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My studies have confirmed these legends, though we don't yet know if any of the Temple's libraries have survived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your task would be to go there and see for yourself if knowledge still lies within.</p>

          <p>Inside [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_DF4], there is a corridor called the Path of Reflection. There you will find the Path of Wisdom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think that's where the ancient libraries once were. Look for [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDTemple_AncientDocu_Q30206]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Almost everything of value was probably destroyed when Siel's Spear Legion attacked the Temple, but it's worth a try.</p>

          <p>Yes, this might be another wild qooqoo chase, as with the memorial towers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, searching it offers only the chance of failure. Not searching it at all turns that chance into a certainty.</p>

          <p>But we have little choice. If this fails, I don't have many more promising leads.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please find at least one [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDTemple_AncientDocu_Q30206]. That way I can tell if the effort truly is fruitless.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, this does mention something called "Stormwing" being sealed deep inside Beshmundir Temple. But it's just that one reference. Not even a hint of what "Stormwing" is, or why he, she, or it was sealed.</p>

          <p>But wait...! Ah! Now here's something we can work with!</p>
