        	<p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today, we are called on by Sanctum itself to hold back the chaos and protect all Elysea from disaster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deceptive stones have been distributed throughout Inggison by an unknown group. These may look like regular stones, but they disrupt Obelisks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on all members of the Alabaster Order to eliminate [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35023]s and immediately report your success to an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For Elysea and Sanctum!</p>
