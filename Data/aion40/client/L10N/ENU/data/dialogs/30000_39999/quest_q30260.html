          <p>I have all the materials prepared. I have a design, which is hopefully correct.</p>

          <p>All I need now is strong Aetheric power, and then I can make Laize's Breastplate, the most difficult part of the entire panoply.</p>

          <p>Let me tell you a story. Rosarea had always followed Empyrean Lord Israphel. But when he suggested peace with the Balaur, she protested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even when Lady Siel agreed, Rosarea cried, "No!" She stood in front of the Tower of Eternity with her wings spread and vowed she would not move until the madness had passed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She asked Lord Israphel to cease his quest for peace, but he didn't listen. She stayed in front of the tower, day and night, until the Cataclysm...when she vanished. Very Asmodian, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Hmm. It looks like Laize's Breastplate. It feels Laize's Breastplate. But look and feel alone are worthless without the power to back it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cross your fingers, [%username]. If the power isn't enough, you'll need to gather more. But if it is...well, you will own a masterpiece.</p>
