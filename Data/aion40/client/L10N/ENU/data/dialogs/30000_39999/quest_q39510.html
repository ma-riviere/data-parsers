          <p> </p>
          <p>Dark Cloudy Merchants be advised that Nightshade Clan Shulacks can be unwelcoming to Merchants in their territory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The organization experienced a minor setback today when a shipment was lost in the Jotari Wastes. Dark Cloudy Merchant Vanguard Zorinerk has not yet filed his report on the loss, as the Shulacks are holding him as involuntary guest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dark Cloudy Merchants are advised that this should not affect third quarter earnings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Request: Elimination of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackAs_57_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackFi_57_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackRa_57_An]s and reacquisition of Dark Cloudy Merchant Vanguard.</p>
