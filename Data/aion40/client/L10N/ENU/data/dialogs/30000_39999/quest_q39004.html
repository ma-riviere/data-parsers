          <p>First things first, [%username]: we need to get our troops back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ever since we landed, the Asmodians have been stalking us, picking us off when we're not looking. They come at night, mostly, and kidnap our sleeping Daevas from their tents. Every day we wake to find our camp a little smaller, a little weaker....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want them back. The morale boost would be huge.</p>

          <p>I heard Nevma sent you out to rescue the troops! He could have had you guard the perimeter, or rebuild the camp, but no... he knows where our priorities lie.</p>
