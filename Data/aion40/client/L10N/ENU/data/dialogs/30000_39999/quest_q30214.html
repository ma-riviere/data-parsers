          <p>Quite right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a fairly straightforward rewards plan to encourage volunteering on important missions. The idea is to collect the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_IDCatacombs_Certification_01] set and bring a number of them to me to exchange for a valuable accessory. A rare belt, for example.</p>

          <p>What do you think of the rewards plan concept? I'm of two minds about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the one wing, there are Daevas who would already go on these missions, and this way their rewards don't fall through the rifts. On the other wing, some Daevas need this sort of push...but do we really want to entrust such important actions to that sort?</p>

          <p>It is the wise Daeva who seeks more than honor and glory for their own sakes, but the belt is more than just a symbol of honor. It's also a useful item.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What sort of rewards plan would be worthwhile for you? Or another incentive altogether, perhaps?</p>
