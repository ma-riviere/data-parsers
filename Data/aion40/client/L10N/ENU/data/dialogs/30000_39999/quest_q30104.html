          <p>I fear there are more Dragonbound at the Udas Temple than any of us had anticipated. We must act before things move beyond our ability to control them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We still need to find out what the enemy wants, but for now dealing with this more immediate threat is a priority.</p>

          <p>Aglauros believes we should take out the enemy's leader. I concur, for he has the ability to brainwash normal Humans, turning them into Dragonbound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These brainwashed automatons blindly follow orders, so killing [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_FanaticFiNamed_53_Ah] at the Chamber of Guidance will surely bring chaos to the enemy ranks.</p>

          <p>Some of the other Daevas have questioned the need to eliminate the Dragonbound. They say they were once Human, like we were before.</p>
