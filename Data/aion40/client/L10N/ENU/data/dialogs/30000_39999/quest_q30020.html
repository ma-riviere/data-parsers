          <p>Sure...I can repair that Siel's Supreme Polearm of yours...make it sing again. But it won't be easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To restore its powers to full bloom will take quite a bit of work, and some pretty rare materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell you what...if you can get me the material I need, I'll fix up your polearm and make it hum with power once again.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to see you're a Daeva who knows a good weapon when he sees one.</p>

          <p>I'll fix this old gal up in no time...it'll be the strongest weapon out there on the battlefield again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I get to keep what's left of the material after! You get it, I fix your polearm for free, and I get some rare metal. We have ourselves a deal, Daeva?</p>

          <p>What I'm going to need for you to get is very rare...and very old. Ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? It's probably a little before your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a special ore that was birthed when the great Lady Siel fought Tiamat before the Cataclysm. Their energies produced an immense heat that turned coal into this special ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only soul around here who has some is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus]. He fashioned them into ingots. You'll probably have to do a favor for him, but he should give you one in return.</p>

          <p>And you're just going to let it fester in ill-repair like that? Do you realize what this old gal is capable of, Daeva? I've seen one of these tear through a dozen Balaur in the blink of an eye!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you're content keeping all that power bottled up under dirt, dings, and dried blood, are you? Fine!</p>
