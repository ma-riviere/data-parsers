          <p>[%username], remember our little situation from earlier? About the Reian blacksmith and his pickaxes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Helping him would really shed a friendly light on our public relations with these people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought of a way to help...but it's not as simple as I think you or he had hoped.</p>

          <p>What I'm proposing is very unorthodox...could land us in a heap of trouble, but it will help out our Reian friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to go to the Lower Udas Temple and steal pickaxes from the Dragonbound there. Pretty dangerous, but that's the only way I can think of to get that many pickaxes so quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must keep my hands clean on this one, so I'm afraid it's all up to you, [%username].</p>

          <p>I heard you've already been to the Lower Udas Temple and know that the Dragonbound are digging a large tunnel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I said, it's a dangerous mission, but I know they'll have dozens of decent pickaxes to take.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll probably have to violently remove the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30013a]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_FanaticAsWorker_53_Ae]s.</p>

          <p>Not bad, not bad. These aren't the best-looking pickaxes I've seen, but they'll work for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our pal Gefeios may need a few more, but these should hold off the generals for a few days. I'll have some Daevas take them over.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I feel better now, don't you? And who says we don't give a shard about the Reians, huh?</p>
