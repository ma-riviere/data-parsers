          <p>Only one reason brought me to Inggison--to discover a new Spirit the likes of which no Daeva has ever seen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The way I figure it, Balaurea has different creatures than Elysea, so there's a pretty good chance that Balaurea also has different types of Spirits as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could just find one and harness its power for combat, I'll be the envy of every Spiritmaster from here to Sanctum. I'll be a living legend!</p>

          <p>I'm not so much "vain" as "self-confident." If I'm not proud of myself, who else will be?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, can you help me out? I need to find a certain item so I can get started.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like they say, behind every good Daeva is a Daeva's shadow. Would you be my shadow on this one?</p>

          <p>I hoped you would agree. You obviously know how to recognize potential for fame, [%username]. Stick with me and I'll put your name in the books, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The material I need is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30228a]s. They will allow me to summon a Tree Spirit from a different realm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Xipeto_Stone_53_An]s at the Scar Canyon. I urge you to be as prompt as you can be--time is of the essence.</p>

          <p>Interesting.... I just assumed that you would recognize my great talent and choose to help, no questions asked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're giving up a wonderful opportunity to etch your name into Atreia's history books, Daeva.</p>
