          <p>Pardon me for a second, [%username]. That mace you have...this may sound a little crazy, but that wouldn't be Siel's Supreme Mace, would it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought I recognized its design but I wasn't sure until you came over.</p>

          <p>Must have been a sizable debt to get a weapon like that! Too bad your mace is all beaten to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That piece you have there was one of the most feared weapons in Reian history. You need to restore it...bring out its raw power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can point you in the right direction of a skilled Reian blacksmith, if you're interested.</p>

          <p>I'm glad, [%username]. A mace with that sort of power locked inside of it...would be a shame not to use it. Especially considering where we are....</p>

          <p>Go find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios] in Soteria Sanctuary. He's the Reian I was talking about earlier.</p>
