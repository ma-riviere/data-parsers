          <p>[%username], I think I've got it! If [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF1] is just an alternative timeline that we can access now, then presumably the Hewahewa in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1] is going to go to Dark Poeta at some point in the future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we were to kill him now, that should change the future of Dark Poeta, shouldn't it? Maybe we can even prevent the incident from ever happening.</p>
          <p> </p>
      	  <p>What do you think? Will you help me try?</p>

          <p>You made it! Quick, tell me. Were you able to defeat Professor Hewahewa?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard his magic was quite powerful.</p>

          <p>Well done! I was giving this a lot of thought after you left though, and I don't know if it will actually work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, we already witnessed Poeta's future through the Abyss Gate, but still, if Hewahewa is dead now, then he shouldn't be able to contribute towards the creation of Dark Poeta, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All this time stuff makes my head heart. I wish I had a doctor around to help explain it to me.</p>

          <p>Tailos said that Professor Hewahewa in Tiamat Stronghold will cause the Dark Poeta incident. It might be possible to stop the events by killing Hewahewa now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned to Tailos after killing the Professor Hewahewa, he said that it's complicated because it already happened in the future. He is no longer convinced that the events of Dark Poeta can be stopped.</p>
