          <p>I'm glad you're here, [%username]. I've been looking for someone to take a special investigative mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've asked several Legionaries, but their constant failures drive me crazy. I'm through with that avenue of pursuit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think only experts are fit for special missions like this.</p>

          <p>Exactly. I don't think it's worth wasting more Legionaries on this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's an unexplored area in Silentera Canyon. We need to find out what kind of place it is, but Jotuns are preventing us from even getting close.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you up for it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Great. You need to head to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Underpass_SensoryArea_Q30057], north of Jotun Square.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a passage somewhere around there, I'm told. Find out what's in the passage and where it leads.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of the Legionaries I've sent have managed to get past the Jotuns. I think you can do better.</p>

          <p>Hmph. I expected more from you.</p>

          <p>I hate Silentera Canyon. I have to deal with Asmodians, Balaur, Jotuns...and incapable Legionaries to boot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now you're giving up on me? Pah. Leave me.</p>

          <p>Well, that's disappointing, but you've done better than the rest have, anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least now I know there's a huge door and something behind it. I'll have to take it from here.</p>

          <p>Lania said there's an unexplored area in Silentera Canyon. She sent Legionaries there, but they couldn't carry out the mission because of the Jotuns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As requested, you went to the unknown area north of Jotun Square. You found a huge closed door with something screaming behind it.</p>
