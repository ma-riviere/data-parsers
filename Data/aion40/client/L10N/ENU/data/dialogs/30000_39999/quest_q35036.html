          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our vital Heiron Observatory is in danger. With the number of Black Spotted Clodworms on the rise in the Black Tears Swamp, they may overrun the Observatory at any moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We ask you to destroy five [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ClodwormRe_33_An]s and report your success to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>

          <p>Well, that's a relief. Both about the Black Spotted Clodworms and...well....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Y'know, someone was just telling me that the Clodworms were multiplying because of the Janusite.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear someone put Janusite on one of Heiron's main roads. I wonder if it had any other adverse effects....</p>

          <p>An Alabaster Order's call to action asked you to destroy the Black Spotted Clodworms that are rising in number.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did as requested and reported to Aiskyholos in Heiron, who relayed the rumor that Janusite may be to blame. He also thought you wanted a romantic encounter, but you turned him down gently.</p>
