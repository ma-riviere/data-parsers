          <p>Any Elyos fighting within Tiamaranta itself deserves the utmost of respect. Theirs is the most difficult of missions, advancing onward to Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A masterwork [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_37502A] is the very LEAST we can do. This work is a thrust of the very spear that stabs at Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm anxious to see your offering, to see the prize that will inspire our troops to victory.</p>

          <p>We are all being tasked to our cores and must face the pressures head on. I hope to see a worthy [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_37502A] from you soon.</p>
