          <p>We need more information about this. I've mostly been in Theobomos, and I'm not that familiar with Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to talk with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pino] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_OP]. He used to be assigned to Heiron, so he should have some good information for you.</p>

          <p>Dark Poeta? There's something I haven't heard mentioned recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily for you, I know it quite well. But why do you want to know about it? It's a terrible place.</p>

          <p>What? These clearly refer to Poeta. And as far as I know, Anuhart is the Brigade General of future Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if he's being promoted now and sent to Poeta, then that might mean...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], you must report this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Karuti] immediately! This could change everything!</p>

          <p>These orders. They say Anuhart is to be promoted and sent to Poeta?</p>

          <p>In Dark Poeta, Anuhart's brilliant leadership made the Daeva's fight exceptionally difficult. If we kill him now, none of that happens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username]. We can't delay even a second more. You must go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1] and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Anuhart_Named_60_Ah]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The future of Poeta could hinge on this moment!</p>
