          <p>Quite good. In fact, I'd like to make you an offer that will certainly prove worthy of someone with your skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a wide array of problems we must deal with here in Gelkmaros, and I need someone I can count on to tackle the most important of these. I'd like that to be you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can do this, I will of course see to it that you are suitably rewarded. Interested?</p>

          <p>Excellent. For each important fortress mission you complete, you will receive a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_IDCatacombs_Certification_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Collect enough of these, and I will gladly reward you with a unique item--a special belt that will enhance your abilities even further. I will await your return.</p>
