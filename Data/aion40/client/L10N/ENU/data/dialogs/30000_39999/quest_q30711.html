          <p>The Malefic Dagger!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's one of the most powerful daggers known to Atreia, [%username]! It was once a simple weapon, at least until it was used by the Dragon Lord [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA52] as she butchered [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Apsu], one of the original five Dragon Lords!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ever since then, the spirits in the weapon have spiralled down the dark path of hatred and spite. It's said that whoever touches it loses their soul in a heartbeat! Remarkable both that you found it, and that you were not tainted...</p>
