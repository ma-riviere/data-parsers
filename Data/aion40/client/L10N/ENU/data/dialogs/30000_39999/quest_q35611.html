		<p>Radiant Ops HQ rewards extraordinary service. If you've acquired fourteen, thirty or sixty Radiant Tokens, you qualify to receive special military supplies in exchange for your Tokens.</p>

		<p>I don't know exactly what's in each supply package, but I do know that the items they contain vary based on the number of Tokens you've earned.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Different supplies are available for different numbers of Radiant Tokens. How many Tokens have you earned?</p>

		<p>Fourteen Tokens? Very impressive, Daeva. You must be quite skilled.</p>

		<p>Thirty Tokens? Amazing! You must be something to watch on the battle field. It's a pity we don't have more agents like you, [%username]. If we did, we'd be able to clear our mission books in no time.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>These supplies are quite impressive, but I've heard that even better supplies can be obtained if you collect 60 Tokens. And with your skills, that seems entirely possible. Do you still want to trade in your tokens?</p>
