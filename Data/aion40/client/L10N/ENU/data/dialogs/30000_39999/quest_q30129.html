          <p>This blade.... The workmanship.... The...yes! This is definitely what I thought. Siel's Supreme Dagger!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...it's very clear that this dagger isn't as powerful as it could be. Time and all this damage...! Look at that cracked blade.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'd be a pity to not repair it. Are you interested in restoring the dagger's power?</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I can't do it. It's a little out of my range of expertise. Fortunately, I know who you can talk to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Rhonnam Refugee Village and look for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan], a Kobold blacksmith. As a native of Gelkmaros, he should be able to help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I warn you, though, he's a little...odd. You'll see what I mean.</p>

          <p>Oh? Are you sure? I'd think that Daevas on the front line would take any opportunity to strengthen themselves.</p>

          <p>Try Boiled Qooqoo in Greenberry sauce! Very spicy!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or maybe Ground Roasted Mookie? It melts in mouth! Melts mouth too a little, but will work on that!</p>
