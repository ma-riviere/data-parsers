          <p>Welcome back, [%username]. I've given it a lot of thought, and I believe that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_ShulackScientist_50_Ae] at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1] is the same Hewahewa in future Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe if we kill him now, it will influence how future Dark Poeta turns out.</p>
          <p> </p>
      	  <p>It's at least worth a try.</p>

          <p>Excellent work! It'll be a huge help to our forces to have him out of the way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know if it did anything to change the future of Dark Poeta though. If it had, I think our memories of Dark Poeta should have changed, but I still remember it as it was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least, I think I do. Paradoxes with time, space, and dimensions aren't really my specialty.</p>

          <p>Garthenion said that Hewahewa, who's currently at the Tiamat Stronghold, will cause the events at Dark Poeta. He said it might be possible to stop the events by killing Hewahewa now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned from eliminating the Professor Hewahewa, Garthenion admitted he wasn't sure if it had worked.</p>
