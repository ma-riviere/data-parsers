          <p>I hope you don't find this presumptuous, good Asmodian, but I was wondering if you would accept a request of mine.</p>

          <p>A fellow Reian named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Altinard] wanders the Marayas Wilds. She's the mother of one of my oldest friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the Dragonbound killed her daughter. She's become obsessed with vengeance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid of what might happen to her. Could you find her, perhaps convince her to return here with you?</p>

          <p>Thank you. I don't know where exactly [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Altinard] is, so please search for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell her I sent you. Hopefully my name still carries some weight in her heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only pray to Lady Siel that you find her before her grief drives her to do something foolish.</p>

          <p>Yes.... I realize I'm asking a lot from someone who is basically a stranger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps she'd be more likely to listen to me anyway. But I am not as strong as a Daeva.</p>

          <p>Well, I can't sit around doing nothing. I'll solve this problem somehow.</p>
