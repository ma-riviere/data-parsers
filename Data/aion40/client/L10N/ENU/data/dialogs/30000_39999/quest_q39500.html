          <p>Oh, [%username], do you have a minute?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I got this weird membership offer in the mail. It says, "The Dark Cloudy Merchants need YOU!" They're a Shugo traders' group, but... not the Black Cloud? I guess? I can't really tell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm stuck here, so maybe you could check it out. It says to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4a_04] for more information.</p>

          <p>Shureth asked if you'd ever heard of the Dark Cloudy Merchants, who'd sent her a membership offer. She couldn't tell if they were affiliated with the Black Cloud Traders or not, and suggested you investigate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You met Chicorunerk, who claimed that she'd never heard of the Black Cloud Traders, even though her organization seemed exactly the same, even with a similar name. She invited you to join their organization.</p>
