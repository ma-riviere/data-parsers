          <p>Daeva should know, process not simple. Daeva must gather three materials, kind of hard to get. Daeva must then go to scary place, forge them together.</p>

          <p>Daeva up for it?</p>

          <p>Okay, Daeva need some things. First need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01] from Sealed Balaur in Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva then help Shulack in Grave Robber Band to get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a]. Also need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]--that special mineral Shulacks use. Shulacks weird. Talk funny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Daeva get all that, go to Debilkarim's Forge furnace. Put everything in there with orb and forge. Out pop Essence of Siel crystal. You bring that to Tataka.</p>

          <p>Tataka think Daeva probably right. Tataka got better things to do to, like bake bread.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva want, Tataka have shopping list. Daeva can buy those ingredients. Only need 50 or so things. Should only take a few weeks.</p>

          <p>Daeva better stand back. Tataka work wonders with Essence of Siel now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva must decide though. Use Essence to make new orb, or use Essence to make bowl of soup? Tataka has great idea for...why Daeva look at Tataka like that? Just kidding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, Tataka finished orb already. Shiny. Tataka almost want to keep. But won't! Tataka honorable.</p>

          <p>You obtained the Vorpal Essence, Special Shulack Refiner, and Blessed Aurium Ingot, and went to the Jotun Studio. You forged them together with the Noble Siel's Supreme Orb to make a crystal called the Essence of Siel.</p>
