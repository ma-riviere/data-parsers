          <p>There are so many problems to deal with here in Gelkmaros--I have never known stress like this before! To think, I believed all there was to do was fight the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am already indebted to you, [%username], but I am afraid that I must ask....</p>

          <p>Yes. I had considered asking a different Daeva, as I did not wish to trouble you, but I quickly realized that there was no one better-suited than you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if it takes you a while, in between your other tasks, I'd rather wait longer for a competent Daeva to get the job done than rely on an incompetent one and face disappointment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So--do you have time to help me?</p>

          <p>There are many tasks to accomplish here in the fortress, too many to mention now. For each one of these that you complete, you will receive a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_IDCatacombs_Certification_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring me back all of these certificates, and I will duly reward you with a splendid head accessory, one which will come in very handy in battles to come.</p>

          <p>I understand completely, Daeva. You're not the type to bite off more than you can chew. Committing oneself only to what one is capable of is a sign of responsibility.</p>
