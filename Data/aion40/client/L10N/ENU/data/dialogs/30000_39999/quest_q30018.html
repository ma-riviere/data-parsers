          <p>Your Siel's Supreme Greatsword will need some work, Daeva...but I can restore its powers. It won't be easy, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's taken on some heavy damage! Did a dragon gnaw on this thing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like I said, I can fix it but it will require some work from you. Will you help?</p>

          <p>This is no typical sword, Daeva. I can't just pound out the flaws on an anvil and rub a stone up its sides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need in order to fix your Siel's Supreme Greatsword is extremely rare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only one Daeva I know has the right material. But if you can get that for me, I can surely restore your sword's true powers.</p>

          <p>Have you ever heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Insidium_01]s? Probably not...no one uses it these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an ore birthed from the immense heat and energy produced when Lady Siel fought Tiamat before the Cataclysm. That's what Honeus says, anyways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can ask him yourself. If [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Honeus] takes a shine to you, he'll give you the Noxallon Ingot...but he may ask you to run an errand for him first.</p>

          <p>But the moment you run into a pack of angry Balaur and you pull that chunk of dead metal from your sheath, you'll wish you had taken me up on my offer.</p>
