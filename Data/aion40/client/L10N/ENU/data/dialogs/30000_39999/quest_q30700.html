          <p>The Reians have started pushing forward to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_R1]. They claim that they can't trust us around the Asmodians, and wish to act alone. Of course it's all nonsense: they plainly want Siel's relics for themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, we must dance like diplomats for the time being. Lord Kaisinel has written to Kahrun, declaring Elyos intent to assault the Stronghold. It seems the message was received too late though: the Reian siege has already begun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't have time to organize a full assault, but we can turn to you and your allies for the time being. Your orders are to head to Tiamat Stronghold with your allies and begin the Elyos assault! Go now, before it's too late!</p>

          <p>Elyos! Haha. I should have known a [%userclass] like you wouldn't miss a fight like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat still lives, my friend. Our attack failed, but progress was made. We have not pierced the heart yet, but Balaur ribs are splintering under Reian pressure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speak to your superiors about your next steps. The Reians need to tend our wounded and repair our inventory. We'll resume our assault soon, once we've found the entrance to Tiamat's lair.</p>

	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>However, while fighting the Balaur, you met a Drakan prophet named Vhasha. He told you that Brigade General Tahabata was the key to securing the stronghold, so you killed her, and took the location only to discover that the entrance to the Dragon Lord's Refuge was elsewhere.</p>
	  			<p> </p>
	  			<p>Garnon then appeared implied that she knew the whereabouts of the entrance. Hoping to recuperate, you returned to Ancanus, reported your findings, and waited for your next orders...</p>
