          <p>What could Kahrun possibly be thinking, going after the Dragon Lord like that? But who knows? Maybe he really can kill Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If that happens, though, the Reian Tribe will get all of Siel's Relics. We can't allow that to happen.</p>
          <p>[%username], you need to go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDTiamat_SZ_T1] and help Kahrun defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTiamat_Tiamat_Drakan_Named_60_Al]. Then grab the Relics before Kahrun can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be easy, but you're the only one I can trust. Now gather your allies and get out there!</p>

          <p>Lord Marchutan...? I thought he had refused to help us in person!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait... You set this up, didn't you? You Asmodians, and your Empyrean Lord--you're in league with Israphel! This whole thing was a play to steal Siel's Relics!</p>

          <p>Even if I were to believe you, your so-called Lord is another story. Marchutan could have helped us from the beginning, but he just watched.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Lord Israphel hadn't showed up, it would have been Marchutan who stole the Relics. I should have known better than to trust you! This is the final trick I'll let you Asnodians play on me. We're done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least one good thing has come out of this debacle; Tiamat is dead. I will return to Kamar with the news.</p>

          <p>Israphel! His plots get more and more inconvenient. I must call the other Lords to council.</p>

          <p>Aside from our problems with the relics, once the other Dragon Lords hear of Tiamat's death, they will rush to fill that power vacuum.</p>

          <p>First, notify Commander [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Udvi] of Tiamat's death. I will send my scouts out to track Israphel, but I will need you to do the difficult work, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva who can defeat Tiamat can do anything, so I trust that you can find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel], take Siel's Relics from him, and bring them to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go back to the city and wait for news from my messengers. I will have them bring any clues to you.</p>

          <p>I can hardly believe it. Tiamat is dead, and Lord Israphel appeared and took Siel's Relics?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems almost impossible. I think that for now, it would be best if you didn't tell anyone else about Lord Israphel's part in this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll return to Pandaemonium and try to find a solution for what to do next.</p>

          <p>You fought Tiamat alongside Kahrun at the Dragon Lord's Refuge, and with Lord Marchutan's help, you succeeded in slaying the Dragon Lord.</p>
