          <p>Many good Daevas were displaced when Rentus Base was overrun. My friend Enetia died in my arms. Her last wish was that I take her engagement ring and give it to her fiance Autiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I lost it while I was battling the Vasharti Legion. I can't face Autiron without that ring. He's already depressed enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need an intermediary. Could you tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Autiron] what happened?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for sparing me this agony, [%username].</p>
