          <p>Mewrinerk just realized something! Jewel is nice, but cannot just weld onto ring and call it day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jewel has to be polished and cut, and ring nicely decorated. That is a bit outside Mewrinerk's abilities. But already asked Handicrafting Master [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lanse] to make!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With her skill, Vanilinerk will understand feelings for sure! But Mewrinerk has too much work to make trip to Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, Daeva, take Golem's Heart to her, nyerk. Do whatever she needs to make ring for Vanilinerk! Please!</p>

          <p>Daevas these days! They don't appreciate the range of what Handicrafting has to offer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All they want is the latest ring or greatest necklace. No mind for artistry or flexibility.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I digress. What is it you need from me?</p>

          <p>Ah, yes, I got his request and fee. Never made a ring quite like this before, but I enjoy the challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said in the letter you'd get any other items required? Good, because I need a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30410A], a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30410B], and a Finest Accessory Flux.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe at least two, maybe all, of them can be found in Argent Manor. Or so Mewrinerk says.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Lanse needed some extra items to complete the work. You got them, and Lanse was able to fashion the ring.</p>
