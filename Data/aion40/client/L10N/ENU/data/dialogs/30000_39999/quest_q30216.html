          <p>I have been poring over the ancient document you brought from Udas Temple, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of it is still a mystery, but I did happen to find out some interesting things. Did you know the Dragonbound have Daevas among them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're quite rare, but they exist. The document then goes on to describe a Stigma slot ceremony--I think for these very same Daevas.</p>

          <p>Strange, isn't it? There's a Stigma master named Reemul who showed great interest in these discoveries. But, then again, he finds just about anything about Stigmas fascinating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He thinks we can use the Balaur's method to open up a new Stigma slot--he asked if I knew anyone crazy enough to try it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, naturally, I thought of you. How about it? Feel like helping [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Daniele] out?</p>

          <p>I thought you might. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Daniele] is upstairs. Whatever he asks of you, don't take it lightly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure whatever he says to you, "fighting the Balaur" will most certainly be lodged somewehere in it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might get a new Stigma slot from it, though.</p>
