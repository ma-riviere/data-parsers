          <p>Sesinerk was thinking, though.... Getting Golem's Heart was bad enough. Had to get you to do for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to get three items that are just as hard? There is little chance Sesinerk can do that! At least not alone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not really know where to get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30410B], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30410A], and Finest Accessory Flux either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If can get them all, then maybe, just maybe, dream will come true! Please do this one last thing for Shugo's dream?</p>

          <p>Ah! Sesinerk felt it! Was Daeva! Just for moment, but turned into Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This means it must be possible! Sesinerk has not been wasting time! Dream is possible after all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, Daeva! Sesinerk has so much hope now thanks to you! Will continue search! Will never give up dream, ever!</p>

          <p>Full of hope that she could be a Daeva, Sesinerk asked you to gather the materials she needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You fetched the materials from Argent Manor. With them, Sesinerk actually transformed into a Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, a moment later, she reverted to a Shugo. Nevertheless, she thanked you, full of hope that she might yet achieve her dream.</p>
