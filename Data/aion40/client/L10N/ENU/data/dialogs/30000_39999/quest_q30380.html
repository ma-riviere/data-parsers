          <p>I'm sure you already know this, [%username], but the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAbRe_Core_02_ArtifactCore] only appears when the protectors of the Unstable Abyssal Splinter have all been defeated. Our other scouts can't seem to get to it, but since you've had such great success so far, we're hoping that you can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a high priority mission. The longer the Unstable Abyssal Splinter lasts, the worse the Aether flows around it becomes. We really don't want more of these things to appear.</p>

          <p>That's a relief. I'm sure that was quite a difficult battle, even for you, but I think we're all glad you were up to the task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to you, we won't have to worry about that again for a while.</p>

          <p>Great job. Here, you deserve a reward for your services.</p>
