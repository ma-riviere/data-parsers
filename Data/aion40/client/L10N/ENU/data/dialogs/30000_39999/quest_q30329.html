          <p>I think the Water Spirit I summoned inside the Opaque Bladder wasn't quite impressive enough to get my name down in the annals of history. Maybe we should try for something more weighty and obvious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An Earth Spirit might be a good idea, don't you think?</p>

          <p>To summon an Earth Spirit I need something that possesses an earthly vitality. Blood of the earth, sort of thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe an excellent source will be [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30329a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Neut_Worker_55_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Neut_WorkerHigh_55_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Neut_Fly_55_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Neut_FlyHigh_55_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find them at the Twilight Drana Farm, which you are no doubt familiar with by now?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It's standing right beside you! Well, more below you, I suppose. Underground. I guess it's a shy Earth Spirit. But again, it's totally unique. No one has ever seen one before!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is amazing! If admittedly unimpressive.</p>
