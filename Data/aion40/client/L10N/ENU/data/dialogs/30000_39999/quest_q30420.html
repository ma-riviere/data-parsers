          <p>I've actually known Davlin for years. I feel sorry for her. I can't imagine how hard it must've been to see her creations twisted by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I think about how they might've been used on the battlefield... I almost weep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now is not the time for tears. We must keep the Balaur from using Davlin's work against us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Ranger_60_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Golem_Melee_60_Ah]s at Argent Manor are the key. You must destroy them.</p>

          <p>You should feel privileged! You are among a chosen few allowed into Elementis Forest and Argent Manor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your people insist we allow more, but... it's a sensitive issue. Although the secret is out, these areas are still precious to us, not to mention valuable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, we'll have to share the bounty eventually. All the more reason to get the golems cleared out.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Still, Davlin created quite a few golems in her day. It'll take a while to clear them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, between her brain and whatever scraps are left after you're done with them, we can recreate her work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This reward came directly from Kamar. Take that as you will.</p>

          <p>There was great concern that Davlin's Hetgolems could be used against the forces of Atreia as Balaur troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To eliminate possible future threats, you went to Argent Manor and destroyed Loyal Hetgolems and Melee Hetgolems. Augis rewarded your accomplishment.</p>
