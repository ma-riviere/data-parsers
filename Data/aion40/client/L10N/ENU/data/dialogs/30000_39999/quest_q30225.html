          <p>Thank you for saving me, Daeva! I hated robbing graves for Dorakiki the Bold, but I was too afraid to say no to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But some good did come out of it. I had managed to hide away some of the grave treasures each week and give them to my starving villagers. They grew to depend on me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that Dorakiki the Bold is dead, and I no longer rob graves, how will my villagers get Kinah for food?</p>

          <p>Yes, very true, Daeva. Very true. Will you help me...help them?</p>

          <p>Will you be bad for the sake of goodness? If you don't, the villagers will surely starve to death.</p>

          <p>Oh, you are the kindest Daeva I have ever met.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here is my plan: Balaur Relics are high in demand on the market, so we get some and sell them. Should bring plenty of Kinah to the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best stuff is here in Beshmundir Temple...I'm sure a [%userclass] like you can obtain [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_IDCatacombs_Reric_01] with little effort.</p>
