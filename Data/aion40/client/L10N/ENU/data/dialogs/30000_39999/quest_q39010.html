          <p>So, Dimensional Vortexes. They're basically wormholes created by the movement of separate environments within Atreia's gravitational core. Different shards move in different directions, and when certain shards move in specific directions, the resulting vacuum creates temporary points which allow virtually instant travel.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best of all, we can now manipulate these wormholes, and travel to Balaurea and Asmodae whenever we please. SCIENCE. It's what brains crave, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Arena_Geniki_E_LHM] here will tell you how to use the Dimensional Vortex, and what we're planning on doing with it.</p>

          <p>The Sanctum Operations HQ was opened specifically because of the strategic value the Seraphim Lords saw in the Dimensional Vortexes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Being able to attack en masse through our own wormholes at any given time, targeting location throughout Atreia makes us incredibly agile and potent. However, the fact that the Asmodians can do the same makes us highly vulnerable. We must approach war with a new mentality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is why we exist, and that's why we've recruited the strongest and most experienced Guardians to join our ranks. We would like to be able to call on you too, if you're willing to help.</p>

          <p>Excellent. We thank you, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dimensional Vortex here has been set to take you to Brusthonin in Asmodae. It's not a vital location for the dust scratchers, and so functions as a fantastic staging ground for our new tech, and a fine proving ground for our new battle strategies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Enter whenever you're ready. Our forces in Brusthonin will be glad to have you onboard.</p>

          <p>Radaman told you about the Dimensional Vortex and introduced you to Giniki, a member of the Sanctum Operations Headquarters. Giniki told you that only exceptional Daevas were being considered for Dimensional Vortex missions, and offered you a place in his team. Giniki said that he was looking forward to seeing you fight in Brusthonin.</p>
