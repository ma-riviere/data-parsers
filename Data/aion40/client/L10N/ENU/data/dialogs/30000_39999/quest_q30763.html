          <p>It's finished! Remodeling the Reverse Field Control Device was easier than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, try using the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_30713a] on the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_IDTiamat_FOBJ_Dagger]. Get [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garnon]'s help, and she should be able to extract Apsu's Grudge into this glass bottle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring it back here when you're done. Just... make sure and get Garnon's permission first. I have to follow at least some rules.</p>

          <p>Apsu's Grudge!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's far too dangerous! The Reian Elders need to be consulted before such a rash action can be taken.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am sorry, [%username], but I'll need to confiscate that item. You need to find somewhere else to be, or else the Elders will sanction you too. As it is, Grais is going to have a lot to answer for.</p>

          <p>He took Apsu's Grudge from you and said Grais would have to answer for her actions.</p>
