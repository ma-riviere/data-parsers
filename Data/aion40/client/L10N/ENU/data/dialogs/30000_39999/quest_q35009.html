          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today, we are called on by Sanctum itself to hold back the chaos and protect all Elysea from disaster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A deceptive ore hasbeen distributed throughout Heiron by an unknown group. It may look like regular ore, but it disturbs the Aetheric Field and flight devices. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call on all members of the Alabaster Order to eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q35009] and immediately report your success to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For Elysea and Sanctum!</p>
