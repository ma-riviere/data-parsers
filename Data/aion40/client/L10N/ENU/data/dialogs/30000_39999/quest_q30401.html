        <body>
          <p>There's a reason I've been so secretive. This involves a very sensitive project, known only to a few.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of our tribe, Davlin, has a talent for creating golems. She had a mansion built deep in Elementis Forest so she could work in peace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it seems she was attacked by a Balaur contingent led by a Drakan named Zadra Spellweaver. Fortunately, one of Davlin's Hetgolems escaped with this news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Brenon] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDElemental_1]. He's been scouting the situation, and will have more to tell you, I'm sure.</p>

          <p>Huh? An Elyos, here? How'd you even get here? There's nothing here any....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, Sierrac sent you? Thank Aion!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Argent Manor lies deep within the forest, but Elementis too has been twisted by the Balaur. And there are other barriers.</p>

        <body>
          <p>There's also [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElementalN_Nmd_Farmer_60_Al]. It's one of Davlin's most powerful golems, created to guard the forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zadra corrupted it along with the others. Now it guards the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30401A], the one object that can penetrate the barrier over the mansion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zadra is powerful, but not enough to destroy the Magic Stone. That's our chance. Take it back to Sierrac once you get it.</p>

          <p>So you've been to Elementis Forest. Then you must have seen how beautiful it once was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, it may still be now, but with the Balaur's evil infecting it, I'm afraid it's a mere shadow of its former glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps freeing Davlin will free the forest as well. Did you find a way into the mansion?</p>

          <p>A pity you had to destroy Tuali. But hopefully Davlin can restore it... once she is safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As an elder of the Reian tribe, I have the power to transfer the Magic Stone's unique qualities to you.</p>

          <p>Kutura galatha Siel manani.... There! Now you will be able to freely pass into Argent Manor.</p>

          <p>Sierrac told you that Davlin, a talented Golem creator, had been imprisoned in Argent Manor by Zadra Spellweaver, a powerful Drakan magician.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He sent you to Elementis Forest to speak to Brenon, who'd scouted the area. Brenon told you of the Magic Stone, which could penetrate the barrier placed over Argent Manor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Tuali, a corrupted golem, to gain access to the Magic Stone. Sierrac then transfered its power to you so you could enter Dorgel.</p>
