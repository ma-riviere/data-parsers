          <p>How is that Noble Siel's Supreme Polearm serving you, my Elyos friend? It looks like she has seen better days and one too many battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's time to upgrade it? Perhaps you are ready to carry Siel's Dominant Polearm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask for nothing in return, but you alone must obtain the needed items and refine the weapon yourself.</p>

          <p>Like I said, you'll have to do the legwork yourself, but that shouldn't be too difficult for a [%userclass] of your caliber.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sound good?</p>

          <p>I mentioned a few things that I would need first--Vorpal Essence, a Shulack Special Refiner and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has it. And while you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>Daeva, I know you are eager to upgrade your weapon, but the horse pulls the cart. Not the other way around. Everything in its order.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] first.</p>
          <p> </p>
