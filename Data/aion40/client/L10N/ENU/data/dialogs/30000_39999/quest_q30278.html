          <p>Now that Kaluva and its webs are gone, the way is clear to the Crystal Mezzanine. Of course, this also means that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_FiNmd_Combine] has a clear path out, so you'd better put a stop to that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pay attention now, because this fight will be different than most. Unstable Dayshade splits itself into two parts, and you must use each part against the other to kill it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After splitting into [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Guardian_Light_Fi_60_Al] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_02_Boss_Guardian_Dark_Fi_60_Al], you'll see two disks: an Unstable Piece of Splendor, and an Unstable Piece of Midnight.</p>

          <p>Take the Unstable Piece of Midnight to Rukril to dissipate it's shield, and do the same with the Unstable Piece of Splendor and Ebonsoul. Each is neutralized by the disk that came from the other, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most importantly, once their shields are down, you must try to kill them both almost simultaneously. Otherwise the survivor will get exponentially more difficult to fight.</p>

          <p>As you probably guessed, there's something even more dangerous hiding in there, but I'll talk to you about that when you come see me again.</p>
