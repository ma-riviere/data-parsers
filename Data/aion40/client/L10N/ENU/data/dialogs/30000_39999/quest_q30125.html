          <p>[%username]! Is that an Siel's Supreme Orb?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I admit that items of that sort are not my specialty, but even a blind Shugo would recognize that just from its aura of power.</p>

          <p>Fascinating! May I take a look at it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's wonderful! Just look at the...oh, no.... That's too bad. The orb seems to have been seriously damaged at some point in the past. Did you drop it? See this crack here?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could restore this, you'd have yourself a truly outstanding orb. Would you be interested in doing that?</p>

          <p>I don't know the first thing about fixing orbs, [%username], but I know who might.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In Rhonnam Refugee Village there is a...person named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF4_NPC_Nehmatan]. He's a Kobold who fancies himself a cook, but I happen to know he's also a talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If anyone can fix this orb, it'll be him.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess if you're really not interested, I won't bother you. An orb like this is really only valuable to someone who can fully appreciate it.</p>

          <p>That an Siel's Supreme Orb! Tataka know of this. Siel's Spear Legion, ancestors of Reian Tribe, used this. This ancient!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It also look ancient. You find at a rummage sale? Look at scratches and cracks. Pffff. Shame.</p>

          <p>Tataka could help restore its powers, though. Maybe. Let him think.</p>
