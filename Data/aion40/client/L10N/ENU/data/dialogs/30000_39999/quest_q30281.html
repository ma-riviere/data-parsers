          <p>We're going to have to destroy the Unstable Holy Orkanimum Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>New creatures get created within the fragments, and with the Aether fields the way they are, well, let's just say that what comes out of those things isn't suitable for a petting zoo in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Head to the Unstable Abyssal Splinter and get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAbRe_Core_02_Seed]s. You'll find that destroying them also causes your DP to recover.</p>

          <p>Good. It's much easier to destroy a problem while it's small than once it's turned into big, angry monsters with giant teeth and acidic drool.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps if we'd taken that approach with the Asmodians... Well, regardless, I appreciate your help.</p>
