          <p>Have you ever heard of the Jotun? Perhaps not. They lived long ago in Atreia, and created Aion's Soldiers, which you call Petraliths.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were thought to have vanished along with the Petraliths, but according to this document, that is not true!</p>

          <p>The document indicates that the Balaur and their Followers seized Udas Temple not for what is inside the temple, but so they could tunnel beneath it. They plan to infiltrate Jotun Studio and take an energy source used to power Aion's Soldiers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I knew what they wanted with the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDTemple_GiganticCore_Q30008]. Whatever their plan, we have to get that energy source before they do. Can I count on you to handle this, [%username]?</p>

          <p>If this tunnel exists, then Jotun Studio can be accessed through the Lower Udas Temple. Enter the passage next to the Shadowy Prison and then pass through the Toxic Caverns to reach the tunnel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDTemple_GiganticCore_Q30008] should be easy enough to find. Most likely you will find it on some work bench or other in the deepest part of Jotun Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obviously, you will face strong opposition from both Dragonbound and the Jotun, [%username]. Use caution.</p>
