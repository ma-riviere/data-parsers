          <p>How is that Noble Siel's Supreme Bow serving you, my Elyos friend? It looks like she has seen better days and better battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it's time to upgrade it? Perhaps you are ready to carry Siel's Dominant Bow now? It is far superior to what your hands clutch now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask for nothing in return, but you alone must obtain the needed items and refine the weapon yourself.</p>

          <p>Like I said, you'll have to do the legwork yourself, but that shouldn't be too difficult for a [%userclass] of your caliber.</p>

           <p>I mentioned a few things that I would need first--Vorpal Essence, Shulack Special Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with the Essence of Siel crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>One day, perhaps soon, your bow will fail you. Or its aim will be faulty. Or its strength a bit too shy to reach your enemy.</p>

          <p>Daeva, I know you are eager to upgrade your weapon, but the blood only follows the new wound. That is an old Reian saying...it does not translate well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean to say, you must obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01] first.</p>
          <p> </p>
