          <p>An Elyos! It's been so long since I've seen one of our people. You see, I may look Reian, but I too was an Elyos once, during the Storm Legion's ecounter with the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of the Storm Legion, have you heard of my old friend Akarios? I suppose he'd go by Pernos these days. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I could see him myself... but my soul is now bound to this incense burner. Could you please tell Akarios what happened to me? I like to think that he still wonders.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Nice of you to visit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Daevas of your stature don't often make social calls. Is there something you need of me? Or...?</p>

          <p>Paudav? Really? I'd think you were making that up, but there's no other way you could even know that name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Paudav. That old egg-hatcher lived a long life after all, eh? I knew he was too stubborn to die that easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shame that he's dead now, but one of my oldest questions has finally been answered. My thanks to you, [%username].</p>

          <p>The soul of a Reian tribesman called Paudav appeared when you touched the incense burner just inside the Residential Zone on a Memorial Altar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Paudav said he was once an Elyos and wanted to contact Akarios, one of his former comrades in the Storm Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you talked to Pernos, also known as Akarios, and told him of his old friend, much to Pernos's delight.</p>
