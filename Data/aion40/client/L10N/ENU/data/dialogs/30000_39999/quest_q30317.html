          <p>I've been examining the ceremony myself. As a Stigma master, I thought I'd seen it all, but those balfired Dragonbound were on to something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've confirmed that it should be safe--it won't brainwash you or bring Drakan down on our heads--but I did discover a serious obstacle to performing it.</p>

          <p>It turns out that we need implements not seen in Atreia since the Millennium War.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Herka] to see if she can track them down for us.</p>

          <p>If you're still willing to help with this, you can start by asking her if she's made any progress.</p>

          <p>I've been thinking about that. I believe we've already discovered the solution.</p>

          <p>Namely, [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombs_NPC_DrakanUtra] in Beshmundir Temple. His name comes up in connection to the ceremony, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The summoning should still function, so you won't need any more Perfumed Oil. But I suggest you hurry, before the consecration wears off.</p>
