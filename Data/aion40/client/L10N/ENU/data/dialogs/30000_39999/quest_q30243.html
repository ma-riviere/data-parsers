          <p>Greetings, [%username]. I see that you are taking good care of Noble Siel's Supreme Mace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But your skills have progressed dramatically...far faster than your weapon has.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe it's time we did something about that....</p>

          <p>How about we improve Noble Siel's Supreme Mace for you? Turn it into Siel's Dominant Mace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need to do is get the materials and forge them...I can take care of the rest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've helped me out before, [%username], so there will be no Kinah accepted. Interested?</p>

        <body>
          <p>As I said, I will need a few items to begin. You'll need to obtain Vorpal Essence, Special Shulack Refiner, and a Blessed Aurium Ingot. A powerful Balaur sealed somewhere in the Beshmundir Temple has the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], I hear a Shulack captured by the Nightshade Clan has that. While you're there, see if you can buy the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01]...it's a Shulack mineral. Quite expensive, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you have gathered all the materials, bring them to the furnace in Debilkarim's Forge and forge them well. You will end up with Siel's Essence crystal. Bring that to me and I will do the rest.</p>

          <p>You've nearly torn that mace apart, [%username]! If you don't upgrade to something meatier soon, you'll be facing foes with a handle and not much more.</p>

          <p>Obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_Rudra_Essence_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30235a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Blessed_Aurium_01], then take them to the Jotun Studio to make the essence.</p>
