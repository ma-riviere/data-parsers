          <p>Last time we spoke, you'd gone to exterminate poisonous creatures in Silentera Canyon. Do you remember how you said they were easy to kill?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I found that odd and asked around, only to learn that most Daevas were being poisoned in Beshmundir Temple and not Silentera Canyon. By a gigantic Slime!</p>

          <p>Sadly, no. But now that I have experience with poisons made by the Dragonbound, I'm ready to analyze the secretions of our gluttonous Slime.</p>

          <p>All right. The Slime in question is known as [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDCatacombsN_HugeSlimeNmd_55_Ah], and they say it's big enough to fill a chamber in the Vault of the Conquerors underneath Beshmundir Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, I suspect it absorbs Balaur bones. Isn't that exciting?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why are you still here? Go bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30223a] so I can create an entirely new poison for our side and a better antidote for the afflicted.</p>
