          <p>But... if I did know a Paudav, I'd remember his kindness and his love for his friends and his people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd also probably say that he wouldn't understand why we Gergers have to stay here. He just doesn't understand what we've seen, thought, and done. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I would be happy that he still thinks of us, occasionally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you could tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vicios] that he's got friends among us Gergers?</p>

          <p>You're the Asmodian I met, aren't you? I could never forget such a meeting as ours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've only heard about the Abyss War secondhand, but it sounds like a terrible and destructive conflict.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gemyu and my other comrades are as much victims as anyone else. How are they?</p>

          <p>I see. I should've known it would take more than a few greetings to pierce their stubbornness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I'm glad they think so highly of me. I will not give up on them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for doing this for me. I pray this is a sign that your war may yet resolve itself peacefully.</p>
