          <p>[%username], you helped us advance beyond Kaluva's Nest, but I don't think we're going to get any farther without you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to investigate the deepest parts of the Abyssal Splinter, we must get through the Crystal Mezzanine.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>At the Crystal Mezzanine, you'll see [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_FiNmd_Combine] standing right in the middle. When the investigators get close to it, it splits into [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_Guardian_Light_Fi_55_Al] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_Guardian_Dark_Fi_55_Al].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe that both of them have to be killed at the same time to get past, but I can't imagine that'll be easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you have any ideas, [%username]?</p>

        <body>
          <p>Here's what we know. After splitting into [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_Guardian_Light_Fi_55_Al] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Boss_Guardian_Dark_Fi_55_Al], the Dayshade turns to disks lying on two sides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you fight them, they build a shield. Rukril makes a Splendor Fragment, and Ebonsoul makes a Darkness Fragment. We think that if you take the Darkness Fragment to Rukril, his shield will disappear, and that the same thing happens if you take the Splendor Fragment to Ebonsoul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It sounds complicated, but the most important thing is you have to kill both of them at practically the same time. If one collapses first, the other will become too aggressive to deal with.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, never mind. I'll try and get more investigators, even if it means sending a request to the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe then we'll be able to fight Rukril and Ebonsoul at the same time.</p>

          <p>That's a problem. Neither this Artifact nor its Protectors are going to be...normal. We must find a way to turn the Artifact back to normal so we can use it.</p>
