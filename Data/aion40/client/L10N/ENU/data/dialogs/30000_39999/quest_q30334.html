          <p>I know so little of my family. For as long as I can remember, my mother and I were the only ones left out of a once strong bloodline.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But before she was taken by the Dragonbound, Mother told me about a relative I never knew I had, an uncle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've asked passing Daevas to help me research his name so I could find out more about him. What I found...</p>

          <p>Worse. Pandaemonium's library had an ancient book that described him. His name was Taros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was one of the great warriors of the Millenium War, but he met with a cruel end--in exchange for the lives of his soldiers, he accepted a terrible curse of eternal torment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowing he still suffers... For my mother's sake, I must try to end his pain. Can you help me?</p>

          <p>Yes. I...I could sense it. I think my mother rejoices, even if her mind is lost to the Dragonbound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have done my family a great favor. I will do whatever it takes to repay the debt.</p>

          <p>Until then, have these boots. And take this--it's the book that described my uncle. At least now it has a happy ending of sorts.</p>
