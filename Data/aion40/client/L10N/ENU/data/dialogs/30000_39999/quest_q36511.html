          <p> 2. Charge: Causing Destruction to Elyos Research Equipment</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: Numerous witnesses tell of Valkinas the Scholar damaging equipment and interfering with vital research on the Balaur. Best approach to apprehension: lure Valkinas in by using the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LF4_FOBJ_Q36511]. Last known whereabouts: Wretched Garden.</p>

          <p>Some of those researchers believe that Valkinas the Scholar haunts the Wretched Garden because it's the location where she died. I don't think that's the case, though. I think she hid something there and doesn't want those medicine-makers digging it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It doesn't really matter why, I suppose--those researchers have emptied their purses to put a bounty on Valkinas's head.</p>
