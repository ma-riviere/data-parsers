          <p> </p>
          <p>All Fortuneers are advised to read the following proclamation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 1. Name: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_DayQ_FanaticRa_54_An]</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Charge: The Torture and Persecution of Reian Tribesmen</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details of Crime: After capturing and torturing Reian Tribesmen, Braid (also known as Cruel Braid the Dragonbound) proceeded to mutate his captives into Dragonbound. Last known whereabouts: Undirborg. Often travels on Windstreams.</p>

          <p>What is that? Is that...Braid's Leather Whip? You killed him? You actually killed him?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must say, [%username], you are a worthy foe for any rival. I would hate to see my name on one of your bounty proclamations. Now, let me get that whip from you and I'll see about getting you your reward.</p>

          <p>Is that Braid's Leather Whip? Did you actually manage to kill...oh, it's just your belt. Why in all of blessed Elysea would you wear a belt that looks like a whip, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to hear excuses! I want to hear that Braid met with some bladed justice! That's what I want to hear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now go get him! And no stopping at the Dionysia until you're finished!</p>

          <p>So, this is that cruel torturer's whip? It's heavier than I imagined it to be. I can smell the blood and the pain still saturated in its leather.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What a truly wretched tool. You've done well, [%username]. I hope you made Braid suffer before sent him into the darkness. Here, take your reward and go down to the Dionysia for an ale or two. And if you happen across Aleela while there, tell her to keep my favorite seat warm for me.</p>
