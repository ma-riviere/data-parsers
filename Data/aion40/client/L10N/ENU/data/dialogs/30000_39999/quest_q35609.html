		<p>Radiant Ops HQ offers special military supplies to those who acquire an extraordinary number of Tokens.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>The items contained in the supplies vary based on the number of Tokens you have, but we have no way of knowing exactly what will be in each supply package...until it's opened.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Different supplies are available for fourteen, thirty, and sixty Radiant Tokens. How many Tokens have you earned?</p>

		<p>Thirty Tokens? Amazing! I am suitably impressed. You must be something to watch on the battle field.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>With more agents like you, [%username], Radiant Ops would be able to clear its mission books in no time.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>These supplies are quite impressive, but I've heard that even better supplies can be obtained if you collect 60 Tokens. And with your skills, that seems entirely possible. Do you still want to trade in your tokens?</p>
