          <p>I...I took some co-workers and snuck into Abyssal Splinter without telling Branch Manager Jarumonerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But had good reason! I heard there was amazing treasure there! No one said it would be so dangerous. Akakak...heh....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Balaur and some shiny things chased me. I got out, but my co-workers are still inside. Do not know how many, either! Please help me rescue them, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Last time Ickulnerk saw them, they were in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Core_SZ_C]. They ducked into empty space to avoid Balaur, but a crystal trapped them inside!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, nyerk...they must have passed out from dehydration by now. Please, go save at least one of them, nyerk. I don't want to get in trouble.</p>

          <p>If Branch Manager Jarumonerk finds out about this, I might get suspended! So don't tell!</p>
