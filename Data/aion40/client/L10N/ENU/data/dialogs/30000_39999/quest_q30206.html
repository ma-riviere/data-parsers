          <p>[%username], have your travels taken you to the Udas Temple yet?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's an old Balaur temple near Undirborg. I fear it's full of the Dragonbound, but no one seems to know for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since those monuments didn't offer us any clues, I'm afraid that temple is our last hope of finding something.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDTemple_LF4] was built a millenium ago, according to my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Contrary to its current condition, historians say it was once a thriving temple. It even had a rich library of documents and literature from other cultures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of the books and documents have probably vanished by now, but whatever remains would be very useful. Any chance I could get you to search the temple for me?</p>

          <p>You're a real lifesaver, [%username]. Deep inside Udas Temple, there's a place called the Path of Reflection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Inside this corridor is the Path of Wisdom, which used to be the temple's library.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Search in there for an [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDTemple_AncientDocu_Q30206]. I doubt you'll find much else of use, but if you can get your hands on that...we may finally get the upper hand on these savages!</p>

          <p>I realize you're hesitant about going--there's always the chance that you won't find anything in the temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But even if the document isn't there, you'll still get a firsthand look inside that place. Maybe get the chance to practice your skills a little....</p>

          <p>Something called a Stormwing slumbers deep inside the Beshmundir Temple. No descriptions or locations...just that it slumbers or rests...for many years now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! What's this here...? Something else that's very interesting. I'll need to study this before I even speculate what it is...but it may be very useful.</p>
