          <p>Heading to Brusthonin, [%username]? If you are, I strongly suggest you talk to Ionia and Nevma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ionia is from Sanctum Ops HQ, and will teach about the unique risks to fighting over there. Nevma is the Brigade General of the Griffon's Claw Legion, which crash-landed in Brusthonin as they were heading back from a sortie mission in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Again, Nevma knows more about Brusthonin than most of us combined, and will be able to give you the most pertinent information and tasks.</p>

          <p>Good to see you made it, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard of many Daevas slipping through the Vortex and ending up lost... or worse. Terrible way to go, if you ask me, but you can rarely dictate the manner of your end when the time comes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, are you ready for some information?</p>

          <p>Giniki wanted you to know about the Dimensional Vortexes, and suggested you talk to Ionia, from Sanctum Ops HQ, and Nevma, the Brigade General of the Griffon's Claw Legion. Ionia warned you about the dangers of Brusthonin battles, while Nevma was clearly glad that you had come to help.</p>
