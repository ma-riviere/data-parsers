          <p>You know, if this weren't a work-for-hire, I'd probably put this ring on display. A prime example of my skills. Still, it is rather strange. Some of the materials and runes he chose...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of my business. Mewrinerk's letter to me said he wants you to take this ring directly to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF4a_02].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He apparently thinks you'll have better luck getting her to understand that Mewrinerk loves her. Is she really that dense?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the letter says that if you do this, he'll reward you even further.</p>

          <p>What? You have delivery for me? But Vanilinerk likes her liver! Do not want to lose it! Oh... present! Why you not say so?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mewrinerk? Why he give me ring? All he does is tell me he loves me and wants to marry me. But how he really feel?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But ring is really nice! Big stone! Love stones.... Love stars too. And sticks, and stripes, and everything beginning with "st"...</p>

          <p>She what? WHAT?! Oh, no! No, no! Vanilinerk! Oh, this is not at all what I wanted to happen...!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mewrinerk must come clean now, Daeva. Found design for love ring. Anyone who wears it falls in love with whoever you want.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it was bad thing, but was just so desperate! But something must have gone wrong! Oh, poor Vanilinerk, please forgive me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will ask around, but transformation should be temporary... I hope. Thanks for helping stupid Mewrinerk out, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Lanse completed the Ring of True Love. She told you that Mewrinerk wanted you to deliver it to Vanilinerk.</p>

          <p>When you delivered the ring, Vanilinerk was very pleased. However, the moment she put it on her finger, she transformed into a Snuffler!</p>

          <p>It turns out that the magic ring was supposed to make her fall in love with Mewrinerk, but something went wrong. You were rewarded anyway.</p>
