          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva is interested in improving mace? Or just come back for stew?</p>

          <p>As for to blacksmithing...Tataka need three rare materials to improve mace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will not be so easy to find, Tataka thinks. But Daeva is willing to try?</p>

          <p>Rumors spread that Sealed Balaur in Beshmundir Temple have Vorpal Essence. Tataka hear someone in Nightshade Clan have Special Shulack Refiner, or was it...someone captured by Nightshade Clan? Tataka not remember. Blessed Aurium Ingot is expensive mineral used by Shulacks. Tataka wish he knew more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Daeva has all three materials, take to Debilkarim's Forge and fuse together into Essence of Siel. Then bring essence back to Tataka. </p>
