          <p>Exactly right! She was a great Brigade General, and Empyrean Lord Israphel trusted her implicitly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, whoever knows her also remembers Laize's Panoply, with its beautiful violet shine. It offered perfect protection, or so the legends say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no master crafter, but I'm confident I have the skills to recreate each piece of Laize's Panoply in all its original splendor!</p>

          <p>I'm making good progress. I'm working on many different parts at once, but the shoes are complete. Well, nearly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, the shoes look the same as the originals, but its performance is lacking. I think it's because they don't have enough Aether imbued into them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think you could lend me a hand here, [%username]? If you do, I'll give you my prototypes! How about that?</p>

          <p>See this marble? It looks ordinary, but it can be used to collect Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard there are many creatures with lots of Aether at the Abyssal Splinter. That might be a good place to start.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this marble, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_SilikaCannon_Ra_55_Ah]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAbRe_Core_Millipede_Sc_55_An]s, and we can use the collected Aether to improve the shoes.</p>

          <p>Do you know why Rosarea was called the Warrior of Laize?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was so beautiful that many men fell in love with her. Yet she was determined to devote her life to fighting the Balaur, so she didn't return any of their love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of her many admirers wanted to get her attention--and make a point--so he gave her a Panoply engraved with Laizes, beautiful flowers covered with thorns that make them completely unapproachable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rosarea knew what it meant, but refused to put her own emotions ahead of the war against the Balaur. Still, she wore the Panoply even though she knew it represented the man's resentment. She wanted to let him know that she understood.</p>

          <p>That's definitely an impressive amount of Aether energy. But is it enough to complete the shoes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we won't know until we try. Let me give it a shot. If not, I'll need to ask you to get me some more later.</p>
          <p> </p>
