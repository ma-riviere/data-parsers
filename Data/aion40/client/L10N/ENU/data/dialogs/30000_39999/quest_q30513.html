          <p>Aaah. Fresh blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that you're here and clearly interested in reclaiming Rentus Base, I've got some information for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Based on reports from the fleeing survivors, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDYun_DrakanRider_60_Ae]s caused the greatest challenges. Would you kill them and take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_30513A]s for our researchers?</p>

          <p>I don't believe that the Rentus Base's strategic possibilities have been totally shattered by Balaur occupation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, we can't fully test that theory until the Balaur are fully driven out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Examining those Balaur Bows is the next step in that process. Let's take a look at what you have.</p>

          <p>Hmm, interesting. This wood is nothing like I've ever seen. And this craftsmanship!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I'll let the crafting masters continue the examination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you'll return the next time we need Rangers slain. In the meantime, please accept this payment.</p>

          <p>Sorus said the Vasharti Rangers are one of the most brutal forces at Rentus Base. You were asked to slay them and take their Balaur Bows.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and the Balaur Bows were quickly taken to be examined by experts for any special qualities.</p>
