          <p>Ah... a wandering soul, so full of dark vigor, comes to a rotting Drakan, trapped in the same cell that has ended so many others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You stand before the great prophet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bhasha]. Who foretold the Dragon Lord [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA52]'s downfall, and for his temerity in suggesting that her immortality was not guaranteed, was silenced and sent here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worse, the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30706a] took my book of prophecies. What is a prophet without prophecies, or a knight without a quest? My book is what gives me reason, Daeva. I need it back.</p>

          <p>Vhasha's book! He and I share the gift of foresight, I see... everything that was written here has come to fruition. A force like this working alongside Asmodian steel would be something to reckon with, no?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. We should act on this, my student. Opportunities to forge friendships with the likes of Vhasha are not common....</p>

          <p>You met the Balaur prophet Vhasha, who once foretold of Tiamat's death, and was thrown into prison for the "crime". He asked you to retrieve his book of prophecies from the Drakan Thieves that had tormented him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You managed to find the book, and took it to Munin to look over. He was amazed at the accuracy of the prophecies, and rewarded you for your find.</p>
