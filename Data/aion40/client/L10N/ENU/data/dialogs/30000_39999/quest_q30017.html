          <p>[%username], [%username], stop right there! That sword you're carrying...is that Siel's Supreme Greatsword? I recognize its hilt.</p>

          <p>Oh, she's a beauty. Haven't seen one of them in years.... Where'd you manage to find it? Or, knowing you, I should say, who'd you manage to take it from?</p>

          <p>It's a real shame, though...having a nice weapon like that and letting it get all scratched up. Real shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't get me wrong, I've seen Siel's Supreme Greatsword before...just none so smashed up as yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet if you had that restored, it could slice the throat of an Asmodian without him even feeling it. He'd take a swallow, and it'd run all down his neck and chest. It just so happens that I know a Reian fella that could fix it up real nice for you....</p>

          <p>Like I said, I know a Reian fella in Soteria Sanctuary that can work wonders on a sword like that. Goes by the name [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefeios], and he's got a mother's touch.</p>

          <p>Sure, maybe I do get a little cut of the action for sending Daevas his way...but that's just commerce. You polish my sword, I'll polish yours, am I right?</p>

          <p>It's a relic, Daeva. An antique. They sure don't make them like this anymore. Just leave it to me, Daeva. I'll get it fixed up in no time.</p>
