          <p>We don't have time to celebrate! The last dredgion is heading to us now. If it were to reach us, in this condition...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I need you to invade the dredgion before it gets here and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_03_DrakanWi_Boss_Ah]. With him dead, and with the rest of the dredgion fleet discovered, we won't have to worry about aerial bombardments for quite some time.</p>
          <p> </p>
	  			<p>Will you help? [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hejitor] will want to speak to you if you succeed.</p>

          <p>I would encourage you, but at this point you're just making the rest of us look bad.</p>

          <p>Then you got to the dredgion in time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remarkable, [%username]. Without you, without everything you've done since your ascension, so many thousands would be dead. This may not be the last of the dredgions, as we had assumed, but the milestone cannot be ignored. We are safe, at least for a little while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is your reward. Take it with my most sincere thanks. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>You assaulted the dredgion and killed Captain Anusa before reporting to Jerot. However, he warned you that there were more dredgions that needed to be destroyed.</p>
