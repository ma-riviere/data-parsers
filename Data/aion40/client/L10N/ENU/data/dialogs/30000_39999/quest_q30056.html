          <p>The Stone of Restoration! I've been after it for so long I hadn't taken the time to figure out what I'd do when I got it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're supposed to have ended our official attempts to free Dirvisia. If I leave my post to do it I'll get chewed out by my superiors, and how can I welcome Dirvisia back if I can't hold my head up among the Guardians?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've been so helpful, [%username]. Would you mind one more task?</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Underpass_LiStatue_Q30056] is just inside the entrance to Silentera Canyon. You'll recognize her--there's only one statue of a beautiful woman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That Stone of Restoration should be easy enough to use. Just, I don't know, rub it... or say "hey presto". You know? Even Telemachus could figure it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and watch out for batties, of course--Silentera is overrun with them. Batties. You know, Asmodians?</p>

          <p>I'd tell him in person, but things are strained between us now. I must return to the fortress and let Gellius know I'm safe.</p>

          <p>I must apologize for my words to you before. Gellius and I have been rivals for so long that it clouds my judgment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We trained together back before the Cataclysm, but Gellius didn't like being bested by someone younger than himself. He quarreled with me and harassed me every chance he got.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I became involved with Dirvisia, his jealousy got the better of him. He was determined to have her, no matter the cost. I don't think he even cared for her at first. Perhaps he came to love her? I hope so.</p>

          <p>Dirvisia...is she free now, and back in the arms of her husband?</p>

          <p>I thought I had put those things behind me. After all, we are talking about something that happened before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But hearing Dirvisia's name once again, I realize I had only buried it. From this letter, it sounds as if she hasn't completely forgotten what happened, either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She thinks she has done me wrong. If only she would listen to her own advice....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In any case, I am glad I could help Dirvisia. Now I can forget her and the past, and start focusing on the present.</p>
