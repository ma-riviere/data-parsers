          <p>On the war front, there are many things you just have to deal with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, I'm a Daeva of Herbs, but I can't research here comfortably at all. So I'm put to work on other tasks in my down time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm really hoping that this pays off, helping Archons and administration officers....</p>

          <p>It is. That's why I volunteered to help with coin missions, which are a bit more interesting to think about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, the fortress is researching the Jotuns with great interest these days. They regularly send Archons to the Lower Udas Temple. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, I heard they spend more time battling than doing research! It's dangerous down there. Can you help, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Great! The mission is to get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDTemple_RollingWheel_53_Ae]s. Their sawteeth are quite sharp and deadly, and needless to say, they are disrupting the research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If their numbers are diminished even a little, it'll be easier for Archons to carry out their work down there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you can do it, [%username]. Just watch out for their teeth!</p>

          <p>What a shame. I thought you'd definitely say yes, [%username]. I guess maybe you don't crave excitement as much as I do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess I'll look around for someone with more time. Or maybe I'll do it myself. That would be exciting, wouldn't it?</p>

          <p>I'm so busy these days. New poisons, injured people... not to mention the work involved in managing these coin missions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without the coin work, I wouldn't be this busy. But I'm not selfish enough to ditch it.... And like I said before, it's interesting, at least.</p>

          <p>Take this Mithril coin, like I promised.</p>
