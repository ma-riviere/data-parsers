          <p>I've been examining the Quartz Rod. It emanates magical power, but only very weakly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That may be the key. If the Rod really powers the Rift Orb, it should contain much more energy than it does now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My theory is that the Quartz Rod itself is also low on energy.</p>

          <p>As the Rod is a power source, it'll need a massive infusion of energy, preferably from something native to Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever seen a Wraithling? It resembles nothing so much as a flying humanoid tree.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are filled with magical energy. I can think of no better source for our purposes. Can you hunt some down for me?</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Vampire_DR_54_An]s near the Dragonrest are particularly powerful. You should start with them.</p>

          <p>Stormwing is a power even a Dragon Lord couldn't kill--only seal away. It may soon get loose and destroy everything in a rampage of revenge.</p>

          <p>Herka theorized that the Rift Orb didn't function because the Quartz Rod was itself low on power. She thought Mystical Roots might have the energy necessary to recharge it.</p>
