          <p>My fellow members of the Alabaster Order,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We recently received a special request from Priest Iorene, who works on an excavation project at Vaizel's Peak. He asks that we kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ettin_31_An]s that are stealing and destroying excavated relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All members of the Alabaster Order are asked to eliminate Cracktooth Ettins and report their success to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_35007] before any more damage is done.</p>

          <p>Ah, Heiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Filled with ruins, Krall, Lepharist Revolutionaries and crazy Archons--we have more chances to fight for Elyos safety here than in the Abyss! Well, sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, how was the mission?</p>

          <p>Just what I expected from a battle-ready Daeva like you, [%username]. Good work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though, I think the Lepharist Revolutionaries are more dangerous than Cracktooth Ettins. Did you see any of them while you were up on Vaizel's Peak? No? Eh....</p>

          <p>You did as requested and reported to Aiskyholos in Heiron, who seemed more concerned about the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>
