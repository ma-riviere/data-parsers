          <p>Thanks to you we have Tipolid Hip meat for the villagers, but I'm worried about old Margarro. He's doing poorly. The Tipolid hip meat is too tough for Margarro--he's practically toothless.</p>

          <p>[%username]. Will you do something, not for me but for Margarro?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He can eat fish even if he doesn't have teeth. The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_n_c_30a] in the brook are good for restoring energy and so tender a baby could eat them.</p>

          <p>Sure. It'll be a nice break from all that fighting, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Perhaps if I help Margarro, it'll get Centurion Asclepius off my back. That centurion is always fussing about one blasted thing after another! I'm doing my best not to cause any problems.</p>

          <p>I'll use one to make a broth for Margarro. If it helps him recover, he may be able to eat something more substantial.</p>
