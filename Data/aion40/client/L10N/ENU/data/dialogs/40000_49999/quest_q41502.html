          <p>There's only one place that I know of that has gemstones like these, [%username], and that's the Heart of Fissure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've devised a test for you to carry out. I want you to take one of the gemstones you collected and return it to a [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S11].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you're there, you need to use the magical power I've put into the stone, then just... see what happens!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Small Craters and the Heart of Fissure ARE connected, you should see some kind of reaction from the stone. If they're not, you can just head back here and we'll figure out our next course of action. Deal?</p>

          <p>TELEPORTED? Then they are connected!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The consequences are profound, [%username]. Think about it: a network of cells, connected by this strange power. Perhaps we've uncovered the source of Tiamat's power! This could turn the tide of our war!</p>

          <p>Grido had an experiment for you. He asked you to take a refined gemstone back to a Small Crater, then try using magic on it to see what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did, and were instantly transported to the Giant Crater before being sent to the Heart of Fissure. After finally making your way back to Grido, you reported to him, much to his excitement.</p>
