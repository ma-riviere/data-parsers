          <p>Though we're on the very doorstep of the Belaur, I'm terribly fond of the Edendell. So much beauty, so much wonder. It inspires my magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But those... shattering [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Unicorn_58_An]s keep trampling my herb garden! I just wanna wring their necks....</p>

          <p>You look like a capable [%userclass]. Would you take care of them for me?</p>

          <p>Now, what did I do with my Marble? I'll ask the Rotron if he saw it. Oh, no time for that--there's so many other things that need to get done today.</p>

          <p>Oh my, those nasty Zefiruns! Did you know they were trampling my garden? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was going to ask someone to take care of it for me, but it seems they've dispersed on their own. Perhaps they found some other garden to trample. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I can sleep better at night, knowing my herbs are safe. Was there something I can help you with, or did you just what to chat about herbs?</p>

          <p>The Whitemist Zefiruns in the Edendell had been giving Kiriyu a hard time. They were constantly trampling his herbs, which he needed for magic.</p>
