          <p>[%username]! I had hoped I wouldn't have to drag you into yet another of my problems. But we simply have no one available of your skill in the legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm ashamed, but for the sake of peace, I must ask you another favor. The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41118a] have taken countless lives. Please, take care of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Owllau_El_57_Nmd_Ah] of the Urugugu Tribe, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_CalydonPr_57_Nmd_Ah] of the Humnaz Tribe, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Raidmonster_58_Al] of the Sand Bug Tribe. Pacifying any one of them would prevent a great number of casualties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are nothing like you've dealt with before. You'll need to take many colleagues with you, this time.</p>

          <p>You're back! I know how good you are, [%username], but this mission involves the most powerful of foes, so I can't help worrying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Notorious Shadow Targets are so named for very good reasons, as I'm sure you can now attest.</p>

          <p>Well then? Don't keep me waiting--I'm dying to know! Which one did you deal with?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>They were all most formidable enemies. You gathered many colleagues to face them, and after a tough battle, you got rid of one.</p>
