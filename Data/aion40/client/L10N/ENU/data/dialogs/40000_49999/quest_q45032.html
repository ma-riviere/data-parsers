          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Field Wardens operate across all Asmodae, even in the most barren of environments. Our support of the people in these areas is particularly crucial, as they often feel they have no one else to look to for protection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aside from shelter--which they already have--the primary need of the people is food. In a brutal environment such as Beluslan, gathering food can be difficult, and so we have decided to assist in this task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When possible, please do your part to gather food for the people of Beluslan. Many have requested [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_a], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_b], and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_c] in particular. Deliver anything you can find to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Columba], who will be handling our redistribution effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blood for blood.</p>

          <p>It's been a while since I talked to any other Wardens. I haven't the foggiest why those who were so passionate before no longer show up. Maybe they've joined another faction?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moot point, I suppose. What matters is that those of us who are still dedicated to the success of the Field Wardens do our part, no matter how menial the task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe you were one of those asked to gather food for the people of Beluslan? How did that go?</p>

          <p>We need to make time, [%username]. Who will we protect if the people of Asmodae starve to death? The Mau? Perhaps qooqoos?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please do this for us, and for the people. Remember, they've requested [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_a], [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_b], and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45032_c].</p>

          <p>We need to make time, [%username]. And I can see that you've made good use of yours. Rogen, Brommel, Jardine...you've brought exactly what the people have requested.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll see to it that these food supplies are distributed to the most needy, and that they know it was the Field Wardens--and no one else--who aided them. If we support them, surely they will support us when...ever we need them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And as for you.... Here's that token you're no doubt expecting.</p>
