          <p>Ah, [%userrace]. I was wondering if you could embark on a brief mission for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A patrol spotted an [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4B_FOBJ_T3_Wagon] south of the Steam Springs. No civilians should be in the area, and none have been reported missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone is doing something there, and we have no idea who or what. I need you to investigate. It could be nothing, but we need to know either way.</p>

          <p>That was quick. But I'd expect nothing less of a Daeva of your capabilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Report. What did you discover about the wagon?</p>

          <p>The Dragonbound?! These are grave tidings indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where you find a few Dragonbound, there are always more. They must have a village or base in the Steam Springs area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must report to my superiors immediately. Thank you for your intelligence.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>When you did, you encountered the Dragonbound. After defeating them, you reported to Sirio, who found their presence shocking and troubling.</p>
