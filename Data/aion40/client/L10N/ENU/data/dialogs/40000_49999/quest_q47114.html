          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. You're just in time. The Oracles have sent us another of their visions.</p>

          <p>They see the Mau in Mist Mane Village planning a major assault. This jives with information I've gotten from patrols in the area.</p>

          <p>That's where you come in. You need to become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_35_45](s) and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q48607]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should put a hurt on any plans they have to attack the fortress. Are you up to it?</p>

          <p>Good. Remember your role in this: to be a guide that leads younger Daevas on the path to greatness.</p>

          <p>In a sense, killing Mau is secondary. But not really. Be sure to take care of them.</p>
