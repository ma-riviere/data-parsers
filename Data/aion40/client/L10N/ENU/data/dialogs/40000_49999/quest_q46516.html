          <p>An explorer named Quinn has hired us to kill the sandshark Zantra.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: This vicious sandshark is a perfect eating machine responsible for many "accidents" befalling desert nomads. It has retreated to the Dragonrest to evade hunters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Client has provided [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FOBJ_Q46516] as bait. Rewards given to the Daemon who hunts down this elusive creature.</p>

          <p>Sandshark! Yiii! I hate sharks! Bad enough in water, but on land too? You are going to need a bigger weapon, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it just jumps out at you from under ground? That is no good, no good at all! I did not know anything like that lived! Maybe Daeva stories not so good sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You caught and killed it, right, Daeva? Please tell me so! Little Shugo heart cannot take much more!</p>
