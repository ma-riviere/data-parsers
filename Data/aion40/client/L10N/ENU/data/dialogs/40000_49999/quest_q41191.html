          <p>(This Drenite is badly cracked, but as far as you can tell, it's still quite hard.)</p>

          <p>(It's definitely still usable. You consider bringing it back to your home city, but perhaps, the Reians could use it more.)</p>

          <p>No, no! The archway goes there! THERE! I swear, [%userrace], there's no work ethic in this new generation of laborers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like trying to build with bent nails and warped wood. You can get it done, but it takes much more time, and the results are inferior.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are just so many factors involved in creating a great structure that it's a wonder I get anything done!</p>

           <p>Exactly! Say, let me see those... hmmm... yes... I think... Oh!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even this small amount can be put to good use. I could make a hundred special Drenite nails or a thousand meters of filigree....</p>

          <p>Where did you get... oh, it's immaterial. Just keep me in mind if you find any more, will you?</p>
