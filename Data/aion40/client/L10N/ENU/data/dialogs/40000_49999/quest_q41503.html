          <p>Now for the fun stuff, [%username]! You get to plant a bomb! An Aether Bomb, to be precise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've established that several locations are connected, but now we must see if we can sever that connection and if Tiamat is weakened by the loss of connection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, want to do the fun part? All you have to do is plant this bomb inside the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4B_FOBJ_CrackPortal], detonate it, and report the results back to me. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Ugh. I didn't think it would destroy the crater, but there was no response at all?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. I'll have to come up with a different plan. Accomplishments are never easily gained, my friend!</p>

          <p>After finding out that the Craters were linked to each other, along with the Heart of Fissure, Grido wanted to try severing the connection, hoping that it would weaken Tiamat's power and turn the tide of the war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You traveled to the Giant Crater with an Aether Bomb. However, after detonating it, you noted no change, and returned to Grido with the bad news.</p>
