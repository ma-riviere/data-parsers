          <p>This is an Aether sounding device. It's complicated, but basically, the device reads temperament. We've used them as proximity sensors for years, to alert us when Sapiens or Balaur were approaching our camps.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This particular egg gets the mildest reading from the sounding device. That means the Pagati in there, almost ready to hatch, will be one of the more compliant youngsters of the litter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to build a bond with that little egg, [%username]. You're going to imitate some mother Pagati behavior with the egg in your cube--hopefully that will do it. The Rakeclaw Pagati tend to feast on the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_SandShark_58_An] while they're carrying eggs, so go kill some Zanthays. And try to think Pagati thoughts while you do it.</p>

          <p>A couple of these eggs set the Aether sounding device off the charts. I might go put those back...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did it go, [%username]? Is the egg okay? You kept it warm in your cube, right?</p>

          <p>Let me check it. It feels a little cool--no, that's okay, Pagati temperatures vary throughout the day. We'll just pop it back in the incubator and it'll be fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see... the sounding device readings are minimal. Less than before, even.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait... it's moving! The egg! It's--it's hatching!</p>

          <p>Vesetia's theory claimed that Pagati bonding began before the animal even hatched, so she sent you out to bond with an egg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You felt a little strange, running around killing Rockblade Zanthay and "thinking Pagati thoughts," but Vesetia seemed pleased with the results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you were discussing your success, the egg began to hatch.</p>
