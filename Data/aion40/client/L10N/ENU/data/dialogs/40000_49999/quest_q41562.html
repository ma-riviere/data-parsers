          <p>I have another small task that is perhaps worthy of a Trust Marble. Some researchers I know need some experimental samples from local enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Brohum Village and collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41562a]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q41562_All] there. Then, go to Sabat's End Cemetery and get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41562b]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Fi_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Wi_58_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not know what the researchers need them for, and I do not particularly care. Nor should you. Your goal is clear; the rest is secondary.</p>

          <p>I suppose I should thank you; you saved me the bother and expense of hiring Daevas or buying what was requested of me from mercenaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But not yet--not before the task is done. Are you sure you did everything required of you?</p>

          <p>Hmmm. These certainly look like the right items.... but I shall have to test them, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well! They're real, and all here! Hmm. A pleasant surprise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I promised you a Marble of Truth, and here it is. Still, if you want that Magical Aether Crystal, your tasks are not yet complete.</p>

          <p>Lumen needed some items from local enemies for research purposes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you battled Brohums and gained Vine Weapons, and slew restless Reian Spirits for Crystals of Light. When you returned with the spoils, Lumen reluctantly gave you a Trust Marble.</p>
