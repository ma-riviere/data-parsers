          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of our allies in Gelkmaros has asked us to supply them with weapons to assist in an effort that is of mutual benefit to both parties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have specifically been asked to gather [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047b]. Please collect these materials and bring them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Amphibia] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mollusca], who will see that they are passed on to the proper contacts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Gelkmaros is full of enemies--not just the Balaur, either. There are hidden enemies all around, and we must be prepared to fight at all times to defend our position here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, there are also hidden allies to assist us...so long as we are able to help them in return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe you were asked to assist in this effort? [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047b] were to be gathered to make weapons, as I recall.</p>

          <p>All Wardens in Gelkmaros were specifically asked to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_G_QUEST_45047b]. If we do not meet our quota there is no telling what might happen.</p>

          <p>But that's for neither of us to worry about. Here is your reward--I'll take things from here.</p>
