          <p>Have you seen the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_padigishu]s out in the Wastes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a saying in an ancient Reian language that translates roughly to "the hands of the giants crush Daevas' fates." Basically, there's a long-standing belief that these creatures are ill omens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Bighands_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Bighands_R_58_An]s are quite powerful, but I've never seen any evidence that they crush anything more than bones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's bad enough, though, so could you eliminate some of the creatures in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2]?</p>

          <p>There's probably something to the Reian fears of the Tyrhunds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They do look very similar to the hands of the fabled Petralith that used to exist in these Wastes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That Petralith is no legend--we've found solid first-hand accounts of its building. The fists of that giant creature would have been formidable, even to Aion's allies.</p>

          <p>Ah, excellent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be fascinating to study the Tyrhund's origins. Perhaps there are records of them in the Jotun Research Library back in Kamar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. I'll make myself a note to look into that.</p>

          <p>Hatiel, a Jotun Researcher, told you about the legends of Tyrhunds bringing bad luck to those who see them. He asked you to eliminate some of them, not because of the bad omens they bring, but because of the physical danger they pose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You cleared out some Tyrhunds, and Hatiel thanked you for your work.</p>
