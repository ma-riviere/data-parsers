        <body>
          <p>If you're going to stay in Kamar for a while, you could probably use some friends here, eh? Daevas are only as good as the company they keep, that's what I believe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, let's see... [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gachuia], the Potion Supply Merchant... she'll be helpful to a [%userclass] like yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mirdinia], the Special Crafting Merchant--she's a sweetheart. And perhaps [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Iskadar], the Sandstorm Weapon Steward, might be of help to you. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd meet 'em all if I were you. I trust them to deal fairly, [%username], and so can you.</p>

          <p>Oh, you're [%username]? I've heard your name from Ulstia. How exciting to meet a famous foreign Daeva like you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Me, I'm just a humble potions merchant. I've never even gone further than the Kamar Outskirts--can you believe it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I'm better at patching people up after a fight than fighting, myself. But if you ever need a potion, then I'm your girl, [%username]!</p>

          <p>Did you ask him about his buildings? Ha ha, that's the key, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's what keeps bringing him back into my shop. He'll befriend anyone who's willing to listen to him talk about his work!</p>

          <p>Solomon? Huh. He sends all sorts of people over here, and I'm never quite sure why.</p>

          <p>Well, foreigner, I'll trade with you if you have Kahrun's Symbol, but I'm not interested in conversation.</p>
