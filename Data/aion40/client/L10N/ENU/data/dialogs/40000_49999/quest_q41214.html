          <p>Please listen for a moment, [%username]. My father's story isn't over yet. I've read more into his journal--listen to this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"It exists! This device is real, but how? And whose technology? I shook off the Grave Robbers, but only to uncover a shadowy group, the Nightshade Clan, who appear to be closer to this relic."</p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe... he's still alive. I know he probably isn't, but... Maybe by following my father's clues, I can find out what's actually going on, and, even if he is dead, get some sense of closure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help? Will you find the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_05] and kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackRa_57_An]s there?</p>

          <p>The Nightshade Clan have been exploiting the lands around here for years, [%username]. They loot sacred places clumsily and recklessly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ruins nearby were once filled with all manner of invaluable art and artifacts. Then the Nightshade Clan came, and now it's all little more than a skeletal husk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ridding Sarpan of the Nightshade Clan doesn't just help me, you see. We're doing the world a favor.</p>

          <p>As am I, my friend. Now, let's look at this journal again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everything's written in code from this point, presumably because my father feared his findings being discovered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can decipher his entries, but it'll take some time, I'm afraid.</p>

          <p>Luanna, after reading her father's journal, found that a group named the Nightshade Clan had played a central part in her father's death. She sent you to fight them in the hope of uncovering information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned victorious, but without any information that could help. However, Luanna decided to decode more of her father's journal.</p>
