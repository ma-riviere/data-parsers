          <p>I can't believe my first assignment is so important! I'm nervous, of course, but excited as well!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really want to do a good job, but my soldiers are having a difficult time of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's mostly because of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_MutantBeast_59_An]es. You'd think they were working directly for the Balaur the way they attack!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really want to make a good impression with Kahrun. If you could kill some of those nasties, we'd all benefit! What do you say?</p>

          <p>Magnas doesn't like me. I don't know why. I look up to him so much! He has so much experience!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've tried to get him to like me, even giving him the really important duties, but he still doesn't like me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, well, I'll worry about it later. I guess you're reporting in to me?</p>

          <p>Yippee! That's great to hear! Now my Outriders won't be so tired all the time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should really step up patrols, though. We have a lot of ground to cover, and the Balaur are getting restless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, it was so sweet of you to give me a hand! Please stop by again to say hello!</p>

          <p>You winnowed their numbers, much to her gratitude. You're still not sure whether she's competent or not, though.</p>
