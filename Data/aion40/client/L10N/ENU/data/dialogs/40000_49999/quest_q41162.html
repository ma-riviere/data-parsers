          <p>Now that you have the bait, that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_SalivadoRedQ_57_Ae] will show itself! I'm certain of it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My sources say it's been spotted near the [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_Decoy_Q41162] in the south of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1]. That's where I suggest you plant the bait.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be wary, though; I have no idea how the Redscale Hornskull will act when confronted. Such mutants are very rare, no matter what the realm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When--not if--you succeed, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bargeni]. Best of luck to you, [%userclass]!</p>

          <p>Good riddance to bad rubbish. Now the normal Hornskulls should be easy enough to rout.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll have the researchers watch out for any more mutants, to make sure this never happens again.</p>

          <p>Valuable resources were saved thanks to you. I'll be sure your people know what a great service you've completed on our behalf.</p>

          <p>As he instructed, you found the Smooth Boulder and put the bait on it. Soon enough, the mutant appeared. You eliminated it, and reported to a grateful Tribunus Varzeni.</p>
