          <p>Dispatches and pleas for aid keep coming in from all across Balaurea. I suppose that makes sense; Balaurea was basically made to cause Daevas problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm. This one is from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sirio] at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_S1]. Seems fairly urgent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're looking for a way to do some good, [%username], you may want to consider taking this one up.</p>

          <p>Ah, finally Zas answers my request. I understand he's busy, but he needs to learn to prioritize.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The reason I called for aid is that I've been in close contact with the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_S2]. Their work could greatly impact this outpost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Right now, they are in need of help. Go there and talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Viaus]. Do whatever he requires of you.</p>

          <p>Ah, hello! You know, I've always thought Daevas made the best researchers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're long-lived, and can go places others can't. Say, do you mind dying once or twice to get into particularly dangerous areas?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just once, mind you; I'd set up the Obelisk and pay the Soul Healer....</p>

          <p>Mmm, pity. I always get that answer. Just no intellectual curiosity these days!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there's plenty of other interesting phenomena to investigate, and they don't involve mortal peril... I don't think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, what am I worried about? I'm sure you can handle whatever may come your way. Welcome aboard.</p>

          <p>Zas got a request for help from the Cindercone Outpost and asked you to meet Sirio.</p>

          <p>Sirio in turn asked you to go to the Volcanic Research Expedition to aid in research there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went and talked with Viaus, who said he definitely needed your help.</p>
