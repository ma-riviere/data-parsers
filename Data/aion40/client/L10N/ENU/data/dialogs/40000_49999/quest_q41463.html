        	<p>So, [%username], you want to make a Luminasiel weapon, do you? Well, the first step in the process is to acquire [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41463a].</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>This won't be easy. These petals contain a bit of the very essence of Lady Siel, and were scattered everywhere during the Cataclysm.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>If you really are serious about this, go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ekios]. He'll tell you more.</p>

          <p>A Luminasiel weapon? I think that's rather hasty of you. But since Kahrun sent you to me, I suppose that I should at least get you started.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Siel's Petals are practically impossible to find in the wild. You'll need this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41463_poty].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take good care of it, it's very rare. Come back to me when you manage to get seven Siel's Petals from it.</p>

          <p>Oh, hello again. Have you been taking good care of the Siel's Petal Hearthbloom I gave you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you've at least managed to get one or two petals from it. Please tell me that I didn't waste that precious Hearthbloom on a clumsly, brown-thumbed Daeva.</p>

          <p>You! You actually did it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no question, these are actual Siel's Petals! Forgive me - I've just seen far too many Daevas get a new hearthbloom, only to let it wither for lack of care. I'll deliver these to Siel's Temple myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should probably go back to Kahrun and find out what other materials you need.</p>

          <p>Kahrun told you that Siel's Petals are the most important component to craft a Luminasiel weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ekios gave you a Siel's Petal Hearthbloom and told you to take good care of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You took good care of the Hearthbloom and were able to gather enough of Siel's Petals to bring back to Ekios.</p>
