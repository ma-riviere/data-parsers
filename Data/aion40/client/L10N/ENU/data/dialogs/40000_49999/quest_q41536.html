          <p>We're certainly not getting anywhere very fast. We really need more information if we want to find the more important relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Within the Siel's Temple Ruins, there are monuments built by the ancestors. Each has various images and glyphs carved into the stone. I think these may be records, leading us to the relics of Lady Siel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could really use your help on this. Can you go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T4_A2] and get rubbings of those monuments, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Look at this bowl we dug. It's beautiful. For all we know, it was used in ceremonies by Lady Siel herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've just uncovered some private chambers of the temple. They're likely filled with tons of artifacts!</p>

          <p>Hmmm? Oh, yes! The rubbings! You've got them, already? Wonderful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each monument depicts very different information. I'll need to study them each carefully, referencing with what we already know and diligently copying everything for our records.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And with a little luck, they may detail where Lady Siel's relics are hiding. Thank you, [%username]!</p>
