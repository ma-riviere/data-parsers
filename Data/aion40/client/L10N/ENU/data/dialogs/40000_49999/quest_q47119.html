          <p>One look at how the Balaur treat their so-called "allies" tells you everything you need to know about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Hoarfrost Mau. They were loyal worshippers and warriors, but did the Balaur care about them? Not at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now the Hoarfrost are this close to a formal alliance with us. The Oracles have seen a way nudge them a little closer.</p>

          <p>You and others, at least. Your first step is to become [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] to any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_35_45b](s), then take them to Bakarma Barracks and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q48719]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of it as a demonstration of our goodwill and a chance to take down Balaur at the same time.</p>

          <p>Ahhh, that's good to hear. Once the Hoarfrost ally with us, there'll be one more resource for local Daevas.</p>
