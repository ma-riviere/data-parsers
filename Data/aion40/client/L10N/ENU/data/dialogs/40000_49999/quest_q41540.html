          <p>As you likely already know, [%userrace], many of my ancestors were petrified by Tiamat's curse. It is for them that we must fight on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In both body and soul, they are trapped. If someone would use the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41540a] near the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_CrystalYun], however, the Aether energy there should be reinforced. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Kahrun's Eyes, this could free our ancestors' souls from their eternal prisons.</p>

          <p>Do you think a soul can feel anguish, [%username]? Do you think they're aware of their prison?</p>

          <p>What happened with the Powerful Aether Marble? Did it prove successful?</p>

          <p>It may look as if nothing happened, but you have increased the power of Aether in the area. Tiamat's curse will slowly unravel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we keep up the process--building the power up over time--those lost Reians might soar on the winds one last time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Kahrun watch over you, friend. We've got a long way to go. May we stop Tiamat before somethng like this can happen again.</p>

          <p>Materia said the Frozen Reian Tribe was cursed by Tiamat long ago, trapping their souls for eternity. They need to be saved.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She suggested that the Powerful Aether Marble should intensify the energy of Aether in the area, releasing the souls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You used the Powerful Aether Marble near the Frozen Reian Tribe in the Siel's Temple Ruins to strengthen the energy of Aether.</p>
