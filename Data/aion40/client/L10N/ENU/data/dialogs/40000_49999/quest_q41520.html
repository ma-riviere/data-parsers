          <p>Lada da di da... oh, hello! Am I expecting you? No, I don't think I was expecting anyone. Was I? No, I wasn't. Glad THAT'S settled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd hate for you to have come all this way for nothing, though. Did you happen to notice the Vortex at the edge of the garden over there? I'm sure it's connected to somewhere, like the Gravity Fault, maybe. But I've determined that only the Balaur can use it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So clearly, I need to transform into a Balaur in order to unlock the secret of the Vortex. All I need is to make a Marble of Transfiguration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you mind terribly defeating some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Guardian_58_An]s in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_A1] and bringing me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41520a]s you find? </p>

          <p>AHAH! I knew I was right. Showed you, didn't I? Oh, don't be a sore loser. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, hello. Say... have we met? I was just having a friendly wager with a Rotron about whether Murmurs would attack their own reflections or if...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, it's not important. How can I help you? </p>

        	<p>Amazing! How did you know I needed these? Quick, what color am I thinking of?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never mind. Now that I've got all the materials, I can start making the Marble of Transfiguration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm just about ready. I'd tell you what else I need, but you've surely already read my mind. Astounding, really!</p>

          <p>Kiriyu wants to unlock the secret of the Vortex in the Edendell. Assuming he doesn't forget all about it first, that is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He needed some materials to make the Marble of Transfiguration, so you removed some Mountains' Defenders and brought him Transfiguration Fragments.</p>
