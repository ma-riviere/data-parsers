        	<p>You know about the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In], right? Caused by Vanktrist Spacetwine, distorting space, all that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we learned that the collision was creating an integrated space, where pieces of Elysea and Asmodae overlapped. So we started to study it ourselves. If we could harness that power, we could have a strike force of Daevas sitting in Elysea at a moment's notice. Wouldn't that be worthwhile?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sala] and he'll explain to what your mission is.</p>

        	<p>I'm sure Rodul practically talked your wings off about the Dimensional Vortex, so I'll get straight to the point.</p>
       		<p> </p>
        	<p>We plan to open the Dimensional Vortex soon and begin a battle in Theobomos. But we need more soldiers first. Would you be willing to help us?</p>

        	<p>When the attack starts, we'll open the Dimensional Vortex. We're still testing it, so the number of Daevas we can send is limited. You'll need to hurry.</p>

        	<p>We aren't sure what this battle will be like, either. Please keep us informed of your experiences.</p>

          <p>Rodul said development of the Dimensional Vortex to link Asmodae to Elysea was successful. He wanted you to talk with Salla and find out when the attack will be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Salla said that Theobomos was chosen as first vortex battle. You were encouraged to join the attack, and bring your skill and leadership to the fight.</p>
