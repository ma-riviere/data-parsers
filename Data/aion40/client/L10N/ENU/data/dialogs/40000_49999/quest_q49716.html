          <p>We're headed to the East Wasteland Mine to volunteer.</p>

          <p>Kobold Diggers keep digging away in the mine without much thought. Now that the mine is about to collapse, the Kobold Diggers must be driven off. Complete this task and report the results to the South Katalam Branch of the Green Hat Unit.</p>

          <p>Those damned Silverines never do things correctly. This is reflected in their weakening of the ground around them due to their mining operation.</p>

          <p>I feel bad for the Kobolds, but you have to drive them off from there, nyerk.</p>

          <p>I have no idea why Silverines keep doing that. I'm embarrassed to call them my fellow Shugos.</p>
