          <p>All you needed to do was to pick up the steel that the Skurvs collected in their cart.</p>

          <p>Please give me what you've gathered, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Let's see. This is steel with negligible impurities, all right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Arrowheads made of this steel should draw in more customers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Skurv? No need to worry about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can press forward without several of them mining.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, many more Skurvs came by ferry today, from Morheim, nyerk.</p>
