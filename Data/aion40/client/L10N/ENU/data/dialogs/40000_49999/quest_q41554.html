          <p>As Kahrun knows, I'm always looking to expand the craft of smithing, so I was searching for new materials to forge weapons more powerful than usual. Something to really make the Balaur regret their very existence!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystals here really got my attention. They're incredibly strong and sharp, making them good candidates for some impressive weaponry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm testing the different types of crystals to find those most suitable, but the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Silika_59_Ae]s are making it difficult to make much progress. Can you help? Make sure to grab any [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41554a]s that they drop!</p>

          <p>[%username]! How are you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These crystals are SUCH a joy to work with. I'm making real progress, and I think I'll be able to make some truly stunning weapons with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm running low on my early crystal samples, though. Have you had any luck finding more?</p></body>

          <p>Great job, [%username]! You are truly gifted with that [%mainslotitem] of yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ha! I've drawn my own blood already! These crystals are certainly sharp, no? They are going to make a fine weapon indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for bringing me these. May your arm never tire!</p>

          <p>Shumaron told you about his hope to find new materials for making superior quality weapons. He tested a variety of crystals and needs more to keep up his work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After killing several Ancient Orkanimums, you took the Sharp Crystals you found to him, and he was very grateful.</p>
