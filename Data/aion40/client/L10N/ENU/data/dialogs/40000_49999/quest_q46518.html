          <p>Balder himself has hired us to assassinate Zausis, an elite Elyos Guardian.</p>

          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail!</p>

          <p> 2. Location: Inggison Angrief Ruins</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: He is an amazingly strong fighter who has been at the vanguard of many Elyos victories in the Abyss. He called Lord Azphel several unprintable names in the last battle. This was the last straw.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This job requires great courage and strength. Strike a grevious blow to the enemy in the heart of their territory!</p>
