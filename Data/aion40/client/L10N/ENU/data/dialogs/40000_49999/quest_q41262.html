          <p>The historical researchers are all in agreement. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41262A], if it exists, rests somewhere in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D] area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many legends surround its origins. Some speak of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel] Legion and its ability to settle in this barren environment with only a handful of members. Others talk of the mysterious warrior and his powers over Daevas and death. </p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>You really found it? I'd thought the whole thing was just a myth, but the historians insisted.</p>

          <p>We're in for it now. Every meal time, we're doomed to have our ears filled with the exploits of "the warrior."</p>

          <p>I hope this is a weapon, otherwise the war effort's just been set back by years.</p>

          <p>Sutton and his researcher colleagues are really into relics. You'd already found Lady Yustiel's when he sent you out to find Siel's Grail.</p>
