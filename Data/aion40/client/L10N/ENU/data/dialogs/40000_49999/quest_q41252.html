          <p>Damn the Balaur! Damn them! My husband was slain by those cowards without a moment's thought for the repercussions. I... I want them to pay!</p>

        	<p>[%username], head to the northeast of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_01] and you'll see [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_DrakanAs_noble_58_An]s stationed there. </p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>They were the ones who killed my husband. I want them dead. Crush their skulls into the dirt, and spit on their broken corpses!</p>

          <p>He was never one for art, my husband. Too set on his training, too involved in the war effort. He had the handwriting of a child, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would always tease him for it, and he would always just look back with that sheepish grin of his. But for him to create something like this--it must have taken months!</p>

          <p>Ah. It seems those wounds of mine weren't healed after all, eh? Haha... I mustn't cry.</p>

          <p>Moraitia pieced together the fragments you recovered, and found that her husband had carved an intricate carving of her. She instantly let her fury take over, and sent you out to kill the Balaur soldiers who had killed him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After succeeding, she regretted her rash actions, although she did seem glad that some justice was served.</p>
