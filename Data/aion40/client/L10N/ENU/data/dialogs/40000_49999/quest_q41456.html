          <p>Historically, those forced to undergo the Koligran were said to have lost the ten virtues of self and the ten virtues of hope, the values described by Lady Siel herself, and by which every Reian lives their life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those tasked with the Koligran were sent out from our homes, only allowed to return once these twenty virtues had been recovered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can grant you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_01], but to earn it you must destroy two great threats that we face on a daily basis: the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Yun_undead_Fi_57_An]s and the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Yun_undead_Wi_57_An]s near the Destroyed Guardian's Seal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now. You have much to do.</p>

          <p>Did you do as you were asked? Those poor cursed souls threaten us every day.</p>

          <p>Not only are they denied the Aether's embrace, our prophets have had visions of them overrunning our defenses; hence we needed them dealt with.</p>

          <p>And in doing so, you perhaps learnt a little more about our ways, friend. Though these trials may appear testing beyond your limits, know that they can be completed provided you have the required conviction.</p>

          <p>Congratulations. Here is your reward.</p>
