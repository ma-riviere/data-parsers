          <p>Tiamaranta is divided into four major realms influenced by Tiamat's power. It's a dark reflection of him writ into the land itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each realm is guarded by an Incarnation carefully created by the Dragon Lord himself: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Tiamat_Crack_Named_60_Af], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Tiamat_Gravity_Named_60_Af], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Tiamat_Rage_Named_60_Af], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Tiamat_Crystal_Named_60_Af].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So much of his power is invested in these Incarnations that the loss of even one could be a significant blow to him directly. You know what you must do.</p>

          <p>This is a major victory! Tiamat has been shaken--of that much I am certain!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the others wonder why I am so fascinated by the [%userrace] people. You all have incredible strength and determination!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will inform my superiors of this at once. Take a moment to bask in your hard-earned glory before returning to work.</p>
