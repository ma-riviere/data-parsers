          <p>I've been receiving reports of earthquakes across Sarpan. Have you noticed them, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, the Sandstorm Legion has already identified the source of the vibrations. Have known for some time, now. </p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLDF4A_Raid_SandWarm_Monarch_60_Al], the Great Worm and Master of the Underworld, is wriggling. That's what's causing the quakes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's such a monstrous beast that we tried to keep a lid on it, but the residents' anxieties are escalating. I don't think we can let this go on. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please take a team to Muada's Trencher and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLDF4A_Raid_SandWarm_Monarch_60_Al]. You'll be well compensated.</p>

          <p>Betios asked you to kill Empress Muada, the tyrant of the underworld, for she was causing terrible earthquakes across Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you took a team of powerful fighters to her nest and killed her. After hearing your report, Betios praised your efforts.</p>
