          <p>Well--ack!--this isn't going quite how I thought it would. Ow. Ow! Hey, let go of that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], these yearlings are far too wild. I'm going to--ow, stop biting!--going to release them again. But it's all right. I'd thought this might happen, and the plan now is to hatch Pagati eggs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go back up to the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Drakanstrider_wild_58_An] nesting site in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D_03]. You'll have to take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41302A]s from the Pagati mothers. They will not be happy about it, I'm afraid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ow, ow! Let go of my hair! Shards, it's got my earring! Ow, ow, ow, help me out here!</p>

          <p>I took those yearlings out past the cemetary and set them free again. You know what they did?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They just stood there, staring at me. All of them. Then they followed me halfway back to the Seal camp before they got distracted by a passing Zanthay and ran off after it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I've still got a lot to learn about Pagati. Let's hope the eggs are easier to figure out.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you!</p>

          <p>I have an incubator all set up for them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm eager to see whether they're born with teeth or not. There's not much research on Pagati hatchlings yet.</p>

          <p>You collected eggs from the Rakestride Pagati, who did not give them up willingly, and delivered them to Vesetia.</p>
