		<p>So, 12 tokens? You know, with a bit more patience you could earn higher grade supplies. Then again, sometimes lower grade supply boxes turn out to have better items. Luck of the draw.</p>

		<p>It's up to you, Warden. If you want Tier 1 Warden Supplies, hand over 12 tokens.</p>

	  <p>Impressive, [%username]--28 tokens is quite a lot of work. Whether you realize it or not, every single job advances the cause of the Field Wardens.</p>

		<p>Not everyone can appreciate our true purpose, but with continued dedication, it will all pay off some day.</p>

		<p>Wow, 60 tokens? [%username], I haven't seen this level of dedication in...many weeks. Most Wardens give in to temptation long before that, or drop out of the ranks. But you stuck it out. Truly impressive.</p>
