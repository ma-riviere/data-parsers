        	<p>Loyal Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Excessive amounts of Aether in certain areas of the atmosphere have caused concern among Observatory Protectors in recent days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Haste is crucial in determining whether or not these results are accurate, for they could mark the beginning of a dangerous Aetheric flux.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium's Research Center has provided us with Aetheric Field Scanners, which we have installed in key areas of Brusthonin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Zealous Wardens will move without delay to bring the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45015] Results to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45014].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion's blessing be with you.</p>

          <p>It's a shame that most Asmodians will never appreciate the efforts of the Field Wardens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, there are some things it doesn't pay to share with the public. If they can't do anything about it, why cause a panic? That's why we must act in secrecy, until we are certain that it is time to...act.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you know all this by now, [%username]. No doubt you have some other purpose in bothering me?</p>

          <p>Please locate an Aetheric Field Scanner here in Brusthonin, and then hurry back. People are watching and it is important that they know we are keeping them safe. Considering the movements of my superiors, this may very well be a serious matter.</p>
