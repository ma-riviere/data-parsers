          <p>We don't have time to chitchat, now. We'll be in big trouble unless we regain control over those Petrahulks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, actually, I'll be the one in trouble. But my experiment was actually quite simple! I used a Glowing Marble to power some enchantments, but I don't think that one Marble was enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, it probably didn't help that I forgot some of the words in the incantation, either. But if I'm going to make this right, I'll need 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41201A]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_ElementalLightM_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_ElementalLightF_57_An]s in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1]. Will you help me again?</p>

          <p>I'm breaking a sweat just thinking of those Petrahulks running around like headless chickens.</p>

          <p>No, no, don't worry. I can definitely fix it.</p>

          <p>Did you get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41201A]s?</p>

          <p>Oh, I've learned my lesson. I'm going to double check the incantation now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that I have the Glowing Marbles, I can return the Petrahulks to their previous state. I guess it will only work if I perform the whole experiment... backwards?</p>

          <p>Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
