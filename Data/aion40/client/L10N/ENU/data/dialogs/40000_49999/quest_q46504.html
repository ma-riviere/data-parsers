          <p>We have been hired to kill Rokbak, a particularly large Bosbear.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: Biologists suspect that Rokbak has been mutated by exposure to aether. They fear that if he continues to grow, he may develop intelligence, and become even more dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FOBJ_Q46504] has been set up to lure Rokbak. Take the opportunity to strike, and report back once he is defeated.</p>

          <p>A smart huge Bosbear.... Just thinking about it makes my fur stand on end, nyerk!</p>

          <p>But the bigger they are, the better the story when they are taken down! Did you do it, Daeva? Did you??</p>
