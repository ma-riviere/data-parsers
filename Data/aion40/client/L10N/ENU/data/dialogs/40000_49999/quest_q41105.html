          <p>Whoa, did you feel that? The tremor under our feet? That's not Tiamat causing those rumblings. It's Klaws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've been multiplying, digging out new burrows underground. They've already caused trouble in the dungeons, and if they keep this up they could undermine the very foundation of the city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_OP_Neut_Queen_Nmd_55_An] rules this particular brood. If she died, there would be no one to lay more Klaw eggs. The entire hive would die out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their nest is in the Mephitic Caverns. Kill the queen before it's too late for us all.</p>

          <p>To be frank, Klaws give me the cold chills. Any enemy that multiplies that quickly is worthy of loathing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The researchers say the city foundation is still stable, but that's only for now. Queen Klawtara's death would be a load off my mind.</p>

          <p>Ah, finally. No more of those ominous tremors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll let some time pass for the Klaw numbers to subside. Then I'll send in Sandstorm Legionaries to sweep out the rest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that you may very well have saved the entire city in one stroke. Siel bless you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Baia was concerned about the hive of Sarpan Klaws digging out warrens under Kamar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did a favor for her by slaying Queen Klawtara, the only egg-laying Klaw in the area, so the rest of the swarm would die out.</p>
