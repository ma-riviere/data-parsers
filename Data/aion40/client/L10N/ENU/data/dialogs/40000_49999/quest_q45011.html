          <p>Everyone knows the Field Wardens are devoted to protecting Atreia's Aetheric Field.</p>

          <p>Ah. Apologies. We must delay action here in Beluslan. Neither time nor space are with us. I think the Elyos discovered our plan.</p>

          <p>No, don't ask me what that means. I will personally deliver a detailed message later, when I am able. For now, just tell that to a Warden here in Beluslan.</p>
