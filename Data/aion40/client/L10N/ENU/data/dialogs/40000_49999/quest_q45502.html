          <p>From: The Blood Crusade</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The Blood Crusade has confirmed that a contingent of the Elyos army is threatening Asmodians in Reshanta. The force is small, but appears all over Reshanta at random intervals and wreaks havoc. The Blood Crusade wishes to stop their threat, and hereby issues a kill order to be enacted immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  1. Locate the Elyos forces as indicated on the Top and Core levels of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1] and slay three or more of their soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  2. Defeat the Elyos by any means possible--brutal tactics are authorized for this mission. However, they must be of relative strength. There is no honor in crushing the weak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  3. When the kills have been confirmed and the enemy has lost the will to fight, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45502].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May you walk in Azphel's shadow. Blood for blood!</p>
