          <p>I'm sure that they key to taming a Pagati is catching it while it's young, in order to teach it that Daevas are trustworthy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a breeding population of Pagati in Sabat's End. Last year's brood is nearly a year old--old enough that they're weaned from their mothers, but hopefully young enough that they'll still be responsive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a path that leads up the cliff face on the west side of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D_03]. That's where they nest. Please go catch the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q41301_baby] around there, but watch out for the mothers!</p>

          <p>I've heard reports about the Balaur Pagati Cavalry's methods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur actually sleep in the stables with their Pagati the first six months they have them. But they also use some brutal methods to keep the animals in check.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd think that cruelty would turn the Pagati against them, but fear is a powerful motivator. My theory is that kindness and trust will work even better.</p>
