          <p>A scholar named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Favilian] has contacted me. He is conducting research on the Steam Springs to the south.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked me to send a Daeva who "didn't mind a little discomfort" to assist him. I asked him to clarify, but he refused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested, go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_S3] and meet him. Keep in mind I cannot guarantee your safety.</p>

          <p>Ah, you must have been sent by Desrona! Hmmm.... You look strong and hearty. You should do nicely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am studying transformational magic, and the Steam Springs make an ideal center of research. The local Starturtles and Gastrons seem to have transformational power, and I find it utterly fascinating. But it gets better!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Steam Springs themselves are rumored to have the ability to reverse forced metamorphoses. However, I need to test that claim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Battle against [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Monster_Quest_Starfish]. When you win, you will transform into a Gastron. Then, enter the Steam Springs and... see what happens!</p>

          <p>Excellent, excellent! So the Steam Springs do have the power to reverse the transformation. But how?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And why do these mindless Starturtles and Gastrons have this ability in the first place?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time I get one answer, I also get two new questions! Invigorating! This is for helping me advance the cause of knowledge!</p>

          <p>Desrona said Phavilian of the Steam Springs Research Expedition needed help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Phavilian, who was researching transformative magic, wanted you to investigate rumors that the Steam Springs could reverse forced transformations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By fighting Cotilo the Trickster, you confirmed this. Phavilian was delighted at this success.</p>
