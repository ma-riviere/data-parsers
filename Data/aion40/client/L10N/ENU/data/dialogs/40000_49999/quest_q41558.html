          <p>It's time. Wily Astus has slept for the last time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must break into his house, retrieve any documentation you find, and then kill him. The traitor shall know the price of his betrayal, and you, my friend, will show him.</p>

          <p>I know where you're going! I know you're going to find Astus, and kill him. But please, please listen to me--he's an old friend of mine, and I know that I can convince him to come back to us.</p>

          <p>Okay! Listen, I'm not asking you to save him. I just want you to buy me some time so that I can convince him to come back. We're old friends, you see. He'll listen to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've already placed a marker stone outside his house, right? Well, I've got another stone. I want you to place it in front of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S14]. It'll create confusion, and buy me some time.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Stoine asked you to save Astus? The IDIOT! None of this is easy for us, you know, Reians killing Reians is a horrific experience for us, one that we wish to be over as soon as possible. Stoine's actions, valiant as they may be, are completely unacceptable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], put an end to this ridiculous situation. Enter Astus' house and find [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_Document]. Once you have it, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_Monster_Q41557]. Now go!</p>
