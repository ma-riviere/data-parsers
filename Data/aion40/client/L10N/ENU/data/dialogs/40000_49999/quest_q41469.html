          <p>Hmph. You may be a member of Siel's Spear now, but that was just our initiation.</p>

          <p>You don't truly belong until you've done something that declares to the world that you're a member.</p>

          <p>What do you know about the weaponry that members of Siel's Spear carry? The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_60lvDeva_wepon] tells the world you're one of the few, the proud, Siel's Spear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a holy weapon, that even now many of our allies are desperately trying to make. It requires an incredible amount of effort on behalf of the one making it to gather everything that's needed.</p>
          <p> </p>     
          <p>So, [%username], are you up to the challenge? Will you carry a Luminasiel weapon of your own?</p>
