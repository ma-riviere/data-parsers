		<p>You have ten Daemon Tokens to spend? Twenty six other Daevas have spent that many today.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>That is not surprising. That many Tokens is quick to get, so Daevas get quick rewards.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>It makes sense. Rewards now help get more rewards later. So do you want to spend Tokens and get yours?</p>

		<p>You want to spend 20 Daemon Tokens? Thirteen other Daevas have spent that many today.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Daevas who have that many Tokens are very dedicated. They do a lot of good work for Charlirunerk. I am sure you are not an exception, nyerk!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Be proud. Having that many is a big accomplishment! So do you want to spend them?</p>

		<p>40 Tokens? 40 Tokens?! Only one other Daeva has spent that many today. And only a very few in past twenty days!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>It is hard to believe when Daeva has that many. Daeva must be very smart and quick on his feet to complete that many jobs for us.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Such smarts and loyalty to Charlirunerk must be rewarded well! So I hope you will let me give you a big reward for all those Tokens, nyerk?</p>

		<p>It is true! 40 Tokens! You are today's super Daeva number two!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I am surprised you are here with us, instead of in Abyss fighting lots of Elyos. That says a lot about your loyalty to Daemons. Glad your smarts are on our side, nyerk!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>This is least thanks Charlirunerk can give you for your service. Use them well. I hope to see you again soon!</p>

		<p>I gave you reward, I have...one hundred and six left. Not bad.</p>

		<p>But I will have less soon as more Daemons get rewards. But I do not mind. That means lots of work getting done for happy clients.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Charlirunerk's Daemons will have more work in future. Be sure to do a good job, and you will get more. See you then!</p>

		<p>You do not have as many Tokens as you said, nyerk. You are second Daemon today to try to pull that on me. She not successful, either.</p>

		<p>But everyone makes mistakes.... At least, I hope it was mistake. Next time, just bring more Tokens.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>So no reward. Let me know when you have enough. Now if you will excuse me, I have more records to do....</p>
