          <p>Hrm. Actually, this isn't all I need. Did you know Drana can feed on flesh as well as vegetation, grow in flesh as well as soil?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus, I believe I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41165A] samples to get a full picture of Drana biology. I suggest searching the oasis in the east of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1] and poking around in [%dic:STR_DIC_FOBJ_halfcorpse]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd be very grateful if you could do this. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm feeling a tad dizzy.</p>

          <p>Oh, hello, [%username]. I didn't see you. You really are quite stealthy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you had success with the Drana samples. I have a fascinating theory that I'm eager to test out.</p>

          <p>Okay? Why of course! I've never felt better! I feel like a powerful Drakan, towering mightily over the motes called Humanity!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hrm. At any rate, these are wonderful samples, useful samples! I should be able to work for quite a long time with these alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should be proud of yourself, [%username], for contributing to Drana studies. This will help us all against those despicable, majestic Drakan.</p>

          <p>Morphius asked you to get more Drana samples, this time of the kind that feeds on flesh.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found the proper Carnivorous Drana samples and delivered them. Morphius was happy, although he was still acting strangely.</p>
