          <p>My so-called "existence" as a mere training dummy was quite wretched! I shudder to think what it would've been like had I been able to feel pain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then I was brought to glorious life by an enterprising Spiritmaster who, I'll confess, was a bit... dotty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I managed to escape my previous confines... please, don't ask how. But then the necklace that animated me was stolen from me! By a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Bat_Dolphin_58_An]! Well, I won't stand for it! Kill the blighters for me, will you?</p>

          <p>Despite the nasty beasties wandering about, this is a marvelous place. I've never felt so at peace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But of course, while those blasted Goldenwing Murmurs still fly, I'll fret constantly about losing the necklace again.</p>

          <p>I'd doff my helmet to you if I had opposable thumbs. Or hands, for that matter.</p>

          <p>Still, here's a little reward. I got this from that Spiritmaster who gave me life. To your good health, my friend!</p>

          <p>Jenkin was animated by the necklace, given to him by a Spiritmaster. But a Goldenwing Murmur stole it from him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For his peace of mind, you killed the nearby Murmurs to keep it from happening again. He thanked you, though you were still agog with the surreality of the entire situation.</p>
