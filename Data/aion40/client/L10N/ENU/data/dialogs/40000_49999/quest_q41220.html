          <p>I've been in the Jotari region a long time. I'm no simpering city girl flitting around and worrying about my manicure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm not made of stone, either, and I worry about him. I can't help worrying, because without him, this life would become too bleak to bear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, sorry. I... It's my lover, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vereos]. He's just learned his next assignment is in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09], killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Silika_cristal_58_Ae]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would really ease my mind if you could go and thin them out before he gets there.</p>

          <p>It's hard being in love during such trying times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vereos is clever, and a good leader, but he's not the strongest Daeva I've met.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh... but he's also somewhat proud, so I hope you'll keep quiet about this.</p>
