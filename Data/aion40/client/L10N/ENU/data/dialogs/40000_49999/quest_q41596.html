          <p>This is bad. Very bad. Somehow the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41596a] an Outrider trusted to my care has vanished!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I know what happened. There was an attack recently, so there were some hurried withdrawals. I must've given it to someone else by mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This has never happened to me before! I must make this right by replacing what was lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Outrider said he got the ore from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticWorker_58_An]s. Please help me fix this. Please!</p>

          <p>Fortunately, the Outrider hasn't asked for his ore back yet. But when he does, I will explain what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will then report this to the Warehouser's Guild. I may be disciplined--severely--but I will take my punishment like a Reian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I can do now is replace the Hard Ore. Do you have some?</p>

          <p>It is, thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have obviously been lax in my training and meditation. I must redouble my efforts and make sure an error like this never happens again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was unworthy of your concern, yet you aided me nonetheless. I must thank you for that.</p>

          <p>Sephira accidentally gave away Hard Ore entrusted to her warehouse. She asked you to go to Avad Village to replace what she lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you terminated Avad Laborers and took their Hard Ore to her. She thanked you deeply, though she was still humiliated by her mistake.</p>
