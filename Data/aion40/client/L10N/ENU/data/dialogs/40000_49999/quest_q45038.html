          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ettins in the Hunibor Ice Gate area have been assailing passersby, seemingly at random. Normally, this would lie outside our direct area of interest, but these attacks have become more frequent and seem a bit too organized...and focused on Field Warden personnel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the Wardens have an...interest in the area, it is imperative that we locate the source of these attacks. If we strike at the Ettins directly, we believe it may draw out the real foe controlling Ettin activities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To this end, you are asked to hunt down and destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_EttinBigD_39_An]s. Upon completion of your task, report to your [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007] immediately so that we may track any responses accordingly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Is all Asmodae against us? It seems so some days. The Ettins now?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe it was the cold that drove them to such aggression. I know some days I feel like I could kill for a hot mug of some tasty beverage.</p>

          <p>You've done so much good for the Field Wardens, [%username]. It's been such a short time, and yet I feel like you're truly one of the family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe sometime we can sit down and chat about...things. Field Warden matters. But not yet. You're not really interested in that, and besides we're both busy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, here's your token. Don't spend it all in one place.</p>
