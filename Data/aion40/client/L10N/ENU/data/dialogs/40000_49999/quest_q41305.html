          <p>Just my luck. Not only do I get stationed at the backend of nowhere with a bunch of boring Brax-brains, but it's the last place to get supplied, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Supply transports go past here all the time, but do they stop? No way. Straight on into Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, we hear that supplies are coming down the pipe, but of course, that's the one transport that gets raided by Leowasps. So now our [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41305A]s are scattered all across [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D]... ugh. Could you look for them, please? I'd be so grateful.</p>

          <p>Don't tell me. The Leowasps and Zanthays ate all the supplies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, no, the Balaur took them. Or Tiamat himself swooped down and stole them all, just to be a jerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to assume the worst, [%username], or else I'll just be even more disappointed when things go wrong.</p>

          <p>Kahrun's eye, there's soap in here, and magic supplies... a newspaper! Look, there's even new socks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And--no shattering way!--are these actually fresh vegetables? I can't believe it, I haven't seen anything green in weeks! Oh, thank you so much!</p>
