          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our efforts to monitor Aetheric activity in Gelkmaros have been stymied after the sabotage of one of our Field Monitors in the Nunglark Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We has assumed that the tower's installation went unnoticed by the Naduka Legion that occupies the area, but apparently this was not the case.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to replace the tower immediately, but the area must first be cleared. Scouts report that several [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Baku_DR_53_n]s were seen being tended by a Mau near one of the Field Monitors in the area, and they must be removed immediately</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please report the results of your efforts to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Not as bad as some, I suppose. And at any rate, it was worth it. Now we can reinstall a Field Monitor in the Nunglark Village to help us keep track of Dae...Aether...in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What was I saying? The Mau. I will never understand the Mau. They love nature so much yet they work with the Balaur, who destroy and pollute nature more than anybody....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway I can see you're quite busy and so am I. No time for chit-chat or foolish questions. Here's your reward. Off with you!</p>
