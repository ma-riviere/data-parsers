        <body>
          <p>I am fascinated by ancient technology--especially that created by the Jotuns. Most especially the Petraliths.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever seen [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Bighands_58_An]s? The Balaur use them as a kind of attack animal, yet they look mechanical.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they are not Petralith parts, they must be closely related. I'd love to know more about them, but I can't leave my post.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2], fight [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Bighands_58_An]s, then give me your impression of what they're like, I'd pay you back for your time.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_padigishu]s, of course, are much too small to have ever been part of a Petralith literally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if I were to know a little more about their looks, behavior, and the way the Balaur use them, I could form a good working theory of what they really are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you fought [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Bighands_58_An]s. Tell me everything you can remember about them. Leave nothing out.</p>

          <p>Ah, fascinating! I wonder if this means the Balaur somehow have direct access to Jotun technology or know-how?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If so, it would be ironic... not to mention very bad for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your information! I'll be sure to let you know if I come up with anything interesting.</p>
