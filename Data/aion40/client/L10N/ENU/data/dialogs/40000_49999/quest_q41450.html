          <p>[%username], many of us have been following your work since you arrived in Sarpan. We've been watching with ever increasing levels of admiration, and now wish to invite you to join us as a member of our legendary [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel] Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Offering entry to one outside of our tribe is unprecedented, and if I'm honest, many of my peers have labeled me a heretic for suggesting you. But... I cannot ignore your talents. More importantly, neither will they, if you are able pass our tests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, tests: all who enter Siel's Spear must pass four great tests. I will present you with your first now: find the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41450_tester] stationed throughout Sarpan and Tiamaranta, starting with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Emeetia]. You will be timed, so move fast.</p>

          <p>You. Stop. So it's true. Kahrun really has offered an outsider entry to the Spear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I didn't know him better, I'd call him a fool. Yet Kahrun is the most intelligent man I know, and you came here in good time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's see how you carry yourself. Next you must find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Deloetia]. She's supposed to be somewhere around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Give up now. Recognize that some things are unattainable, and be content with what you have. You will not find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Draitia] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_A1]. You will fail, and bring shame to your people.</p>

          <p>Your heart's racing, [%username]. Are you sure you're cut out for this? You found me easily enough, but [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tinotia] is another matter entirely. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_S4] is a huge area, you know.</p>

          <p>Now, the time's still ticking. Get back to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun] and you'll be done.</p>

          <p>Excellent work, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may have guessed, the first requirement for any Spear warriors is that they possess speed, and the knowledge of how best to apply it. Our legion moves like the wind. They who fall behind are left behind. It is our way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, tradition dictates that I inform the temple of your success. You must pay [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aughoetia] a visit, and buy a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_01]. You will soon need it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>He warned you that plenty were opposed to your joining, but if you worked hard and passed the tests in place, they would have no choice but to authorize your access.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first assignment was to test your mobility. It was a demanding task requiring you to meet all four testers within a time limit. However, you were successful, and on your return, you were heartily congratulated by Kahrun. You then purchased a Sign of Faith, something you were told would be required.</p>
