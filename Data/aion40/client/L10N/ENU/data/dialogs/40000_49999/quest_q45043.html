          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may have heard, one of our fellow Wardens--a relative of one of our founders--was recently assaulted by an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_SkeletonReD_45_An] in the Brusthonin region. The creature's aura of chaos somehow destabilized the flow of Aether around her, forcing her from flight and into their clutches. While she survived, she remains wounded in spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return these foul creatures to the flow of Aether. Not only will this help to restore the stability of the Aetheric Field, but it will go some way towards restoring the courage of our fallen sister.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Destroy as many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_SkeletonReD_45_An]s as you can, and report the result to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Alaum] personally.</p>

          <p>You may have heard the statement, "We destroy to protect?" A paradox, but it demonstrates the spirit of all Daevas--and in particular the will of the Field Wardens--to a greater degree than you may realize.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Destroying creatures like, say, an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_SkeletonReD_45_An].... This greatly aids in the protection of all citizens of Asmodae. Tiny immediate victories ultimately build up into a greater long-term one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never doubt your mission--the only thing that awaits the hesitant is failure. Now...do you have anything to report?</p>

          <p>I'm pleased to hear that. You probably didn't know this, but the Field Warden that was assaulted was my cousin. No one else knows that, and I've kept quiet about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose it's not important in the greater scheme of things. But it's important to me. And so I thank you personally, as well as an agent of the Field Wardens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I could give you more than this token for your efforts, [%username]. Perhaps some day, when you are more.... But know this: your allegiance to the Field Wardens--and to me--will not be forgotten.</p>
