          <p>As you've probably guessed from our location, one of our tasks as hunters is to keep an eye on the Strigik.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But those birds are getting smarter. They've actually started raising [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Dionae_DR_57_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They tend them to adulthood, then loose them on the surrounding forests. It certainly makes my job a lot tougher.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Dionae_DR_57_An]s near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_02], it'd go a long way in countering their strategy.</p>

        <html>
        <body>
          <p>The worst thing about the Dionaes is their poison. You feel so ill that you almost want to die, just to stop the nausea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can carry potions, of course, but that gets expensive, especially with so many with greater need for such things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So killing the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A3_Dionae_DR_57_An] is a greater service than you may think.</p>

          <p>Ah, you're done? Wonderful! That'll show those Strigik a thing or two about Humanity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, we should coat our weapons with Dionae poison to use against them. That would certainly be ironic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's for later. Take a well-earned rest. Oh, and this.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>So when you slew many of them nearby, he was quite appreciative.</p>
