          <p>The Gritpaw Nojolf around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2] are cute little things by day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at night they're a different story. They... change. It seems far-fetched, but you'll have to trust me on this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], it's wisest if we eliminate as many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_FennecFox_57_n] as possible during the daytime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you're a thrill-seeker, go for the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_FennecFox_N_57_An]s at night around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2]. Just don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
