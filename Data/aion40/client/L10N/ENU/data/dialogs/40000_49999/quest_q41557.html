          <p>[%username], I need your help. I need you to follow someone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the traitors, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_Monster_Q41557], knows far too much about our defense network. If his information were to be conveyed to the Balaur, we would be rolled over in a matter of days. The quicker he's killed, the sooner we'll be safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now, I just want him tracked. I want you to follow him, find where he lives, then place a marker outside his [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_ItemUseArea_Q41557A].</p>

          <p>Excellent. First we retrieve our documents, and then we kill him. The traitor will pay.</p>

          <p>Aethon told you that a traitor named Wily Astus must be killed. However, you would first need to recover some information from him, and so tracked him to his house, where you then placed a marker.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You then returned to Aethon and were well rewarded.</p>
