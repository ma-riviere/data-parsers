          <p>The Blood Crusade has confirmed the presence of Elyos forces in Gelkmaros. The cowards are harassing our entrenched forces who are locked in battle with the Balaur. To help remedy the situation, the Blood Crusade has issued the following kill order:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  1. Locate and eliminate at least five Elyos soldiers who have infiltrated [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_DF4].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  2. Defeat the enemy using any means at your disposal--brutal tactics are approved for this mission. As ever, fight with pride; there is no honor in killing the weak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>  3. Report to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45503] once the kills are confirmed and the enemies have lost the will to fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May you walk in Azphel's shadow. Blood for blood!</p>
