          <p>Everybody has one thing that they fear, right? My greatest fear is the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_aponosFam].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're excellent hunters. They may look quiet now, but plundering is a piece of cake to them. Knowing what they're capable of, I can't help but worry about everything that I protect. As a warehouse manager, I have to secure everyone else's things!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], will you go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1_05] and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_BrohumBFi_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_BrohumGRa_58_An]s? They'll grow into powerful warriors and become a great threat to us far too soon.</p>
