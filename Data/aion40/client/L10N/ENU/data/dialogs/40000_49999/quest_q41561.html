          <p>In order to earn a Trust Marble, I have a small errand for you. It's favor to an alchemist I know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Raksang, defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Raksha], and bring me his [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41561a]. That's all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely a strong [%userrace] Daeva like you should have no problems? If you cannot handle this, then how could you ever handle the power of the Magical Aether Crystal?</p>

          <p>The Essence of Remorse could be used to create special potions and alchemy items that may turn the tide of the war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or so some say. We won't know until we get our hands on some.</p>

          <p>I assume your presence here means you succeeded in your task?</p>

          <p>Well, well, well. Perhaps you are stronger than I gave you credit for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then again, perhaps not. At the very least, you did what you promised. You've earned a Trust Marble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, one is not enough for the Magical Aether Crystal, so your tasks are not yet complete.</p>
