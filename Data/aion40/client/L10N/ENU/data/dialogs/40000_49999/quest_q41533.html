          <p>Whenever someone asks me what creature around here gives us the most trouble, I have a ready and immediate answer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd think it'd be the red hot Magma Spirits or vicious Enraged Maekis, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No! It's [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_MutantBeast_59_An]s! Those dracotouched things bite, ram with their horns, and their wounds always get infected! Always!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had no idea they existed before I came here, but now, I loathe them! You'd be doing me--all of us, really--a great favor if you killed a bunch!</p>

          <p>If I had my way, I'd be killing nothing but Korbats until they were all dead. But I have my orders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And so do you, I know, so I appreciate you taking the time to help me out. How'd it go?</p>

          <p>Oh, thank Siel. Neither you nor I can wipe them out as I'd like, but at least, there are fewer for the time being.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps my hatred of them is a little irrational, but spending time here is enough to make anyone a little insane.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you can use this. We don't have much here, but you deserve this.</p>

          <p> </p>
