          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you may be aware, the Discordian Fragments that have been spread around Asmodae by an unknown terrorist organization are composed of several toxic ingredients, the worst of which is distilled from the bodies of the Smiling Dragrints who have ingested Drana.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have recently learned that other agencies operating in Gelkmaros have become active in the Viscum Swamp, an area populated by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Agrint_Drana_55_An]s. We must do everything in our power to prevent them from obtaining this potent toxin.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Others have been assigned to track down these interlopers. Your task is to kill as many Smiling Dragrints as you can, and report the result to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021] immediately thereafter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>Are you one of the Wardens who was assigned Dragrint duty? I haven't been to the Viscum Swamp myself, but I've heard that entire area around the Twilight Drana Farm is pretty dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How did things go? Did you kill any Smiling Dragrints? Where did you leave the corpses? Be specific. We can't have just anyone harvesting Dragrint bodies, can we? What if a child finds one and eats it? It could happen!</p>

          <p>Hmmmm...I suppose I don't need to know exactly where they are. The area's not that large, and I'm sure another Field Warden will be assigned to...deal with the bodies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess we can cross "Discordian Fragments" off our to-do list, eh? Nice work. Here's your reward!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder what Chaotic and Entropic Fragments are made of....</p>

          <p>A letter from the Field Wardens asked you to slay Smiling Dragrints, which are a main ingredient in the manufacture of Discordian Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You slew several Smiling Dragrints in the Viscum Swamp, and reported the result to a Gelkmaros branch member, who rewarded you for your time.</p>
