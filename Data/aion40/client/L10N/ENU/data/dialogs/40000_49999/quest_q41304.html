          <p>Oh, she's so cute! And--yep, a full set of teeth, like I suspected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wow, [%username], she seems to like you! She'll be hungry, and since you're her mother now, you're going to have to make sure she gets fed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41304A] approximates the sound of a Pagati calling its young. If you kill a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_SandShark_58_An] and then use the call, your little friend here will come and eat her fill. Zanthay is their favorite food, after all.</p>

          <p>I think we've done it, [%username]. We won't know for sure until we try to replicate the experiment, and it won't be easy to give every egg this level of attention if we're raising a whole cavalry's worth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this experiment was a resounding success. I can't wait to send my report to Kamar!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you--you've done something invaluable for our mission here. This little girl will be the first Reian cavalry Pagati. She and I will never forget you!</p>

          <p>When the Pagati egg hatched, it was already bonded to you. Vesetia said that meant you were responsible for making sure it got fed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed Zanthay and used a Pagati Call to let the Pagati know it was mealtime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you checked back in with Vesetia, she was extremely pleased at the success of your mission and rewarded you heartily.</p>
