          <p>Oh, father! He and I were never close. He is... was... always traveling, more interested in Atreia's unturned corners than raising his daughter, but I loved him, and he me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was... he was a peace loving man. That was disagreement that we had, amongst others. But to explore the Wastes, with all its threats, you'd have to know how to fight, no?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judging from the state of the backpack, and the value of its remaining contents, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_ShulackAs_57_An]s probably killed him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot stand to think of my father's murderers going unpunished, [%userclass]. I... I want revenge! Will you help me?</p>

You did, only for Luanna to read through her father's journal while you were gone, and tell you that there was more to his exploring than she could possibly have known.</p>
