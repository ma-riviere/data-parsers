          <p>I've been tasked with helping you complete your Koligran, [%username]. I can hand you Signs of Sacrifice, the items that you must gather to pass this mighty test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to earn them, I must set you quite daunting tasks. This particular challenge requires you decimate the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41460all] that have been led astray by the vices and shallow elements of our world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once they are utterly ruined, come back for your reward.</p>

          <p>Remarkable. Even Reian traitors know how to fight--for you to carve through literally hundreds of them with such speed is quite something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But perhaps I shouldn't be surprised. The fact that you were even considered for Siel's Spear speaks volumes about your character and ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Congratulations, [%username]. You've earned this.</p>
