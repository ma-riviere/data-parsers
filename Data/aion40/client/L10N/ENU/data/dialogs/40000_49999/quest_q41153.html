          <p>You wish to learn more about the Reian people? Wise, Daeva, that you should attempt to understand your allies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do well to begin here, at Kamar--our capital city. It is the heart of our tribe. You should speak to its architect, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Salomone].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP_11], supervising the new city district's construction. He overflows with opinions, so I am certian he'll be happy to share some of them with you.</p>

        <body>
          <p>Flattery, eh? I'm happy to take it. There are some who don't appreciate the way I balance the practical and the beautiful, but then, I don't appreciate the finer arts of beating vicious creatures to death with swords. To each their own, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Personally, I think of this city as a metaphor for the Reian tribe. Fortified yet still elegant, built up brick-by-brick in defiance of constant assault by the Balaur and their blasted minions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's us, Daeva: powerful, beautiful, tenacious, and thriving against all odds.</p>
