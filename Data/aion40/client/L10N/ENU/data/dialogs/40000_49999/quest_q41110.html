          <p>Daeva, it's a pleasure to meet you, a real pleasure! I can't tell you how glad I am to have you and your friends here in Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We may have our differences, but hey, that's okay! There's one thing we can all get behind. You know what that is? Peace! Peace in Sarpan! It's good for everyone, isn't that right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to put you in touch with someone I think you'll really get along with. Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Olibaia]. She can induct you into the Sarpan Sandstorm, our great little peacekeeping effort. What do you say?</p>

          <p>The Sandstorm is committed to peace, yes. But in Sarpan, peace does not come unbidden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here we must fight for our peace. A noble cause, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Sarpan brims with warlike Sapiens--the Humnaz Calydon on one side, the Urugugu Strigik on the other, and countless creatures in between.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur, of course, are the worst of all, and all Reians have learned to dread the sounds of Dredgion engines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We rely on Daevas like you to keep our world in balance, so I'm glad [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ajenos] recruited you. Give him my thanks, will you?</p>
