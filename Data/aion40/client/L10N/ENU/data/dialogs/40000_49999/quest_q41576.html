          <p>Hello, stranger. What can I do for you? Interesting... I suddenly feel very odd. There's a particularly strong energy in the Edendell today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It feels strange and is throwing the whole place out of kilter. Maybe I should finally check out that Vortex today.</p>

          <p>Fascinating. Indeed, it "oozes strange magic," as you put it. </p>

          <p>This necklace is a very potent magical item. Only a most highly proficient wizard could've made it.</p>

          <p>You certainly have a knack for finding interesting things... what was your name again?</p>
