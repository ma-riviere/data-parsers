          <p>I love irony! Here's an example: the Drakan themselves may provide the means to defeat them! I speak of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41351A]s!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're mutated scales in the necks of certain [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41351all_1_1]. Aion put them there to make them hardier in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if we take it from their bodies, they make for suits of armor that even Drakan weapons can hardly penetrate! How's that for irony?! In fact, I want to make such armor now... but I need the scales. Feel like killing some Drakan? Of course you do!</p>

          <p>Ah, working with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41351A]s is so refreshing. It's such a great challenge, and such a rare material, that I feel honored.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Plus, each one reminds me that there's one more dead Drakan out there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, you must be one of the Daevas I asked to help me. How'd you manage in the Drakan-skinning department?</p>

          <p>Ah, yes, I do see! These are exactly what I needed!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't tell you how many normal scales I got from inexperienced Daevas who couldn't tell the difference. Glad we have someone like you on our side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I'm one step closer to finishing that armor! It'll be my greatest work yet, thanks to you!</p>

          <p>Seres asked you to get him special Reversed Scales from Drakan combatants so he could make a special suit of armor.</p>

          <p>You plucked the Reversed Scales found under some Drakan's necks and brought them to him. He was grateful for this progress towards his masterpiece.</p>
