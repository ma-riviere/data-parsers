          <p>You know, it's been several days now since the Leowasp Looters have flocked the village. They seem to be searching for something nearby.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They rummage through thickets and even knock down walls. I have no idea what they're up to. Could it have something to do with the missing Reians?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you take out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_DragonFly_57_An]s wandering the farmland on both sides of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_01]? If you can find any clues as to why they're here, [%username], it'd be a wonderful help.</p>

          <p>Any luck with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_DragonFly_57_An]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Leowasps are basically slaves of the Balaur. They do whatever their Belaur masters tell them to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the Balaur must be involved in the recent disappearances...</p>

          <p>The Leowasp Looters must have been looking for this note to cover their trail. Crafty buggers.</p>

          <p>Thank you for finding such important evidence. We'll have to carefully plan our next steps.</p>
