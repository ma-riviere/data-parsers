          <p>It's been quite a while since we set up camp here. That's probably why people think this place is our post, but this is only a temporary arrangement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, how can you sleep at night in a place where wild animals pounce on you whenever the sun goes down? The Grayhoof Daru have been driving me crazy. They charge through the tents, kicking magic supplies left and right, eating pages out of my books, grinding potions into the ground...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], please, I need your help! Would you please thin the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B1_Daru_DR_58_n] herds in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1]? Just think of it as a contribution to my magic research.</p>

          <p>Right after you left, [%username], I went back into my tent, and what did I find? A pair of Darus snacking on a priceless spellbook!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was too furious to even think of a spell to use on them, so I just hit them with my shoes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, tell me you've gotten rid of some of the Darus. Hopefully they're smart enough to learn not to come back here.</p>

          <p>Good. I really want to build a magic barrier, but I can't without an exorbitant amount of money to repurchase the ingredients I've lost here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, perhaps the attacks will come less frequently now. Never would be better, but I guess this is the price we pay for camping in Daru territory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you. I haven't much left to give you, but the Darus didn't manage to eat this.</p>
