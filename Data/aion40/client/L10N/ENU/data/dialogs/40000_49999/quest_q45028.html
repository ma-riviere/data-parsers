          <p>We continue to promote the "Balaurea Aetheric Field Observatory Plan" and hope to raise more Aetheric Field Observatories soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We continue to believe that Silentera Canyon holds the key to our success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We recently gained the cooperation of an agent in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_3021_A] named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Svidar]. Contact him, and deliver any message he has to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As ever, this mission is highly confidential and we urge you to take care in maintaining secrecy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of the Aion Tower go with you, Warden.</p>

          <p>Ah. You are here on Field Warden business? I have nothing new to report regarding the Crimson Favor Temple...at least not out loud. There is too much risk. I will simply send out another letter, as before. You only need inform a Field Agent of our rendezvous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And please, give them the blessings of the Aion Tower....</p>
