          <p>Listen up, [%username]. I have a high profile mission that I want you to take on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are three Balaur legions guarding Tiamat Stronghold. The Naduka Legion guard its west walls, while the Basrasa and Satra Legions protect the east and south fortifications respectively. The legions are each colossal, but they are not invincible. That's the message I want them to understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most effective way to deliver that message would be to kill one of their respective Brigade Generals. That's where you come in. I want you to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Dragon_General_Named_59_Ae], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Dragon_General_Named_60_Ae], or [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Dragon_General_Named_60_Ae]. Send them a message that we can kill whoever we want, whenever we want, and they'll soon lose their spirit.</p>

          <p>We'll watch their reports for the next while, see how they react as news of the assassination filters through the Balaur ranks. They'll know fear soon enough.</p>
