          <p>All guild members who hold the title of High Level Master or higher, harken to this request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A great ceremony to honor the Shedim Lords will be held soon. The centerpiece will be a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47503A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Buy a design from a crafting merchant in the Temple of Artisans, then bring your creation to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Quest_47500a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are expected to hew to the high standards we hold. Craft with love, craft with excellence.</p>

          <p>As you can tell, the request for a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47503A] is a special one indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now you are not honoring just any Daeva, but one of the first Daevas. This is no time to coast on previous achievement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must create something worthy of Lord Azphel himself! I hope you were up to the challenge.</p>

          <p>I know making a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47503A] isn't easy, but don't be afraid of putting your talents to the test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are not pretending to know what Lord Azphel will or won't like. We can only be so objective in judging excellence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, we will be fair--we definitely won't offer anything we don't think of worthy quality. I suggest you try harder.</p>

          <p>You are a High Level Master worthy of the title! I'd be astonished if Lord Azphel doesn't recognize your talent!</p>

          <p>The Shapers of Dusk is lucky to have someone as skilled as you amongst its ranks. You deserve this, and more!</p>
