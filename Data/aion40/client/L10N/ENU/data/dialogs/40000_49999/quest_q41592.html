          <p>You know the Balaur are causing all kinds of havoc around here, right? They've destroyed our Siege Chariots and have stolen my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41592a], preventing me from starting repairs. </p>

          <p>Worse, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_S3_DrakanFi_PagatiDrop_Destroy_58_An]s are openly taunting me, waving my tools around and snapping them into pieces!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need them back! Please, before it's too late.</p>
