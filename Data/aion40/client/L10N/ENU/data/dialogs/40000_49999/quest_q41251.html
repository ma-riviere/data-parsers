          <p>Ha! Never thought I'd see anything of his again after all those years. He was an outstanding Sorcerer, you know. Pytean the Flame Slinger, they called him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wasn't the best of husbands, but then, we never grew to live with each other as husband and wife. He was killed by the Balaur two months after our wedding. The wounds I carried are just scars now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This fragment, though... You know, just a few days before he was killed, we were out exploring the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_000] when we were attacked by a pack of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_Bookie_Crk_58_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We, or rather he, fended them off, but not before they stole his Cube. What if this fragment came from his Cube? What if there are others? [%username], could you look for me?</p>

          <p>I should apologize. That was a stupid idea. I should have let the past stay put, not sent a virtual stranger on a wild hunt for my own curiosity.</p>

          <p>Moraitia told you the fragment was part of something made by her husband before he died. She remembered an incident that took place a few days before his death, when he was attacked by a group of Mischevious Pucas and lost his Cube.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wondering if the fragment was from something that was in his Cube, Moraitia asked you to attack the same Pucas, and see if they had any other fragments on them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did as she asked, and returned with matching fragments. Moraitia, clearly astonished, now had to piece them back together.</p>
