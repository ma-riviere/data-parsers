          <p> 3. Details: This Wraithling is said to communicate to others of its kind through its roots. Client wishes to study this mechanism.</p>

          <p>Hmmmm. Yes, it matches description client gave us. Still looks pretty normal, though.</p>

          <p>If I put this to my ear, will I hear it talk? Would I understand what it is saying?</p>
