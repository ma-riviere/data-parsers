          <p>All guild members who hold the title of Artisan or higher, harken to this request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Craft a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47501A] to award to heroes of our Balaurea campaigns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Buy a design from a crafting merchant in the Temple of Artisans, then bring your creation to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Quest_47500a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are expected to hew to the high standards we hold. Craft with love, craft with excellence.</p>

          <p>Balaurea! The very name sends shivers down my spine! The Daevas there accomplish so much in such hostile territory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is why they deserve a well-made [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47501A]. To give them anything else is akin to direct insult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have high hopes for what you've made, [%username]. I do hope you don't disappoint.</p>

          <p>Er... did you really make a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_47501A]? It's not in your Cube if you have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's easy to make such items in a haphazard way. But to make something worthy of our Balaurea soldiers takes special skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't still be a member of the Shapers of Dusk if you didn't have that skill. So I suggest you try again and return.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Any Daeva with any sense would consider this a worthy reward for even the toughest battle in Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will reflect very well on our organization. You more than deserve the promised rewards.</p>
