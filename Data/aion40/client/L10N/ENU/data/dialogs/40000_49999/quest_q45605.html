		<p>Come to seek a reward for fighting off those Elyos weaklings, [%username]? I swear...Daevas these days. The screams and tears of the Elyos are the only reward a real Blood Crusader needs! </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But...I suppose since it's my job I'll talk about the Crusader Tokens. Complete missions for us, and earn tokens. Bring me the tokens, and I'll provide you with combat supplies to aid in your fight against the Elyos. Easy!</p>

		<p>The morons who package the combat supplies don't do much to tell us what's in the crates. All we know for sure is the quality of the supplies that are put inside.</p>

		<p>The more tokens you bring, the better the quality of supplies you'll receive. Are you sure you want to trade in just seven? Come on, [%username], is that all the offense you've mustered against the Elyos? Why not collect 15 or 30 tokens?</p>
