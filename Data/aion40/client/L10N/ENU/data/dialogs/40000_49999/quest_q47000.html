          <p>Task: Altgard Security Inspection</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Welcome to the Marchutan Priory. Our organization is dedicated to helping the newly ascended "learn the ropes" of being a Daeva, so to speak.</p>         
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have been assigned to inspect the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q47000]s near Altgard Fortress to ensure their proper functioning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Locate a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] and take the Crystal Balls from the Ward Orbs. Note this cannot be done alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring the Crystal Balls to me for examination. Keep your eyes open and be willing to learn.</p>

          <p>The Priory handles all newly ascended Daevas these days. I hope you found a Mentor who suits your style and needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'll recall, you need to give me the Crystal Balls you collected.</p>

          <p>Here they aren't. You may not think you'll learn much from such a simple task, but think of it as a taste of what teamwork can bring. Plus, this inspection really needs to be done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, to open a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q47000] and get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_47000a] inside, you'll need to work with a Mentor.</p>

          <p>Such routines keep the Balaur, Sapiens, and Lepharists at bay so we can concentrate on greater things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you've learned something from the experience. Thank your Mentor the next time you two meet.</p>
