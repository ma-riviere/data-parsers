          <p>I think I've found the best crystals yet for weapon making! They are found in the Blue Quartz Valley.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>BUT--there's always a "but," isn't there, my friend? Ha! But, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_ComadFi_59_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_ComadWi_59_Ae]s are ruining those precious crystals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't really make use of the crystal until with those... those things are gone. What are they, anyway? Mamut dung, it doesn't matter... can you help me out?</p>

          <p>Incorporating crystals is proving to have its own unique challenges. But that's the part I love the most! Ha!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine I would enjoy it if it was easy. The challenge and effort make it all worthwhile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That and the looks on the Balaur's faces when they realize what they're up against! Any luck with the Komads?</p>

          <p>Excellent, [%username]! You are certainly good at what you do!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can focus on my work now. I'm so close to a breakthrough with these crystals! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd appreciate if you would continue to help keep the Komads in check.</p>

          <p>Shumaron determined the crystals in Blue Quartz Valley made good weapon material, but the lingering Komads ruin the crystals there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You helped out by killing Elite Komad Warriors and Elite Komad Sorcerers, and Shumaron thanked you for your help, able to finally return to making his weapons.</p>
