          <p>To all those joined in The Circle:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Oracles have warned us of an upcoming meeting between the Balaur and Ice Claw Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've intercepted the Balaur envoys and learned that the Mau plan to make an tribute, possibly something of great power or value.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Become a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] for any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_25_35](s). Then disguise yourselves as Balaur at the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2_FOBJ_Q47105a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An Ice Claw Head Priest should meet you at once, and your [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Da_25_35] must speak to him. Take the tribute to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mephisto], who will reward your success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always remember our mission: to be a guide and advisor who allows young Daevas to realize their destinies.</p>

          <p>Drakan worship among the Mau makes them at once dangerous and easy to exploit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why the "Draconute Guard" must talk to the Head Priest. The Mau don't dare speak directly to Drakan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of which, that Mau tribute has attracted a lot of attention at Pandaemonium. Do you have it?</p>

          <p>Mmm, no, that doesn't look right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a delicate mission. Any wrong move with protocol and the Mau may become suspicious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why it's vital to work with your charge closely on this one.</p>
