          <p>The Lepharist Revolutionaries make a third front in a two front war. We must defuse their threat in order to focus on the Elyos and Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Accompany a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Mentor] to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_D5] and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparFiCrazyNamedQ_39_Ae].</p>

          <p>I know you may be reluctant to fight your own people, but rest assured that the Lepharists have no such compunctions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In a way, they're as much fanatics as the Elyos, worshipping false gods. Such a path leads only to ruin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Killing Chairman Wonshikutz will delay their plans for a while. I assume you succeeded?</p>

          <p>Having a Mentor around made the going much easier, I wager. Perhaps you two could work together in the future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope one day you become a Mentor to younger Daevas. Then Asmodae's strength will continue to grow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, we have some valuable breathing room now as far as the Lepharists go. Good work.</p>
