          <p>Devoted Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Observatory readings indicate that the amount of Aether in the atmosphere has dropped quite suddenly and unexpectedly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only independent research will enable us to verify whether or not these readings are valid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, we have our own Aetheric Field Scanners--developed by the Pandaemonium Research Center--installed in key areas of Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring the findings from some [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45008]s to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007] as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>I've heard several disturbing rumors lately, Warden. Some have said that the Shedim Lords are...accelerating their advance on the Balaur. This may be due to the amount of...Aether dropping quite rapidly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But rumors are just rumors, you understand. Back to work.... Did you bring the Scan Results?</p>

          <p>And I think not. I was led to believe you would be bringing me something from the Aetheric Field Scanners in the Beluslan area.</p>

          <p>This is not a highly difficult mission, [%username], but it is important. Please return when you have something to show.</p>

          <p>According to a letter from the Field Wardens, Aetheric Field Scanners were installed in key areas of Beluslan to find out why the amount of Aether decreased.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You located some Field Scanners and brought the Scan Results to the Beluslan Field Agent, who rewarded you for your time.</p>
