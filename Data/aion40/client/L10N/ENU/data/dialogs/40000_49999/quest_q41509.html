        <body>
          <p>Tiamaranta's Eye is a double-edged threat--both the stronghold's fortifications and the troops within are a danger. We Daevas can handle the troops, but we need something to take down the weapons and walls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why we're making Trebuchets. When we have enough, we'll leave nothing behind but rubble and twisted metal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But much must be done before that can happen. If you're interested in aiding our efforts, go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S3] and meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Debron].</p>

          <p>Ah. Daeva [%username]. I do hope you won't disappoint me. Let me cut to the chase.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Twister_58_An]s are hampering our Trebuchet construction efforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They whip up storms that ruin equipment and cause unacceptable delays. They must be dealt with. At once.</p>

          <p>I have VERY high expectations of those I am in charge of, [%username]. </p>

          <p>You are not technically one of them, but you did take orders from me, did you not?</p>

          <p>If you failed in your mission, I suggest praying to Lady Siel and Aion for deliverance.</p>

          <p>Ah, it's so refreshing to find Daevas who keep the promises they make.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now perhaps we can catch up to our schedule. We'll definitely need more manpower, perhaps some overtime...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, I congratulate you. Do keep up the good work.</p>

          <p>Zas says more hands are needed at the Siege Troop Garrison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went there and talked with Debron. He complained about Dust Twisters causing construction delays.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you got rid of Dust Twisters, and he thanked you... in his own way.</p>
