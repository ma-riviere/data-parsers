          <p>Honorable Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until recently, the Aetheric Field has been stable in Gelkmaros--good news, as we prepare to raise an Aetheric Field over all of Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Gelkmaros atmospheric movement is showing signs of increased intensity and we must monitor the situation more closely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Immediately proceed to Gelkmaros and retrieve the Monitor Record from an [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q45021], then bring it to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing must stand in your way.</p>

          <p>There is much more to protecting Asmodae than monitoring the Aetheric Field, but we have to start somewhere. I wonder if raising an Aetheric Field over all Balaurea is even possible. Unless we can secure enough Aether, it might be futile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you bring news?</p>

          <p>What? You've nothing to hand me, Warden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Field Wardens have a great interest in the situation in Balaurea, [%username]. If you are here it means you received a letter to that effect, requesting the retrieval of certain Monitor Records? No?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I am mistaken.... Perhaps I am waiting for some other, more honor-bound Field Warden.</p>

          <p>Is that the exact data your letter requested? Let me see what it says. Accuracy is essential....</p>

          <p>Well, I guess it isn't time. There doesn't seem to be any major change in Gelkmaros yet. You may go, [%username]. The remainder of this task is mine.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You located the device and brought the Monitor Record to a Gelkmaros Field Agent, who said the situation remained unchanged.</p>
