          <p>Kinotia and I are very poor. I've been struggling to earn enough money for the medicines she needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been taking every bounty hunt I can get in addition to my duties here. It's exhausting; that's why I haven't been home for so long. But if Kinotia trusts you, perhaps you could help me, and thus her, out? There's a significant bounty right now for killing [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41265all_0] in Satrakand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have time to do it, but if you were to do it for me, I'd get enough for it to share some of the spoils with you. How about it?</p>

          <p>Phew! While you were away, I managed to sneak in another bounty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just a few jobs more, and I can afford the treatments for Kinotia. They're quite complex and very expensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But enough about my problems. I take it you killed [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41265all_0]?</p>

          <p>Hah, I understand what you mean! But I insist on giving you your share of the bounty, as I promised.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard keeping up this pace, but when I think about why I'm doing it, I remember why it's worth it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only a little while more, Kinotia. I promise....</p>
