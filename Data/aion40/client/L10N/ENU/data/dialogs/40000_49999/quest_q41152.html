          <p>I cannot tell you of Kahrun's mind--only what I know of the man from his actions. He is sometimes a mystery to me, but I have not served him for as long as some others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raffaele] is on the Elder Council with Kahrun and has known him for much longer than I, so perhaps, speak to him. He's also commander of the Siel's Spear legion, so the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP_07] is where you will find him.</p>

          <p>You're one of those foreign Daevas, aren't you? Well, you'll have no complaints from me if you wish to fight beside us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm an old man, Daeva, far too old for false hopes. I've no delusions of permanant peace like some of these young striplings around me. No, I know that no alliance is perfect, no union unshakeable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm not too old to wish for something better for my people, and Kahrun... well, he's not perfect, but he does seem to know what he's doing.</p>

          <p>Interested in our leader, eh? Well, he is a compelling subject.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you heard the rumor that he has Empyrean blood in his veins? Or that Aion speaks to him personally? No? Have you heard the one where he is part Balaur but cut off his own tail to pass for Reian? That's my personal favorite.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all just gossip, but it keeps this old mind entertained. My advice? Decide for yourself the kind of Daeva that Kahrun is.</p>
