          <p> </p>
          <p>Wardens gathering plants and herbs in the snowfields north of Beluslan Fortress have recently fallen under attack by Spriggle Gatherers. Needless to say, this is greatly hindering our efforts to restock our medical supplies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your assistance in hunting down [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg3DF3_33_An]s is hereby requested. Slay the beasts, and report your success to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45007] immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The task is yours, Warden.</p>

          <p>Spriggles aren't known for their ferocity.... I wonder what's got them all riled up. Maybe we intruded on their turf? Or maybe....</p>
