          <p>Daeva, got a moment? I could sure use your help! For the life of me, I just can't seem to find my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_kahrun_quest_material].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Equous] has some, but he only takes Kahrun's Symbols. Those're the tokens that the Sandstorm use for their reward system.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can redeem Kahrun's Symbols for some great little items, Daeva! Well, hey, you can check it out while you see if Equous has a spare Information Officer's Seal! Wouldn't that be great?</p>
