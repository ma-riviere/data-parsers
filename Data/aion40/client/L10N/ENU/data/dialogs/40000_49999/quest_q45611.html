		<p>It's admirable to see a Crusader acquire 30 marks. That [%mainslotitem] of yours must have have sealed the spirits of hundreds of Elyos Daevas. </p>

		<p>I suppose the one good thing in all of this is that this war may never end. In a few hundred years, I might get another chance to fight, instead of just handing out supplies....</p>

		<p>That's amazing, [%username]! So few Daevas have the ability to earn 60 Crusader Tokens; even fewer are sufficiently devoted to the cause to save up that many. I can hold nothing but sheer respect for soldiers of your caliber.</p>
