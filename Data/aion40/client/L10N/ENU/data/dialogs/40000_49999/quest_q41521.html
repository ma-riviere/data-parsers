          <p>Where, oh where are you, little Marble? Come out, come out...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't plumb the secrets of the Vortex without that pesky Marble of Transfiguration. It keeps wandering off...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! Hello, stranger. You've caught my wayward Marble of Transfiguration, I see. Lovely! Well, then, since you already have it, why don't you transform into a Drakan and explore the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S4]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fascinating to consider where the Vortex might lead: someplace new and exciting, or certain death--who knows? Do come back to tell me which.</p>

          <p>Hello, stranger. Did you happen to notice the Vortex at the edge of the garden over there? I'm sure it's connected to somewhere...</p>

          <p>So you're saying the Vortex connects to a small cave occupied by a mysterious Drakan?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And she knew who you were, even though you'd never met her before? Even though you were in the form of a Drakan? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had hoped to simply explore the mystery of the Vortex, but I think I'm standing instead in the middle of an entire labyrinth of mystery--layer upon layer of secrets. My great thanks... [%userclass].</p>

          <p>Kiriyu wanted to probe the mysteries of the Gravity Vortex. You agreed to explore the Vortex for him, even though he could never remember your name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You transformed into a Drakan using the Marble of Transfiguration he gave you and entered the Vortex. Within was a small cave that led you to the Dell Witch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Drakan asked you to remove the Rotrons and Murmurs that were ruining the garden. After you got rid of them, the Drakan made it clear you were not welcome back. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After listening to your tale, Kiriyu suggested that he now had more mysteries to uncover than he did before.</p>
