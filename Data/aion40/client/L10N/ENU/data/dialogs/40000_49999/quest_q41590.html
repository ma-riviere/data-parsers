          <p>Haha! We've got them by the delicates, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at this place! Think the Balaur would send so many of their best troops here if they didn't perceive our siege as a serious threat? They come and they come, and we fight them back and shatter their walls!</p>

          <p>Briaz told you about how the Balaur Cavalry were panicking from the siege weapons, and had sent their best units to disable them. You wanted to help, so fought against the Balaur scouts.</p>
