          <p>We have a problem. Our elders have refused to let you enter Siel's Spear, despite passing the tests. I suspect pride has blinded them, but I have argued your case, and we have come to an agreement. They have given you one more test to pass.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our ancient scriptures tell of a punishment given out to the worst Reian criminals: cowards, traitors, and murderers. They were sent to complete the Koligran, a grueling challenge that tested their spirits and strength. Those who failed were exiled and left to die alone in our lands.</p>
          <p> </p>        
          <p>Our elders have demanded you undergo the Koligran. To pass, you must collect 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_01]s, 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_02]s, and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q60devanion_03].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Oddone] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pasquale] will tell you more. Go to them now. And [%username].... Good luck, friend.</p>

          <p>The Koligran is a gruelling and exhausting exercise, [%username]. Forcing you to pass it shames my people, for which I can only apologize. Still, the elders must authorize every entry into Siel's Spear Legion....</p>

          <p>I will present this to the elders immediately. They will have no choice but to accept you into the legion. You have made me proud, friend. And you have opened the eyes of several too afraid to see.</p>

          <p>Kahrun told you that even though you had passed the standard tests to gain entry into Siel's Spear Legion, many still refused to allow you entry. Finally, Kahrun struck up a deal: you would take an ancient Reian test known as the Koligran. Only after passing would you gain access.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You left and worked with Orn and Pascal on collecting the items required to pass the Koligran. The work was arduous, but eventually you had everything required.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun was visibly relieved on your return, and welcomed you into the legion. Now there was just a simple matter of a ceremony....</p>
