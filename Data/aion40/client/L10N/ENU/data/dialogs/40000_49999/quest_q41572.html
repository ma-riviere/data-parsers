          <p>I dropped the Fruit Basket to chase after the Worgs. Y'know, for its skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have thick fur that should make for a warm cloak for my granddad on those cold nights. But I don't want to be worrying Granddad. I'll head back, quick quick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you do me a favor for Granddad and hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Monster_Quest_Zaif] for its [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_41572a], [%username]? He'd love it! </p>

          <p>You found my granddaughter! Thank you... [%userclass].</p>

          <p>I know she did it for me, but what if she gets hurt by a Worg or some other critter?</p>

          <p>It's a wonderful gift. I can't thank my granddaughter enough and apparently you, too.</p>

          <p>Here, this is a token of my thanks. Please take it.</p>
