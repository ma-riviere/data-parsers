          <p>Progress on the "Balaurea Aetheric Field Observatory Plan" continues to be stalled, but our goal remains to control the Silentera Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To do this, we need to contact an ally at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A]. Infiltrate Inggison and speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fundin], then carry his message to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mission requires extreme confidence, as you might expect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of the Aion Tower go with you, Warden.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>How goes the fight in Inggison? No doubt you fought all the way here. Hopefully this battle will end soon...so we can win the war alongside the Field Wardens.</p>

          <p>I knew it. So few have such a sense of purpose when they come here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have nothing new to tell the Wardens. The Silentera Canyon continues to open into Inggison, just like in Gelkmaros. If we can unveil the secret of all four fortresses, we might be able to use the Silentera Canyon as we wish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send a more detailed report on the Altar of Avarice to the Field Wardens separately, but I fear they will be disappointed. Just tell a Field Warden that you met me, and that I wouldn't abandon them for a key to the Temple of Gold.</p>

          <p>Excellent. I'm glad Fundin is still with us. I'll use your "Temple of Gold" code to decipher his encoded mail, but your duty ends here.</p>
