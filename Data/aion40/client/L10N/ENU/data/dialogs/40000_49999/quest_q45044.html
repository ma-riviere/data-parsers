          <p>Field Warden:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reports from the Brusthonin area indicate that Perpet Falls has become contaminated--those drinking water from the area have suffered from a range of symptoms, including stomachache, nausea, and other digestive issues. Thus far no one has died, and local agencies have already informed the populace not to drink the water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to fully understand the toxin's effects over time, a more detailed study must be performed. A herd of Wild Kurins has been spotted downstream of Perpet Falls, and they will perhaps prove helpful in our...studies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please proceed to Perpet Falls and engage with any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CuresSpotD_47_An]s in the area. Afterward, please discuss your observations with [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45014]. In particular, watch for the following symptoms: aggression, fearlessness, increased strength, and frothing at the mouth. These were expected in humanoid subjects but were not observed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This matter is highly confidential, so please destroy this letter after reading it.</p>

          <p>I'm glad I caught you, [%username]. Have you heard about Perpet Falls?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't recommend drinking the water there for another few weeks. That's what the Pandaemonium Pharmaceutical Lab says, anyway. They're...studying it closely.</p>

          <p>What news do you bring me?</p>

          <p>From what you tell me, Kurins seem to be behaving normally...for Kurins, anyway. But if they drank more of the water, might they ingest more of the...substance and thus increase its effect?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or perhaps they're building up an immunity? Hmmm....</p>

          <p>Sorry, alchemical matters are a particular fascination for me. Here, take your token and leave me to my ruminations.</p>

          <p>You destroyed Wild Kurins and reported your observations to the Brusthonin Field Agent, who rewarded you for your time.</p>
