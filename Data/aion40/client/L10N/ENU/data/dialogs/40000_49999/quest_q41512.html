          <p>Look at this place. Do you think it's easy coordinating supply lines, making sure each is protected and running efficiently?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course not! And the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Dionaea_58_An] just make things worse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most infuriating part is, they're just dumb monsters! They just steal our supplies because they're shiny!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every delivery is precious. Can I depend on you to recover the stolen [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41512a] from the Dionae?</p>

          <p>Between supervision, direction, and planning, every available second of my day is taken up. It's an exhausting duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I needed someone to go on this task for me. Did you get the supplies back?</p>

          <p>Oh, superb, superb. These will be sent out to their proper destinations at once.</p>
