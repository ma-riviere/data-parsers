          <p>History informs the present. It makes us who we are. I have great respect for the Reians studying Sarpan's past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The research being done up in the Jotari Wastes is especially important because the Jotun that used to live here were highly advanced. We could find something more useful than just facts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Jotun themselves tend to get in the way, as do the Shulacks, who raid archaeological sites. The Sandstorm is targeting a group of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q41107_All]. Bring your band and eliminate one of them, [%username].</p>

          <p>I've been hearing good things about the Jotun Research Expedition's find.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why it's important that you and your group eliminate the obstacles in this expedition's path.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you did eliminate the Target?</p>

          <p>Shuel sent you after a group of Sandstorm Targets that included Trickster Pabarakin, Nemeco the Dancer, Munarim the Hobbler, Nubale the Glacier, and Hakur Stonebraid. She called the group the Jotari Expedition Obstacles because they were hindering the group's research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You and your allies took out one of the Obstacles.</p>
