          <p>For the Field Wardens to advance our mission further, we require more than Pandaemonium is able to provide directly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To this end we have been in contact with a fortress quartermaster named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Inauke].</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meet privately with her and see if she has any updates, then bring any news to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_45021].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the protection of the Aion Tower go with you, Warden.</p>

        	<p>Why thank you. Now listen.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>The enemies of the Field Wardens are everywhere, yet I continue to do what I can to help, at great risk. However, I've found evidence that another spy has infiltrated one of the supply ships.</p>

          <p>Until I know who the spy is, and where they are from, I must...hold off on my "assistance" for a while.</p>

          <p>Please deliver this message, with my condolences.</p>

          <p>Yes, I had heard of this. We think this spy is one of the Lepharist Revolutionaries. Fortuantely it was not who we thought, but Norrin is wise to remain cautious. We cannot allow our...relationship to be exposed.</p>
