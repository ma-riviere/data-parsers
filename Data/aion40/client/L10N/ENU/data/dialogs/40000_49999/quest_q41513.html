          <p>As you already know, we've been focusing our attack on the Balaur Cavalry Base. Unfortunately, they have grown wiser and have begun to retaliate. Drakan continue to assault our Scout Post.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are simply too many, so we've installed mines as a deterrent. By Siel's Spear, we could use your skills, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bury this Aether Mine in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S12]. The mine will explode automatically when the Drakan attack.</p>

          <p>Good, good. With it in place, those Drakan won't stand a chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's so frustrating, so sad, to think that this battle could go on for years to come. It is all consuming. It's a wonder we're not all lost to despair.</p>
