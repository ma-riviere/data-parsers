          <p>I have another mission for you... but I'm not sure how to begin on this one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so long ago, a squad of Sandstorm Legion Elite Soldiers went to mop up some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41116a]. It should have been a routine operation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, they were defeated--unable to kill even one. Some of the soldiers were even displaced because they had never bound their soul to an Obelisk. We underestimated this enemy at great cost...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I immediately thought of you, [%username]. You're sure to have many colleagues of similar skill. Please, kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41116a]. Avenge those who have gone before you. If it's too difficult, even just killing one of them would help.</p>

          <p>The horn of a Zanthay, they say, is a mighty aphrodisiac when ground up and ingested. But you can't remove the horn without killing the creature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I'm glad you're back, [%username]. Can the fallen rest in peace? Did you kill one of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41116a]?</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each of them is truly formidable. Which one did you face?</p>

          <p>Well done. Thank you. You're really amazing at what you do.</p>

          <p>I appreciate you taking the trouble. Here, the gratitude of the Sandstorm...</p>

          <p>Even you must be exhausted, though. Take a long rest. You've surely earned it.</p>
