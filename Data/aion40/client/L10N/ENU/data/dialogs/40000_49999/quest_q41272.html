          <p>Did you know that Violetip Neokins start out as normal, everyday forest beasts? They become twisted by the Balaur's Drana energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some elders say that Tiamat deliberately transplanted these animals to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2] to create vicious guardians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such outrages can't be allowed to stand, I say. Killing the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Kuillus_DR_57_An]s would be a mercy, for them and us.</p>

          <p>If there's one thing that the Drakan have done that's absolutely unforgivable, it's their twisting of nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were created to defend and nurture Aion's entire creation, including nature. For them to pervert it so...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_Kuillus_DR_57_An]s are now at peace.</p>

          <p>I'd hoped you would take this seriously, [%userrace]. I'm glad you did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad there isn't a way to revert the Neokins back to the animals they once were. Perhaps I should try to find one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure that if Aion could appear before us right now, you would get the thanks you deserve. I can only hope mine is good enough.</p>

          <p>Dohios told you that Violetip Neokins begin life as normal animals but are mutated by Drana thanks to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was disgusted at this meddling in the natural order and asked you to kill Neokins for him to avenge Tiamat's actions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, though mostly to make things easier for Daevas rather than nature.</p>
