          <p>Finally! I've finally earned enough money to buy Kinotia's treatments!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The potions will take a while to create, but all my hard work has paid off at last! I'll be able to go home to the woman I love. But... but how do I tell her this wonderful news? It has to be something special... I know! Her favorite soup! But I need the ingredients!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C2_SalivadoRed_58_An] spines. They wander off the path north of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2_01]. Could you get some for me?</p>

          <p>It's been ages since she's tasted this soup. It'll be such a great treat for her.</p>

          <p>With all she's suffered lately, she deserves it. The good news will only make it taste even better.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41268A]s are for the stock. If you brought them, I can get it started.</p>

          <p>Indeed! And there are still bits of meat on it, too!</p>

          <p>I've already got the water boiling, so in they go! Mmm, it's smelling good already.</p>
