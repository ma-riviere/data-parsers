          <p>More and more Reians are displaced by the Balaur every day. They're exhausted. They've lost their homes and loved ones. Even worse, monsters haunt the Refugee Camp and terrorize the people there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Camp inhabitants call them [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_FennecFox_Nmd_56_n] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_SpakyButterfly_Nmd_56_n], and they're causing major headaches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could kill just one of them, it would be a great boon to peace.</p>

          <p>Rajalf the Cunning is the Nojolf den leader. He's unusually smart and very short-tempered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Queen Maphis may be a mere insect, but her wings spread poisonous powder wherever she flies... and she flies very far indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which one of them did you kill?</p>

          <p>That's the one I would've taken out myself. Perhaps we think similarly.</p>

          <p>The Sandstorm Legion will not forget your aid, and neither will the refugees, I wager.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They cannot reward you as would befit your deeds, but I can, on their behalf. Please take this.</p>
