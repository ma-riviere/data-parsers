          <p>I've got good news! Your performance in the last bounty hunt was so impressive that I was offered double to continue!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I were to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41266all_0] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C2], I'd be paid enough to go a very long way towards being able to pay for Kinotia's treatments! And, I have some spare time this time around, so why don't we divide up the duties? Of course, I'd divide up the spoils as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can even keep whatever the Drakan hold. I'll take on half the kills and you take the other half. How about it?</p>

          <p>Whew! Those Drakan are tough customers! But then, if they weren't, the war would be over by now, wouldn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad to see you back safe. Kinotia would never forgive me if someone else got hurt on her behalf.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So how did it go? Did you manage your half of the hunt?</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you the moment you told me about your kindness towards Kinotia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only she could Ascend! Oh, that would solve all our problems. But Aion has not yet seen fit to look her way. If only....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But far be it from me to question Aion's will. I'll deal with this as best I can. Here's the share of the bounty, as agreed.</p>
