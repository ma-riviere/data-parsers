          <p>The magic permeating this necklace is very different from that of the Edendell. You can learn a lot about a place or thing from its energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The energy signature of the garden, for instance, is like that of the Balaur. Their influence is all around us... unfortunately. The energy in this necklace, however, comes from the Reian Tribe. I'm sure of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, now that I think about it, I recently came across a place nearby with a similar energy. Take this necklace to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S15] and try to instill power into it. Perhaps that will clear things up. Probably not terribly dangerous. Probably.</p>

          <p>Thank you! It was SO lonely here. Just locked away in my own head like that. If it wasn't for you...</p>

          <p>I just don't want to imagine the solitude any longer! Oh, leaving already? Do come back, very soon! I have SO much to talk about...</p>

          <p>Kiriyu felt confident that the Reian Tribe had given the necklace magical power. He said there's a place nearby that gives off similar energy, so you went there and instilled the necklace with power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the nearby Training Dummy woke up and started talking. And talking.</p>
