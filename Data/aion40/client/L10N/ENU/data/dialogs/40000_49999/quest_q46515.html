          <p>We have been hired by several anonymous interests to investigate a Balaur named Harviste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail!</p>

          <p> 2. Location: Twilight Drana Farm</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: A Drakan who oversees Drana production. Our client wishes to study fresh samples of Drana to determine how the Balaur are producing it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To claim the reward, Daemons must bring Drana samples from the Twilight Drana Farm. To do so, it will be necessary to fight Harviste.</p>

          <p>The Balaur are all so scary, nyerk! Is there not even one that is as cute as us Shugo? Akakakak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Who knew trip to farm could be so exciting? A farm with monsters and Balaur everywhere! And I used to think they were boring!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have never seen Drana, though. Lucky this job makes you bring me some. So did you bring me some?</p>

          <p>Remember, he is at Twilight Drana Farm. Probably have to fight and defeat to get at Drana. Make Charlirunerk proud, now!</p>

          <p>Huh? This is Drana? I thought it was some kind of fruit, nyerk! I cannot eat this! It would break my sensitive Shugo teeth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, well, probably for the best. Would not want to eat fruit Balaur grew. It would probably be icky and bad for health.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A little disappointing, still. But you got to beat bad Balaur! That is always exciting! This is your reward!</p>
