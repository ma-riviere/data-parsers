          <p>Oh, thank Aion! I have been sending prayers most earnest to the Lady Siel that a Daeva would come to my aid, and now--ha ha!--here you are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, I remember! It came to me on the wings of a dream, a vision both disturbing and enthralling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am not Gurriki, my friend, not truly. I had forgotten, but this dream returned the memory to me. I am a Reian, beset by a wicked rival's curse!</p>

          <p>Yes, I have relearned my true speech. It was not easy, nor was eschewing the insects my fellows here gobble so voraciously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All these Gurriki ever think of is their next meal. It is a relief to speak to someone of real intellect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I am so eager to return to my true form. To fly again, Daeva! To soar!</p>
