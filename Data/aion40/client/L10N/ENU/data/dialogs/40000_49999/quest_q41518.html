          <p>Fear and suspicion hang over Tiamaranta like fog. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_A1] has more than its share, so I'd like you to do some reconaissance work. I need to know if any of the rumors I've heard hold water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are reports of monsters bursting out of rifts, of soldiers disappearing into them and emerging somewhere completely different. And I've heard suspicious things about a camp that's sprung up north of Edendell... well, I'd rather hear first-hand what's going on up there, so you'll need to investigate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll mark the locations on this map. If you're willing to help, please start with the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4b_FOBJ_Q41518A].</p>

          <p>I... did not expect to have all of my worst suspicions confirmed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What is the point of fortifying our camps when a fault could open next to our beds while we sleep? How are we to hold this alliance together when even our own people--our own blood!--turn their backs on us?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh... I apologize, [%username]. It is hard to celebrate your success when it brings such darkness in its wake. But you have done your part well.</p>
