          <p>Listen up, [%username]. I've a task that needs assigning, and I think you're just the [%userclass] I need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been scouting out the Naduka Legion for some time now, and have identified two high-profile targets that we want dead. Their names are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanFi_Tiamat_Named_59_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanWi_Tiamat_Named_59_An]. Without them, the Naduka Legion will be headless, confused, and that much easier to wipe out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you say? I only need one of them assassinated for now.</p>
