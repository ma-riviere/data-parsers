          <p>The Mau may seem like mindless savages, but I assure you they are anything but.</p>

          <p>Hopefully, the Claw Spears should tell us what materials and skills they have access to, especially from the Balaur.</p>

          <p>I beg to differ. Remember, if you and your Mentor separate, you may not find the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_48602a]s you need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or were you not able to find a Mentor? If so, I encourage you to redouble your efforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This isn't just about your own development, you know. That would be arrogant. Altgard itself will benefit from your task.</p>

          <p>These should do nicely. I'll take these to General Suthran as soon as we're done here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You and your Mentor have done fine work. I can already see your strength growing.</p>

          <p>Here are some further rewards from the Priory. Congratulations on your success.</p>
