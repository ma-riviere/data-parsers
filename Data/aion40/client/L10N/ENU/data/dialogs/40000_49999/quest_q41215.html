          <p>Th-thank you, [%username]. I told you before that my father and I were never close, and... not once did he mention me in this journal. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I loved him as much as a daughter could, but I could ever get his attention. There were always new ruins to uncover, new languages to master.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I'm glad I could honor him. Perhaps he's watching me now. Perhaps not...</p>
