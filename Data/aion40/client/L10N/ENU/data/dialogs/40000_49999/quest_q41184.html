          <p>Ah yes, [%username], you're one of those foreign Daevas that Kahrun rescued, aren't you? If you think you're up to it, I have a project for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been hearing the most ridiculous rumors about those little Nojolf that run around here. Something about them turning ferocious at night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all just slave-gossip, I'm sure. You know how low-ranking soldiers whisper. Go out to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1_04] and take out some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_FennecFox_56_n]. It should be easy enough.</p>

          <p>Sarpan Zayedan Vereos received ridiculous reports that Nojolf turn into ferocious monsters at night.</p>

          <p>While he didn't believe the story, the gossip upset his men, so he sent you out to kill some Feral Nojolf.</p>

          <p>When you'd finished, he decided to go out and kill some himself to further appease his soldiers.</p>
