          <p>The Koligran is no laughing matter, [%userclass]. Its name alone is spoken in hushed tones, so fearful are we of its implications.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, with you, it's being used for something different. There is no threat of exile, just a test to allow an outsider into our most revered legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can award you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41454a_01], but to earn it you must slaughter the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41455all]s. They have threatened our people for long enough.</p>

          <p>So... so the stories were true?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd heard stories of a great [%userclass] decimating the Brohum, but I just assumed they were made up by someone looking to capitalize on their recent inactivity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems we were wrong. Take your prize, [%username]. You've earned it!</p>

          <p>As part of your Koligran, you were ordered to head to the Aponos Brohum Village and kill everything there. The work took much time to complete, but when you had done as you were asked, you returned and received your reward: a Dedication Curio.</p>
