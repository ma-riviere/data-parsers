          <p>Ah, you! Yes, I need your help! An assignment, actually. Geology.... lots of fun, those rocks. So interesting to watch, and... ah...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, I don't really know what I'm talking about. I just need someone to go to the Fissure Barrens and meet with one of my men. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grido]'s his name. Lovely man.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, ah... interested?</p>

          <p>Ah, you look confused enough to have been sent here by Grandia.</p>

          <p>I knew she was desperate to get me help, but she asked a Daeva? Grandia, you've outdone yourself!</p>

          <p>Oh, you don't need to tell me, my friend. Shows you the power of relations though, eh? That woman owes everything to her father.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, since you're here, I could certainly use your help. From a geological point of view, there are a great many things worth studying here, and I'm not just saying that to sound dull.</p>
