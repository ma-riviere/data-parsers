          <p>The supply lines are constantly teeming with Braxes, their drivers, and the supplies they carry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As all three are highly edible by Balaur and other creatures, it's no surprise the lines get attacked all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's still inconvenient, though. Even just getting rid of some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Slime_Snail_Sand_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Dionaea_58_An] would help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, was that a request? No? Then I'll make it one. Do it.</p>

          <p>Whew, I've been busy! The supplies have been pouring in hard and fast lately--more so than in a long time.</p>

          <p>I thought that might be the case, but I wasn't sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I forgot this would all make more work for me. Oh, well, it's for a good cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I did ask you to do it, so it's not your fault. Enjoy your reward while I get back to work.</p>
