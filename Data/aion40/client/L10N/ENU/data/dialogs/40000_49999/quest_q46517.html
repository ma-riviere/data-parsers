          <p>An eminent archaeologist has hired us to exterminate a Wraithling called Vinestem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As always, the pride of Charlirunerk's Daemons is at stake. We must not fail! </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p> 2. Location: Near the Giant Wreck in the Petralith Canyon</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> 3. Details: Vinestem is hundreds of years old, sustaining its life by preying on any living being it comes across. Even those who escape suffer nightmares for the rest of their lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vinestem is known to disguise itself as a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FOBJ_Q46517] to lure unwary prey. Be alert and cautious when dealing with them!</p>
