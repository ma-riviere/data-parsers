          <p>I like you, [%username], I really do. Since it seems like you and your friends will be here in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_sarpan_main] for a while, I want you to make yourself right at home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, you should really meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ulstia]! She's just great, knows almost as much about [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP] as myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's the High Priestess of Kamar, and I think you two will really hit it off. Hey, and tell her I say hello, okay?</p>
