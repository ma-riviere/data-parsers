        <body>
          <p>The vegetables and herbs I gather are delicious, certainly, but what I really love is meat. Raw, bloody, succulent MEAT!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you surprised? Well, it takes a lot of strength and energy to do what I do, especially around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oooh, that reminds me: I haven't had a good Mamut Steak in ages. If I had time, I'd rip a Mamut's head off with my bare hands for some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it is, I'd love it if you'd get me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41175A] from hunting [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_mammoth_DR_57_An]s. Pretty please?</p>

          <p>I'm getting weak. I encountered a Sheluk while gathering yesterday and could only tear three legs off it before it died!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I usually get all eight easy! It must be because I haven't eaten meat lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The more I think about that [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_41175A], the more I drool. You'd better have some.</p>

          <p>My... you certainly know how to butcher your Mamuts! I could eat these raw right now!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it'll taste better when I sear it a little first. Give me my steak rare, or give me death!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you'll accept this, [%username]. My gathering should go much more smoothly now that I have my meat! Praise the meat!</p>

          <p>Nalotia loves her meat, but she hasn't had any of late. To help her out (and because her violent tendencies scared you), you agreed to hunt Trepone Mamuts for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You butchered them for their Mamut Meat and brought it back to a hungry Nalotia. She thanked you, drooling at the thought of her rare steak dinners to come.</p>
