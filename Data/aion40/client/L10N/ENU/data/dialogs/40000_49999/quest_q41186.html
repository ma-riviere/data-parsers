          <p>You must have seen the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_000] around the Destroyed Guardian's Seal. It's my job to make sure that doesn't happen here, as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But protecting the Seal isn't just making sure the Balaur don't blast it to shards. For example, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_SalivadoRed_57_An]s are drawn to the heat that the Seal produces, and they crawl all over this thing the moment I'm distracted. They could easily shut it down by accident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are dozens of them around [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1_04], and they're not terribly hard to kill, but I can't leave the Seal to deal with them. If you could do it, it'd be a great help to me.</p>

          <p>The Guardian Seals are the only reason Sarpan survives Tiamat's wrath. Well, the Guardian Seals and Kahrun. If Kahrun hadn't taken the reins, who knows where we would be?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd all be Dragonbound, probably. I can't imagine a worse fate than that.</p>

          <p>You know, I noticed that there were fewer around. Well, that's one less thing to worry about.</p>
