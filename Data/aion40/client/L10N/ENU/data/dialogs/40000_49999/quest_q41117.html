          <p>Although they are a lot fewer in number compared to the recent past, the Balaur still pose a very real threat. Many peacekeeping bands have been sent in, including the Sarpan Protectors, but we keep failing to neutralize the threat completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We decided to take a different approach: to incapacitate their command system. But pacifying Drakan of that strength is no easy task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you take care one of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41117a], [%username]? With reliable colleagues, I think you can do this.</p>

          <p>Thank you! And... you don't have a single scratch on you! You must have some equally capable friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the first time, I actually feel like there's a real chance for a lasting peace in Sarpan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you continue to lend your talents to the Sandstorm Legion. You are truly moving mountains, [%username].</p>
