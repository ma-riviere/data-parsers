          <p>The other day I was hunting Leowasps up by Sabat's End Cemetary, and a ghost started lurching toward me in a distinctly unfriendly way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I fought it off, but it really seemed to want me dead. I'm no coward, [%username], but that gave me the shivers. And I'm not the only one who's had a bad experience up there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D_03] used to be peaceful, but something has disturbed the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Fi_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_Yun_undead_Wi_58_An]s. They're unnaturally angry. Send them back into the Aetherstream to calm their restless souls.</p>

          <p>That cemetary used to be such a nice, quiet place, where you could go to pay homage to fallen comrades or ponder the meaning of life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's sad to see that even in death, our dead are still tortured by Tiamat's power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you send them back into the Aetherstream?</p>
