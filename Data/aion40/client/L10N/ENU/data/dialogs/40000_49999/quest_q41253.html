          <p>[%username], while you were fighting the Balaur, I found myself lost in thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already mentioned how my husband wasn't the best of spouses, but I've not held him dear since he passed either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Truth be told, I virtually forgot about him in the years since. This whole carving business has left me wanting to make amends. But I don't know how.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, could you help me? Speak with a priest, find out what I must do to pay my respects to my husband? Try [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ulstia].</p>

          <p>I know why you're here; I heard all about the situation. The truth is, the dead do not care if they are honored or not. They are dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, that does not mean that the act of honoring them is pointless. It heals those that are left behind, and reconnects children to their elders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My suggestion? Place something at Pytean's grave. The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41253b] is a common choice, and can be bought from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aughoetia]. If you do buy one, bring it here so I can bless it.</p>

          <p>Then it is time to go to Pytean's grave. Leave now for [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D_03]. Pytean was buried at its highest point. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Keep your eyes peeled for an [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_Tomb_Q41253]. Most of the others have been weathered to nothing, but such was Pytean's fame that his apprentices still maintain his grave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you find it, place the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q41253a_flaower] on it. Then Moraitia will be ready to get back to her life.</p>

          <p>Moraitia had essentially forgotten to pay her respects to her dead husband for years. After seeing the carving that he had made for her before his death, she was filled with regret, and wanted to find out if it was still possible to make amends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You left and met with a priest named Ulstia, who said a simple bouquet on his grave would symbolize her love for him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to Sabat's End Cemetary and placed a bouquet of flowers. When you came back, Moraitia thanked you for your gesture and told you that she'd never forget her husband again.</p>
