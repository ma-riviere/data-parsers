		<p>Ah, [%username]. I hear you've been doing good work for the Field Wardens lately.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>But you didn't come here to chat about work, did you? You're here for supplies. By now you know that you can get higher grade Warden Supplies by trading in more tokens, so I don't need to explain that.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>So, how many Ward Tokens did you bring with you?</p>

		<p>For six Ward Tokens, I have some decent Tier 1 supplies for a [%userclass] like yourself. Of course if you collect 14 or 30 marks, you can get higher grade supplies.</p>

		<p>Well, well. It looks like you've been collecting Ward Tokens for a while now.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>It must have been a lot of work to collect this many. You can trade these in for some Tier 2 supplies if you want, or you can keep saving.</p>

		<p>When we started out we couldn't afford to give out supplies like this. Field Wardens essentially worked for free. Can you imagine?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Fortunately, we now receive financial support from Pandaemonium, in appreciation for our...special contributions to Asmodae.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If you've collected 30 tokens, you must be pretty patient--but I won't make you wait any longer. Hand over those tokens, and I'll give you your Tier 3 supplies.</p>

		<p>I think you need to count your Ward Tokens again, [%username]. You don't have as many as you thought. You wouldn't be trying to take supplies you haven't earned, would you? That's not fair to the other Field Wardens.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Maybe get a Shugo to help you count, if you can't do it yourself. Then get back to me when you have things in order.</p>
