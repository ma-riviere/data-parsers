          <p>Here in Sarpan we have a saying: "For want of a nail, the wheel was lost. For want of a wheel, the cart was lost. For want of a cart, supplies were lost. For want of supplies, the battle was lost--and all for the cost of a Brax-cart nail."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, so maybe I took some liberties with the saying, but it's true. Properly supplied soldiers can make or break a battle. That's why [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D] is the most strategically important part of Sarpan--it's the only supply line into Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't really have problems with losing nails. Instead, we have problems with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_DragonSnake_58_An]s biting the wheels right off our supply carts. Think you could help?</p>

          <p>Those Serrators are real monsters. I saw one tear a plank off of a supply cart the other day and eat it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It ate a plank! How do you even chew that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, there's not a lot to eat around here, so I suppose they've adapted to their environment... but a plank? Especially when it could've just gone after the Brax!</p>

          <p>Ha! Well, great work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Opening up supply lines could have a decisive affect on our war in Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have a saying in Sarpan that goes like, "From small deeds, great names are born." It may seem minor to you, but your work here is appreciated.</p>

          <p>Zayedan Shemion is worried that Violent Serrator attacks on supply lines through Sabat's End will affect the battle in Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To ensure that Tiamarantan soldiers are well-supplied for their fight, you eliminated Serrators from the area.</p>
