          <p>The Basrasa Legion.... I understand they harry those who guard Inggison. They do give us plenty of headaches as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanFi_Tiamat_Named_59_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_DrakanWi_Tiamat_Named_59_An], two of their top commanders, have been responsible for some damaging raids of late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This must stop. I urge you to go to the Basrasa Legion Garrison and kill one of them to send their troops into confusion. If you do, you will be well rewarded.</p>

          <p>Tiamat's claws are long and sharp. They spread wide and cut deep.</p>

          <p>We must trim them whenever we can. I hope you have done your part...?</p>

          <p>Hewing down such arrogance has a certain justice to it, doesn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, we must not become complacent. The Basrasa Legion will reorganize in quick order. Then there are their Clerics....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But even a small respite gives us the opportunity to strike back. I hope you come to our aid again in the future.</p>
