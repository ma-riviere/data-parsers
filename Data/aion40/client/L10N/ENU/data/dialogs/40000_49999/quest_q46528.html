          <p>WARNING: Arges can slow his prey down and make them unable to fly. Daemons must bring in Twisted Ore to recieve rewards.</p>

          <p>It is important to defeat Arges, but more important to retrieve Twisted Ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is because Twisted Ore created Arges, and everyone wants to make sure that it does not make another!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, must kill Arges to get Twisted Ore to begin with, so it all works out! Are you reporting success?</p>

          <p>Client's need was very specific. Even if you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DayQ_CyclopsOd_55_An], you must also bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_46528a].</p>

          <p>So that is Twisted Ore? I wonder if it can mutate Shugos? Yipe! Imagine giant hulking green Shugo, nyerk!</p>
