          <p>Perhaps this was my destiny. Perhaps this is why I have been here in [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF1_name] all along. Your path lies bright ahead--the life of a [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09] awaits you.</p>

          <p>These are your first steps toward discovering your former glory, [%username], and in light of this, I must ask you a simple question. Do not think too hard on it--allow your natural memories and instinct to guide you to your answer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before you lost your memory, you were not a simple [%userclass], but rather one of two distinct Priest classes. Tell me, which path did you walk?</p>

          <p>A Cleric you say? Intriguing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much like the Mage, a Cleric uses magic, but rather than harming others, the Cleric prefers to heal and fortify allies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Clerics also revive comrades who fall in battle, making them invaluable in the kind of group combat Daevas face in the Abyss and elsewhere.</p>

          <p>The Chanter is versatile yet powerful, capable of strengthening allies with magical chants while also dealing out significant damage.
