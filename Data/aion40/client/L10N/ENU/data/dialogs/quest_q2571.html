          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]! Are you busy?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was wondering if you could deliver this vaccine to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vonduca]. She's the leader of the watch here. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you haven't met her yet, you definitely should.</p>

          <p>Well, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vonduca] is just an incredible person. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She never learned how to swing a blade, yet she's become head of the Watch because everyone trusts her judgment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was the one who led the villagers here.</p>

          <p>The village was overrun with undead people and livestock. The few remaining Humans had to get out fast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vonduca led that group of frightened people, including elderly villagers and children, safely through to this refuge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Personally I think it took a lot of guts. So, would you be willing to meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vonduca] and deliver the vaccine? </p>

          <p>Very good.</p>

          <p>Give her the package and tell her that this is the Undead Vaccine I mentioned before. She'll understand.</p>

          <p>I'd just like you to have a talk with Vonduca and this is a good excuse. She really knows what's going on around here. She's a good person to know.</p>

          <p>Ah, so this is it? Sleipnir says you don't become undead if you drink this?</p>

          <p>Whoah, it smells really bad! But regardless, I'll have it distributed to the people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish we had this vaccine before, but I suppose only Lady Siel had the luxury of moving through time. We Humans, and even Daevas, must live with events as they happen.</p>

          <p>Centurion Sleipnir said Watch Leader Vonduca is an amazing person, and told you to deliver a box of vaccine and have a talk with her.</p>
          <p> </p>
