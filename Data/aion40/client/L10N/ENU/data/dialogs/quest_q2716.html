          <p>As you've seen, a great variety of creatures live in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Scholars theorize these creatures came from Atreia and were swept into the Abyss right after the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most were warped and altered by the Aether and harsh environment here, but interestingly, there is one creature that looks exactly the same as it was in Atreia.</p>

          <p>The Klaw. You may have seen some if you've been to Morheim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're very social, they have a complicated hierarchy system, and you can see how intelligent they are in their attacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On top of that, they adapt quickly to new situations and environments. They reproduce rapidly and are expanding their territories.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But enough of the biology lesson--I just need you to help stop the constant influx.</p>

        	<p>I've asked some Klaw experts, but none of them had a permanent solution. There's no medical process or special chemical agent to get rid of these things, unfortunately.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>So, it looks as if we'll be doing this the old-fashioned way.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>Since they account for the bulk of the population, I need you to go to the Bloodburn Reach and get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_NeutL1_40_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_NeutH1_40_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_NeutL1_39_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_NeutH1_39_An]s.</p>
