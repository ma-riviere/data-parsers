          <p>Well met, Daeva. I'm glad to see you around here. I worry sometimes that everyone has forgotten that we exist out here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems I've got no shortage of things to worry over lately. I've been concentrating on the Kaidan Krall problem, but Dionera pointed out that we've now got a serious issue with Tigrics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Locals have been coming to her with report of Tigrics to the southwest of the Observatory. I need the locals to be my eyes and ears out there, and if they're hiding in their homes, it means the movements of the Krall and Lords know what else is going unseen.</p>

          <p>What? Don't you know about the cursed Tigrics?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The locals believe that Tigrics are portents of ill omen. Everywhere they appear, bad things happen. An epidemic crops up, herds of livestock die mysteriously...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know there's nothing to it. Tigrics are just animals. But the locals believe it, and that's enough to keep them in their homes.</p>

          <p>It's a real bind for me. If we leave the post to go hunt down the Tigrics, the Krall might attack while we're gone. If we do nothing, it lets the Krall move around at will, so they can mass for an attack without us knowing it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only real solutions are for us to get more reinforcements, or for us to hire someone to do the job. I heard that you used to be a mercenary before you ascended, [%username]...</p>
