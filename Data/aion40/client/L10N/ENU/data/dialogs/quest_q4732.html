          <p>You've decided to take up my mission to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_D], then?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It shouldn't be too tough for a Daeva of your talents. Now, let me give you the full briefing.</p>

          <p>First, you'll need to infiltrate the Nochsana Training Camp with a team of your allies. Our ultimate target is the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_DrakanFi_27_Ah], but he's inside the Fortress, so you'll need to destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_Door_Dr] to get to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you up to that?</p>

          <p>There's an artifact inside the camp that will make it much easier to get through the gate, so first you should take out the Nochsana Protector and activate the artifact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this siege weapon. You can use it to take down the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_Door_Dr]. Once you've done that, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_DrakanFi_27_Ah] will be a piece of cake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I have things to be getting on with, so once you're ready, tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF2_Barlack], and he'll send you to the training camp.</p>

          <p>Excellent, excellent! That should take the heat off for a little while. I'm sure they'll have more recruits on the way, though. Don't know how they keep making new ones, but there always seem to be more Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any time you feel like it, you can go back there and knock a few heads together. Work off some stress.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>He said you'd done a great job, but that there would always be more Balaur, so you should go back there any time you felt like it.</p>
