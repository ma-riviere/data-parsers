          <p>Kentari are cantankerous beasts, but for all their faults the smarter ones are excellent cooks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surprising, isn't it? I've discovered that the secret ingredient in their cooking is a special spice. I tried to replicate it, but it's impossible. The Kentari keep the ingredients a secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since producing the spice is impossible, I've now succumbed to stealing it. Don't judge me, [%username]! You don't know real flavor until you've tasted stew made with Kentari spices.</p>

          <p>I don't want to harm the Kentari--I wouldn't want them to stop making the spices after all. However, I managed to steal a bag of the spices when I donned some cumbersome armor and waded into their camp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might sound stupid and reckless...but it worked great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The armor was a fantastic idea, but then it started to wear out after being bludgeoned, bashed and slashed a few hundred times as I left the camp. Now I need materials to make another set of armor. Do you think you can help, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Just bring me the skins of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardD_29_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_merdionD_29_n]s. Balaur skin would be ideal...but the skins of those animals will work. Well, at least for a few minutes. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creatures should be right around here. Please get the skins as soon as possible...I'm running low on spices!</p>

          <p>Take this, and please come back later.... I'm thinking of starting a little enterprise as a Kentari spice merchant.</p>
