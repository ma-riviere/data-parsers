          <p>You've make me so proud. Now, to receive your title, you need to get authorization from Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vidar].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry about getting his authorization. I'll write a recommendation letter. Vidar respects my judgment. So receive the title, and attend the Induction Ceremony. Off with you, shoo! Before you make me cry....</p>

          <p>Amazing, [%username]. With your talents, you could easily set up a restaurant in Pandaemonium. But I understand you're too active in the field to pursue such a course. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cooking is an ancient and respected skill, in every way equal to the skills of the warrior or the sorcerer. Expert cooks bring both sustenance and joy to their comrades.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I salute you, our new Cooking Expert!</p>
