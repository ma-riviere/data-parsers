          <p>Do you have time for a job, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surely you've seen the heavy numbers of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Kalnif_6_An]s all around the Anturoon Crossing. They're nothing but trouble--between attacking our runners and eating our main food source, it's a wonder we're still alive at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, food...you see, we eat a lot of Brax up here. But Brax are also the main prey for the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Kalnif_6_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this continues much longer, the Brax will be hunted out of the area and we'll be back to munching on Sparkles and grass. That doesn't do much for a raider's strength.</p>

          <p>So you see our dilemma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't have time to get out there myself--not with the reports that Tobu expects--but surely you can help us out. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get out into the fields and kill a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Kalnif_6_An]s for us. We can't get rid of all of them, but if you can just cut their numbers, we'd be grateful.</p>
