          <p>The Calydons are running wild through the countryside, but honestly that's not usually much of a motivation for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say what you want about Bounty Hunters but we're up-front about it--the only thing we're really interested in is Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got a running bet in the camp on who can hunt down the most Calydons every week.</p>

          <p>Only ten so far this week. I know it shouldn't be a big deal, but the winner last week was Nagrunerk! How can I hold my head up when I'm bested by a Shugo?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you'd have to do is go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2B_SZ_C5] and get rid of some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonAssassin_49_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2A_CalydonMage_49_An]s. And be quiet about it--I'm paying you so I can take the credit.</p>
