          <p>I can't wait for the order to wipe out these Krall.</p>

          <p>You bet I am! It gets so frustrating basically doing nothing all day.</p>

          <p>Hmm, if we cleared out the sources of danger in the swamps around the village, that might do the trick.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_D2] is filled with dangers, but the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3Mudthorn_33_An]s are particularly vicious.</p>
