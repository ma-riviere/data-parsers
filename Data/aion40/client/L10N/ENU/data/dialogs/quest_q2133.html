          <p>Oh my weary, aching bones!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so long ago I was a sprightly young lad who could handle just about anything thrown my way. Now it takes me days to recover from the simplest task. It's this job, I tell you--lookin' after that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ran_1] kid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's a handful, and she's got a mean right hook. Ulgorn don't want her followin' in his footsteps, but she's her father's daughter that's for sure. Look at these bruises!</p>

          <p>Yeah, but they ain't cheap, and I ain't made of Kinah, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I got options, though. I'm one of the few raiders Old Urd talks to, and she told me 'bout a local healing remedy made with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_herb_d_n_c_10a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can use the herb to make a quick healing potion. It grows naturally around here, but lately, it's been hard to come by.</p>

          <p>It's much harder to find these herbs than it used to be, but come on... you can do better than this! Just head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_3] or the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_4] and keep your eye out for the tall herbs.</p>
