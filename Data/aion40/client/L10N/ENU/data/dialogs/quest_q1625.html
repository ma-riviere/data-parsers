          <p>Voluptes, remember? The Daeva's Ceremony at the Lyceum? We stood next to each other... Ah. Well, I was there too. Never mind.</p>

          <p>Ah, good to see you too. I have to say, you've made amazing progress since then. I hear about you all the time. Very impressive. </p>

          <p>As it is, I'm about to set out on my first big sortie as well. We're heading out soon to attack Bollvig and I'm leading the troops. It's a great honor.</p>

          <p>The road to The Storm Circle is treacherous. To keep morale up and my soldiers together, I'd like to use torches and light the route there. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need every advantage we can get, and it's not as though there are many avenues we can use to attack. Doing this won't give anything away. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are seven Torches in Patema Ruins. A guy named Luric took them from Mountain Shiver in Calon, but we don't have enough oil for all of them. Could you get me some fuel to keep them burning? I'll ask the Admiral to reward you appropriately. </p>

          <p>Great! I really, really appreciate it. Now, the best substitute for torch oil is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1625a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are lots of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Starturtle_40_n]s along the coast around the village. If you could hunt some and collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1625a], we can make this plan work. We'll need at least seven lumps of fat to use in the torches, so you'll need to hurry.</p>

          <p>Oh...right. I'm sure you have a lot to do. Sorry about that. I'll see if I can re-task one of my soldiers. I was hoping they could rest before the battle, but we do what we must.</p>
