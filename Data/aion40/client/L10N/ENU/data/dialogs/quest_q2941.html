          <p>Excellent, [%username]! I've heard of your reputation as a [%userclass], but you are every bit as accomplished with your handicrafts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do know that we occasionally make sacred items that are devoted to the Shedim Lords? I just thought I'd mention it. Not for any particular reason, of course. Just slipping it casually into conversation.</p>

          <p>I've had an urgent message from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fraiban] in the Abyss. He's in urgent need of Salix Staff Handles. Again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either the Salix Staff is the current must-have fashion accoutrement in the Abyss...or the war is going badly, and we're using up weapons faster than ever. I don't think we need to ask which, do we?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't send just anyone on a job like this. It has to be someone who can handle the Abyss. Would you deliver the package, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Well, we have a big problem then. I was so certain you'd accept my request, [%username], I didn't think about who else I might ask.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd go there myself, but there's simply too much work to do here. And...I'm just hopeless in a fight. There, you've shamed me into admitting it. I hope you're happy.</p>
