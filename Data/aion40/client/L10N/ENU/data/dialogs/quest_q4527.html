          <p>[%username]! Good timing. I have a very sensitive task for you. It came to me from the highest levels of Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I warn you now: the risk will be great. But the glory and rewards will be equally great...provided you succeed, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've hesitated to give this mission to anyone, frankly. But if anyone can handle it, I believe you can.</p>

          <p>You would need to slip into Elysea, to the region of Heiron. In the southeast is a place called the Island of Eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It appears inaccessible, but there is actually an invisible bridge connecting it to the mainland. You need to find it and take it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There, on three of the main landmasses, you will find your targets: three Kerubar.</p>

          <p>These are no ordinary Kerubs. The power they hold is incredible, beyond even some Daevas. We don't know how they got it, which makes it even more vital that they be destroyed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may stay on the Island of Eternity now, but who knows what they will do if they gain power? They already have followers among the Kerubs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a hazardous trial indeed. You will need to consider carefully before you accept.</p>

          <p>I won't pretend I'm not a little apprehensive, but I'm glad. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim2_46_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim3_47_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim4_48_Al] must be dealt with, no matter what the cost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will be in the midst of enemy territory, so it goes without saying that you should probably not go alone.</p>

          <p>I will be hoping for your safe return. May Azphel watch over you.</p>

          <p>I do not blame you. If you have the slightest hesitation, you should not accept this mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Going to Elysea and engaging these Kerubs without unshakable confidence will prove deadly. That I can guarantee.</p>

          <p>If you find that you change your mind, please return. Otherwise, I assure you that I think no less of you.</p>

          <p>One thing all Asmodians who've been to Elysea tell me is that the situation is as bad there as it is here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is reassuring, to some extent, but also dangerous. Imagine what the Balaur or Lepharists could do with the full resources of Elysea at their disposal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But never mind that now. I am gratified to see you return. This must mean that the mission has been fulfilled.</p>

          <p>Very wise. With energy like Drana lurking about, even the most minor nuisance can become a deadly threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We still know little about the three Kerubs you just defeated. Hopefully they have no powers that will allow them to return.</p>

          <p>You have gone above and beyond the call of duty this time, [%username]. Accept this with my solemn gratitude.</p>
