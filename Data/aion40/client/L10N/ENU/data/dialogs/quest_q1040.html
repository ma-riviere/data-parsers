          <p>Our enemies in Eltnen are not made solely of flesh and bone, [%username], but wind, dust and heat too. We're threatened not just from all sides, but from all aspects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look around, speak to the others. We have already surrendered villages to the desert; we have already surrendered villages to the Manduri.</p>

          <p>The Krall, of course. Mabangtah and his methods have been cast aside, and Saendukal now reigns supreme in the Kaidan Krall encampments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is a vicious creature, but knows his tools well. First, words; stirring anger in the simple Krall minds. Second, passion; such bloody single-mindedness infects those around him with unbridled fury.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Saendukal stirs a war drum in the heartbeats of his Krall, and still we know almost nothing of their intentions. Their scouts watch us constantly though, which is more than enough cause for concern.</p>

          <p>We do not know why they watch us, or what they have learned. Killing them now, before they are able to report back to Saendukal, will reduce the Krall's advantage.</p>
