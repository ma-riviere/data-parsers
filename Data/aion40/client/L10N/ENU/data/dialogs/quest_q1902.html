          <p>Not all Elyos weapons are made to be sold, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Walk these halls and you'll see weapons that you couldn't buy for all the Kinah in the world. These are companion weapons, built by their owners with the finest materials they could get their hands on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Crafting your own weapon is something you should strive for, [%userclass]. When you understand your tools, you will be a better Daeva for it. In time, as you become skilled, you may even learn to make better weapons than any you could hope to buy in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>Of course. It is a natural part of one's ascension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The very best Daevas, the most ferocious, are skilled weaponsmiths themselves. They've made their reputations with their own blades at their sides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I'm sure you're not here simply to talk about weapons. You wish to learn the art of Weaponsmithing, don't you?</p>

          <p>Very well. Now, creating a weapon is no simple feat. It requires hard work, dedication, time, and knowledge. Many Daeva falter when they realize just how much effort is required.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First you must make an ingot. This is a simple block of metal that you will later need to process to create your first weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Feel up to the task, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Now, go to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA18_4] and gather several samples of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_81j]. When you have enough ore, come back and make me three steel ingots using the crafting table here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and remember, you'll need Charcoal Briquettes to create steel ingots! You should collect extras, just in case you fail in your first attempts.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Congratulations are in order, my friend! However, let's not get carried away. This proves little, other than a willingness to learn. There are many greater challenges along the path you have just started on.</p>
