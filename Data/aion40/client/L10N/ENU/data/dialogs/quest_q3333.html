          <p>This used to be such a lovely place, but a drought has turned it into this barren wasteland.</p>

          <p>Did you see the Mystic Spring on your way up? It's practically a dust bowl.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's hard to visualize how lush this area once was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These days it's just a dry and treacherous lump of mountains.</p>

          <p>The Virago Robbers. People get mesmerized by their plumage and stand there like fools.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hard to get convince everyone to take them seriously...until the beasts stop fluffing their feathers and start attacking.</p>

          <p>Thank you. That's a weight off my shoulders.</p>

          <p>If you could eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HarpyHard_32_An]s on the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_I1] path, that would help considerably.</p>

          <p>Thank you! Normally, I'd have just issued an advisory to keep travelers away, but this is one of the sites along the Great Pilgrimage, so that's not an option.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I'll have some time to finish studying this book. I'm sure I'll find a Virago repellent recipe or something in here, if I just keep reading....</p>
