          <p> </p>
          <p>Something's been bothering me ever since I read through it. Specifically, the part where Hippolytus forces Philipemos to hand over the Life Stone for his "experiment."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What in Vaizel's name could a Lepharist Revolutionary need a Life Stone for? This, combined with the incident in the Library of the Sages, really has me concerned.</p>

          <p>Ah yes...er, this is something of a secret, so...you know...keep it between us.</p>

          <p>The Library was raided. Whoever it was managed to render all the guards and Daevas present unconscious. When our guards awoke, they searched the Library but hardly anything had been touched.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only one book was missing: a very old and precious tome called "Rules of Alchemy and of Life." We need to retrieve the book before they use the secrets within against us. Are you in?</p>
