          <p>The creatures of the forest are becoming victims of this vicious contamination. More and more are affected each day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one comes here anymore, and it's hardly surprising. Who wants to go for a peaceful walk in the glade when ravenous mutants lurk in the shadows all around?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to do something! We must stop the poisoning of the forest...before it's too late....</p>

          <p>The Giant Rakeclaw Frillnecks, Venomous Arachnas, and Glade Plumas seem to be the creatures most affected. You may want to help them, but don't be fooled. They're very dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have recently been stung, which means I can't collect the samples I need. If I could analyze them, I could get to the bottom of all this.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you collect samples for me, Daeva?</p>

          <p>Thank you. You are a friend of the forest. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to hunt Giant Rakeclaw Frillnecks, Venomous Arachnas, and Glade Plumas. This is the only way to get the samples I'll need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need at least 10 to make any progress in my research.</p>
