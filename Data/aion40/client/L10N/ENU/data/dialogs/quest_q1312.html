          <p>Thanks to your hard work, we can now start to look at reforesting Eltnen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Phomona was right. Her faith in Lady Yustiel was well founded. The springs were the key and Eltnen is not lost. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many days are ahead of us before we can expect a renewed forest, but we are on the path to that future.</p>

          <p>Here are some of the altered seeds. If you take them to her, not only will she know the results of the study, but she can arrange for more.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a lesson for all Elyos, [%username]: without due diligence and faith, an entire region would have been lost. Not to the Asmodians, not to the Balaur, but to apathy.</p>

          <p>Your efforts here have won Elysea a prize equal to any we strive for in the Abyss. We have won our homelands back.</p>
