          <p>I got up early this morning to put out her food, and she didn't come running like she always does.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought she was hiding somewhere, but I called her and she didn't come. I looked and looked, but there was no sign of her anywhere.</p>

          <p>Well, Alto told me he saw her waddling off toward the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA13].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What if the Kobolds took her?! They'll eat anything. They probably cook each other when they're low on food. They wouldn't hesitate to kill a poor little Porgus!</p>

          <p>But I have this feeling like she's still alive. Will you find her for me?</p>
