          <p>We really clipped the Ellies' wings when we captured siel's Eastern Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After losing the battle, they set up a bind point on the Island of Exile and deployed their Gray Wind Legionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't THINK they can do much harm with only a few Guardians and a Tower...</p>

          <p>Well, we haven't taken action so far because they aren't much of a threat. But things have changed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They started taking supplies bound for the fortress, and more recently they've attacked every Asmodian who passes near their tower. It's just a matter of time before they build the courage to attack the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want them dealt with before things get worse, but all my Legionaries are occupied defending the fortress. Will you help [%username]?</p>

          <p>They have a bind point on the Island of Exile protected by an Guard Tower. Stationed there are Gray Wind Legionaries called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Laius], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rodementhes], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Salii], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Satyr], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ruth].</p>
