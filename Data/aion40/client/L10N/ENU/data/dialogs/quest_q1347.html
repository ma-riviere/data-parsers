          <p>Eltnen hosts many mysteries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's the vast Underground Temple, its purpose still unknown, and its artifacts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not all. There are its creatures. If you have seen a Klaw, you may understand what I mean.</p>

          <p>Unlike most crustaceans, the Klaw are unnervingly smart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I often sense a purpose behind their movements, a kind of collective intelligence.</p>

          <p>I doubt they're simple beasts, and that's what worries me.</p>

          <p>They have started raiding our outpost, but they seem to pounce the moment we lower our guard, during meals or shift changes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're certainly clever enough to be a nuisance.</p>

          <p>Right, there are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1_30_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1_32_An]s. If you start killing them, I think they'll get the hint.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry about finding them. Klaws are almost everywhere in the Western Eracus Desert.</p>

          <p>After finishing your mission, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Trillian]. I left the Klaw matter in his hands. He will give you whatever else you need.</p>
