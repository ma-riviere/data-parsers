          <p>That booklet you brought last time did help us, but there's more to learn. We don't know how it works.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The high level Stigma test was successful but I've made no new progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've studied the booklet, though, and gleaned a few clues.</p>

          <p>According to the booklet, the Shulacks engraved Stigma on their bodies by using a Drana Fragment. Drana might only be found in Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not completely impossible to lay our hands on it, though. We may meet success if you journey to Dark Poeta!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must have heard the rumors. It's a region that exists in a distorted time, and ruled by the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Vergelmir's conjecture is accurate. You can get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q4936a] by killing Drakan in Dark Poeta.</p>
