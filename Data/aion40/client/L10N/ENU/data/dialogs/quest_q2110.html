          <p>I wish [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Motgar] was here. I'd wring his neck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We sent him out to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_13] a few weeks ago. His laziness was getting intolerable here. He's the sort who won't lift a finger unless you stand right behind him and scream in his ear. Not exactly the Asmodian way, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd go yell at him again, but I've got too much to do here. Our armorer, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dalot], can't do his job because Motgar won't get him the sap he needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait...you're [%username], right?</p>

          <p>Aha! I heard you were Vanar's lackey for a while. Glad to see you've moved on. That Vanar is useless, sitting there in his tent and cursing the darkness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it true he sent Tobu a fruit basket? Not exactly the sort of gift a real raider like Tobu appreciates.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, [%username]...the best way to earn some prestige with us and catch Ulgorn's eye is to volunteer. There's always one more thing to do, eh?</p>

          <p>I figured you would. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Motgar] needs another dose of old-fashioned yelling to get him extracting sap again. And I'm too busy sortin' out the camp defenses to run back and forth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you "convince" him to get back to work? He's in the Munihele Forest</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It should be easy. Motgar is meek, and he'll fold like a shirt when you get in his face.</p>

          <p>I know you haven't been with us long, but you're starting to walk and talk like a raider. That'll help you with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Motgar].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, the message: Tell him that I need three buckets of sap in two days. Our new recruits need armor, so it's vital we receive the sap soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If he fails, he'll be dancing with the ghosts this time next week. You can tell him that too, if you think it'll get results out of him.</p>
