          <p>I've been thinking, [%username]. Knocking off the Mosbears one by one isn't going to solve the problem. It's a temporary solution at best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need something that will take care of the problem on a more permanent level. I think the best way to really get at this issue will be to take out their leader.</p>

          <p>I did mention him before. That new leader of theirs seems to be what's gotten them all so suddenly violent. Eliminate him, eliminate the source of the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How do you feel about taking care of this for me?</p>

          <p>Great. The Mosbear that's taken over is called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearReBigNamedDQ_34_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He lives in a cave in the deepest part of the Mosbear Snowfield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've taken care of him, get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2525a] off him, and bring it back to me.</p>

          <p>Hmm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Really, it's just one more Mosbear. Yes, he's probably a bit tougher, but...it's just one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's fine, though. I'll find someone else. Surely someone will pass by this way.</p>
