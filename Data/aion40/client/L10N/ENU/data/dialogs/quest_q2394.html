          <p>Orlan is determined to go to the Spring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told her it's occupied, but she said there wouldn't be any difference between dying of old age or at the hands of the Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>When she was a child, you see, there were no Lepharist ruffians at the Springs. We went there frequently, as a family.</p>
