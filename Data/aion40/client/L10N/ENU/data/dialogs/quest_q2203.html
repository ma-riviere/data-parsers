          <p>You know, I don't think people understand what's involved in my job. Healing souls is more difficult than it looks. It requires skilled Aether manipulation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Obelisk is what channels the Aether, but I have to direct it. Being Human, I can't handle it perfectly, but I can heal souls well enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's much easier, however, when I have items about my person that contain Aether. I wish I had some with me now.</p>

          <p>Well, I've tried a few different things, but then I happened to discover the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_17]s. They are only found in Altgard Ice Lake, but they contain many [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2203a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2203a]s are known for their high Aether content.</p>

          <p>Well, yes, it would be if it weren't for all the creatures beyond the gate. Not being a Daeva, I haven't a chance of gathering them by myself.</p>
