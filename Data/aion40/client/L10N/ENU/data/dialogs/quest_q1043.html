          <p>After receiving a report that the Kaidan Krall had opened an Abyss Gate, Brigade General Telemachus ordered you to go to the Kaidan Headquarters, meet Mabangtah and ask for his help. Mabangtah gave you a remedy to increase your defenses. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you arrived at the Kaidan Headquarters and went through the Abyss Gate, Kimeia was struggling to stop the Balaur from opening the Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blocking the gate was only a temporary solution...to prevent any further Balaur invasion, it had to be destroyed. The problem was that the Balaur would attack Kimeia while she tried to destroy the gate. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You held off Draconutes and Nagas while she used magic to destroy the gate. You finished the mission successfully and went to Telemachus, who heaped praise on you.</p>
