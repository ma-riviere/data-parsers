          <p>What kind of manastone do you like, [%username]? The Daevas I've met have many different preferences in manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not one for fighting, but I think my favorites are HP manastones. After all, HP helps you stay alive longer in combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But have you noticed how everyone uses their favorite manastones, while the rest just sit around in their cube?</p>

          <p>So the Manastone Removers Association will exchange unused manastones for a new one, and use the old ones for research. It's like killing two birds with one stone. Get it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each manastone remover is assigned to collect different stones. I can exchange MP +50, Evasion +10, and Parry +18 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have those, bring them to me, [%username]. I'll exchange them for a better one.</p>

          <p>Enhancing new weapons and armor with your manastones is one of the greatest pleasures in life, don't you agree?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know some Daevas who always keep their favorite manastones in their cubes. That way they can enhance a new weapon or piece of armor as soon as they get one. Of course the manastones just sit there until they get a new item.</p>
