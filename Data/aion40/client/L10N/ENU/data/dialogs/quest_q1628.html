          <p>They tell me she's going to die. They say there's nothing I can do except to make her comfortable and care for her in her last days. I can't accept that.</p>

          <p>One of the Daevas of Medicine said there's a concoction from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SeirenReD_46_Ae]s that's been known to cure this illness. The Seirens seem to have vanished from Elysea, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They do apparently still exist in Asmodae. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm my mother's only caretaker. I might be able to get someone to watch over her for a short while, but certainly not as long as it would take to get to Asmodae and back.</p>

          <p>It galls me to ask for help, but I must. Could...will you help me save my mother? Will you get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1554b]s for me?</p>

          <p>I haven't been able to pinpoint the location of the Seirens in Asmodae. My next stop, though, was to ask Admiral [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gorgos]. No one in Elysea knows more about Asmodae than him. If you go see him, he can probably point you in the right direction. </p>

          <p>So that's what she's after, is it? That's quite a tall order. And you're going to help her? Well, at least you're not lacking for bravery. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are Seirens in Beluslan, near a place called Alukina's Palace... beautiful place, or at least it was once upon a time, for all it's in shade-cursed Asmodae. I tried to get inside once, but the shadow-blasted thing is sealed. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some kind of Aetheric Field holds it closed. It's a dim shame. Probably won't ever make it back there myself. You might want to ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erato], actually. If there's a bit of shady magic that exists on Atreia, she probably knows something of it. Ask her your questions. </p>

          <p>Alukina's Palace is in Asmodae, but I suspect you know at least that much already. I seem to recall...yes. Yes. There's some sort of magic laid upon it.... Pfah. It's been too long. I'll have to go look in my records.</p>
