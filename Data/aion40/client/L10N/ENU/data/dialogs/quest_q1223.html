          <p>You might think of me as unethical, [%username], for selling Elyos manastones at a profit. Especially since they may one day end up in the hands of our enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I am an Elyos at heart, and don't you ever forget it. I always make certain...changes to the manastones before they leave my hands, so they'll never be as potent as they should be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of which, I need MP +30, Evasion +6, and Parry +14 manastones for a big order I need to fill. I'll reward you better for bundles of 10 of each. Have any? Can you get some?</p>

          <p>I'm glad you continue to support the M.R.A., Daeva. Kinah makes Aion go 'round.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, let me see those MP +30, Evasion +6, and Parry +14 manastones, will you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they're to my liking, I'll reward you with some real nice military-grade manastones I got from a high-up Daeva in Sanctum.</p>
