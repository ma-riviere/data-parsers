		<p>Time for a new initiative, apparently!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>It's already started, as it happens. The Seraphim Lords have started granting the longest serving Daevas [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Pccafe_eventitem]s that prove their dedication to the Elyos cause. Stay in service for a solid hour, and you'll receive a scroll automatically.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If you have some, bring them to me and I'll exchange them for some pretty little rewards. I can accept them on their own, or in bundles of three.</p>
