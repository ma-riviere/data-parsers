          <p>Finally, it's the Ascension Festival! When you're this excited, each year seems like a Daeva's lifetime.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at me--I was born for this! I celebrate all the festivals, but I love this one the most. Do you know its origin?</p>

          <p>Back when Daevas first started ascending, the whole city would celebrate, but now there are so many that we've designated a special day to mark all the ascensions that took place during the year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This year, something really special has started happening. So many Daevas have ascended that the Ascension Energy has started crystallizing into tangible form. Maybe you've even noticed some appearing in your cube, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To enjoy the festival properly, head to the big city. The people, the gift boxes...you can't beat it!</p>

          <p>What? No festival for you? But why?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must be sick. I hear Ribbit Disease can make you stop liking fun. You should get yourself to an apothecary, quick! Or maybe just being exposed to more of the festival's energy will bring you round.</p>

          <p>Look at all these Daevas! I've heard some people complaining about how crowded Sanctum is these days, but I hope more humans ascend. The more, the merrier!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, won't we stand more of a chance in the Abyss War? All these Daevas are good news for the future of Elysea and the Seraphim Lords.</p>
