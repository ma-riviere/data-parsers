          <p>I was overjoyed when I summoned the Great Spirit of Fire, but I knew immediately that something was wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The spirit has a very short life. So far I've kept it alive by slowly feeding it a trickle of energy, but with sufficient [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2], I'll be able to use a different alchemical recipe that will make the Great Spirit of Fire live forever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you bring me ten of each for my experiment?</p>

          <p>Drat! Failed again! Where did I go wrong this time?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I leave the Spirit the way it is now, it may soon disappear. What's worse, the experiment takes so much energy out of me, I can only do it once a day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've brought me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2] I asked you for, right?</p>

          <p>Thank you. These are the most important ingredients in my formula.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They contain the condensed energies of ancient Daevas, and are incredibly powerful.</p>

          <p>Please, take this in appreciation.</p>
