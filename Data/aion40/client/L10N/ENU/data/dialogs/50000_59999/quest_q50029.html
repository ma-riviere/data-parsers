          <p>It was my transformation formula that got my brother trapped in that armor. And now I'm lost in a maze of different formulae trying to get him back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't give up, though. I've got to get him back!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you bring me ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]s and ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2]s so that I can test my new formula and restore my brother?</p>

          <p>I've failed again! Transforming souls! Why did I think this was ever a good idea?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I get desperate when I think about what I've done to my own brother, but the tests take a lot out of me, so I can't do more than one a day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've returned, then you must have the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2] I need for today's test.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. These are the two most important ingredients in my transformation formula.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ancient Daevas' pure souls have condensed into these materials, which is what imbues them with power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please take this token of my appreciation.</p>
