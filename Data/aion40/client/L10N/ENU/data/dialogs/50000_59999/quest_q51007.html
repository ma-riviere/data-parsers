          <p>Asmodian Daeva! You understand joys of teamwork, yes yes! Come here--have a problem, and only you can help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ChristmasEvent_Rudolph_dark]s! Supposed to be pulling sleds for Solorius Festival, but Grankers are lazier than ever this year, and just munch grass and look around! We have so many deliveries to make! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can help though, Daeva! Go to Pernon Plaza and attack the stupid Grankers until you have bridles! Then Shugos can summon Grankers and make them work! Only way to save Solorius! You will help, yes?</p>
