          <p>Would you like to make a trade? I think I have something you'll be interested in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My experiments are very advanced alchemy, and I've been generating a lot of failures. Nothing destructive, you understand; actually a lot of my failures are turning out to be quite valuable items, just not what I'm trying to accomplish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2], I will give you the results of any failed experiments I attempt with them. That way, we're both getting something we want.</p>

          <p>You bring six [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_1]s and six [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2]s to me, and I give you any experiments that fail?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you show me the material first? My failed results are probably worth more than the Soul Vigor or Life Essence.</p>

          <p>I never doubted you. This is definitely the Soul Vigor and Life Essence I asked you for.</p>

          <p>In exchange, here's my latest failed test result.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may be something rare and valuable. Or not. Who knows?</p>
