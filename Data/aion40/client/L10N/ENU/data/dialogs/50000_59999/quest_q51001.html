          <p>The heat is getting more intense every year. It's especially bad in cities like Pandaemonium, because of all the stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back before the Cataclysm, there weren't any extremes in weather. I guess that's something else to thank the Elyos and Balaur for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, this can't go on forever. Fortunately, there are efforts going on to try to find a solution.</p>

          <p>It is. I hear [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sihein] discovered a way to turn heat into an actual physical object, called Scorching Heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He mentioned to me that the more he has, the more likely it is that he can use it to find out what to do about the weather.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if he's made any further progress? Maybe you could speak to him and find out.</p>

          <p>Good choice. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sihein] certainly loves summer, so he'll talk your ear off if given the chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the current trends continue, Asmodae could be in serious trouble, so you could be helping us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, what good is victory over the Balaur and Elyos if we're left with a dead world?</p>

          <p>You're going to let the weather keep you from your duty? And you call yourself an Asmodian?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe one of those pale Elyos would wither under the heat, but we can't. There's too much at stake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand it's uncomfortable, and getting worse, but you must push through. This is bigger than just your discomfort.</p>

          <p>Isn't this heat wonderful? The way it drifts off every surface, into your every pore? Of course, too much of even a good thing can be dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's one reason I found a way to coalesce it into Scorching Heat. It's much easier to study and organize when you can see and feel it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's also easier to transport, so I can examine heat from across Asmodae. That's why I helped organize a special event.</p>

          <p>I've spread the magic that creates Scorching Heat across all worlds. That way, anyone can collect them and bring them in for study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To encourage Daevas to do so, I've partnered with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Elma] to give summer-themed rewards in exchange for Scorching Heats.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be sure to talk to her and get yours. Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'll let myself bake in this marvelous warmth a while more....</p>
