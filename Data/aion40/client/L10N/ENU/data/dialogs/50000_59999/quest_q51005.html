          <p>Oooh, you look like a pretty experienced Daeva, [%username]. Let me see...you must have ascended about [%userlevel] years ago? Wasn't it about then that I saw your ascension ceremony?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must be excited about the Ascension Festival we're throwing this year. Have you heard about it?</p>

          <p>I really wish I could have been there back in the old days. I mean, it must have been a party every week. Every time anyone ascended! Imagine that!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, yeah, these days it would be too much. We all have work to do, Elyos to fight, you know? So we've put it all into one big annual festival. But those must have been good times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen the cake yet? It's in Pandaemonium...they say it's HUGE! You should definitely check it out.</p>

          <p>Of course, cake isn't the only notable thing about this year's festival. Maybe you've started seeing Ascension Energy accumulating in your cube? This weird thing's started happening where, because there are so many new Daevas this year, the energy of their ascension has taken on tangible form.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DC1_Emma], the Gift Trader in Pandaemonium. She's collecting the energy and giving out really great stuff in return. She learned from the best--her big sis is Elma, who gave out the summer gifts last year.</p>

          <p>Do you remember the hot spell we had? My sister Elma was the one who collected all that summer energy that kept accumulating. She had some plans to use it for warmth in Morheim, but I don't know how she's doing on that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I was so inspired that I've decided to collect the Ascension Energy from this Ascension Festival! You've been accumulating it, right?</p>

          <p>Oh, what a great job you've been doing! Not just gathering this energy, but all your hard work fighting for the glory of Pandaemonium and the Shedim Lords. Daevas like you are what this festival is all about!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't forget to bring me any more energy you manage to acquire.</p>
