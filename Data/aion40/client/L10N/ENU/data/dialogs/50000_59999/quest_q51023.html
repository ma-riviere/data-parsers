		<p>Pandaemonium High Command has started a new initiative, [%username]. They're calling it "Operation: Perseverance". You'll see why.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Essentially, all Daevas are hereby assigned an item for every hour they spend in active service. These items, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Pccafe_eventitem]s, can then be brought back here to me, and exchanged for rewards.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I'm currently accepting single scrolls and bundles of three. If you have 'em, just let me know.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is correct. And here, [%username], is your reward. Use it well.</p>

		<p>Takes quite a bit of effort to collect three of these scrolls, [%username]. Good work, friend.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Now, here's your reward. You'll find the goodies inside rather interesting. You could even say that they'll TRANSFORM your life. They'll certainly WARP your perspective. I just hope you don't find the changes too SCALY.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Okay I'll stop now. If I drop any bigger hints, I'll crush my feet. Just remember to run back if you get any more of those scrolls.</p>

		<p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Pccafe_eventitem]s show High Command how hard you've worked for the Asmodian cause, [%username]. Not only that, but they show our kin your dedication.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>And what greater badge of honor can an Asmodian pin to his chest than the one that represents valor and loyalty to our blood, eh?</p>

		<p>Keep up the good work.</p>
