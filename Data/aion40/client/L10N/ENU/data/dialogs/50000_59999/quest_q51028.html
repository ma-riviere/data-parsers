          <p>Right now Spirit of Fire's life is like a candle, just a flickering flame in the wind. This transformation formula has to work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've done a few trial experiments since I came to Asmodae, and they were rather successful. However, I have to be very careful. Any mistake may make the spirit vanish completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_event_worlddrop_2] in order to perform more precise experiments. Bring me five of them, and I will share alchemy formula with you.</p>

          <p>The other ingredients are classified. Let's just say that I can find them on my own.</p>

          <p>Thank you. This is an excellent Life Essence sample.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this, I can verify my transformation formula with one more experiment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully this works, and I can restore the fizzling spirit. It will be a Great Spirit with a roaring, eternal flame, not just a weak, flickering candle.</p>
