          <p>Knew you Asmodians would help! "What makes me an Asmodian's ally stronger, makes the Asmodian stronger". Famous Shugo phrase, yes yes. But fix one problem, and another pops up! Nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This time, stupid Shugos making trouble! Wasn't just the Grankers relaxing in Pernon Plaza--just heard reports of Shugo Deliverymen doing exactly same thing! Problem is, Granker bridle doesn't fit Shugo. Need another plan. Hmm....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah! Can trap them! Much more humane, yes? If Daeva could go to Pernon again, and send deliverymen to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_HousingDF_Event_SantaShugo], then Solorius should be saved! Genius plan, but will Daeva help?</p>

          <p>Ah! Speaking of presents, have another festival coin for you. Remember, take to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Kebisung_df] for items! And Asmodian--Blood and arms! Right, yes yes?</p>
