          <p>Oh goodie, oh goodie, it's the Ascension Festival! Has it only been a year since we last celebrated all the new Daevas? Feels like forever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ascension Festival is my very favoritest celebration. It has the best history--do you know it?</p>

          <p>Used to be that the ascension of a Daeva was a rare enough occasion that each one was celebrated with a big party. These days there are so many that we celebrate all the year's new Daevas on one special day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's something special in the air this year--can you feel it? There are so many new Daevas that the Ascension Energy has started crystallizing into tangible form. Maybe you've seen them appearing in your cube, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Right here in the big city is where all the people are, and where you can find the most fun. Not to mention the most gift boxes!</p>

          <p>Plus, there'll be more and more to fight on our behalf in the Abyss. Keep up the good work, Daeva!</p>
