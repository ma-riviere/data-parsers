          <p>There are many Artifacts in the Ruins of Roah, which makes it an important point to hold. But whether it be the Balaur or the Asmodians who occupy the fortress, they always deploy their best in the front.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's very difficult to collect information we can use to plan an attack. And the latest news indicates that it may be harder than we thought.</p>

          <p>We obtained information that the elite Asmodian troops carry powerful Kisks, supposedly far superior to what we have now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If true, it's a dangerous development.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need a Daeva to wipe out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1810_all]s in the fortress and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1810a]s for examination.</p>

          <p>You're volunteering? I...well, I didn't expect anyone would be brave enough. I've seen these elite Asmodian troops in combat--they're very skilled. I'd find some allies to go along with you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, yes: The elite Asmodian troops only appear when the Asmodians have taken the fortress, and its much easier to deal with them when the fortress in the Vulnerable State.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1810_all]s and make sure to return with the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1810a]s.</p>
