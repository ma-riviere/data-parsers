          <p>I wish Tyr was here! This is his specialty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's the Aetheric Field Protector for Morheim. He has a lovely, informal attitude--among Daevas and Humans alike--and a deft sense of humor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hates formal procedure and reading paperwork, but I fear....</p>

          <p>I'm not sure. Our local wildlife are....</p>

          <p>Well...animal attacks are rising. And they're violent, as well. And animals are foraging much closer to town.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much worse and they'll overwhelm our guards, even with the volunteers. But the Fortress has sent all the troops they will. I could use advice.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I've written [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tyr] a report of what's happening. You could take it to him at Morheim Observatory. </p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aether's perturbed, yes, but not badly. It's certainly not so serious as to stir up creatures far down in town! Get it? Perturbed? Stir up? No? Ah, well.</p>

          <p>Poor Rikesh's always been a worry-wart. I'll compose something reassuring for her. Consider your duties here discharged! Be well, and...try to smile!</p>
