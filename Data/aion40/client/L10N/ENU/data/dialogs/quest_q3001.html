          <p>Daeva can be trusted, yes? Is not Daeva of False Hope? Yadamonerk has bad feeling about this.</p>

          <p>Some Shugos are not to be trusted. Tail-twisters! Krall-tongues! Must be hiding relics where honest Shugos cannot see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one will confess such things to Yadamonerk, but a Daeva--who would dare lie to you? You will ask them, yes?</p>

          <p>Yes, yes. The Shugos are [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LF2a_2] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LF2a_5].</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Ten days is nine too many with empty hands, nyerk. No Shugo will admit false trading to another, but to a Daeva....</p>

          <p>If you ask to buy, they will surely try to sell you relics, yes? Yadamonerk's life is worth more than his Kinah, but Daeva has both in hands. Please help!</p>
