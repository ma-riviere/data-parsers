          <p>The final stage of your testing for duty in the Abyss will directly test your ability to complete missions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many Daevas think the Abyss is nothing but aimless conflict...a continuous fray into which they can leap at will, but that kind of thinking will get you killed.</p>

          <p>The Abyss will surely test your combat skills, but the success of your missions will often depend on more than just your ability to kill enemy soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must also have patience, courage, and diligence. We will test these attributes by sending you on a prepared mission.</p>
