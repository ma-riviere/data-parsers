          <p>The Balaur have been having their way with Beluslan for nearly a month now. It's time to stop them once and for all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got the Aetheric Field up and running again at least, but we can't get it back to full strength.</p>

          <p>You took out the devices that were suppressing the Observatory's field, but it turned out their plan was much larger-scale than that--they're trying to bring the Aetheric Field down across all Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_AntiOdTower_Q2061] before the whole field collapses. It's a big, big, job, and that calls for big, big bombs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sent a message to Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Votan] in Primum Landing requesting some heavy ordnance. Go get those bombs and then report back to me and I'll tell you what needs exploding and killing.</p>

          <p>You've got about five seconds until that bomb goes off, and you don't want to be there when that happens.</p>

          <p>Nerita ordered you to begin driving the Balaur out of Asmodae once and for all. The first step was to restore the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to the Abyss to pick up the Aether Bombs to destroy the Balaur devices suppressing the field, then to Draupnir Cave, where you met up with Fafner the spy. He told you to destroy the Aether-consuming Stones with the bombs, then kill Deputy Brigade General Yavant to take down the Aetheric Field Suppressing Device.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You fought your way through the cave slaughtering the Balaur and destroying the devices, then met with Governor Vidar of Pandaemonium, who personally congratulated you on your glorious victory.</p>
