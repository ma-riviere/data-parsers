          <p>Greetings, Daeva. I'm Cadoc of the Manastone Removers Association...the Beluslan union division.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, we're now unionized, as you've probably heard. Budget shortfalls, lack of Pandaemonium funding, recessions...and that invasion on Balaurea really didn't help matters much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the manastone removers formed their own business entity. Need a job? Feel like earning yourself some brand new manastones?</p>

          <p>For this special deal I'm offering, I'll only deal in bulk orders--bundles of 10.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm looking for HP +50, Accuracy +18, and Block +18 manastones...10 of each, so 30 total. Then I'll reward you with this pouch of new ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might even have them in your warehouse or cube, if you want to look real quick....</p>
