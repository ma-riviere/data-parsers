          <p>I think the real reason we're way out on the frontier is Artifacts: not just one, but many.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eltnen is crawling with Artifacts...like the ones in the Abyss, we think. If we master the Artifacts here, that might give us an edge in the Abyss War, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've just received a sketchy report from the Outpost Ruins. Something about the flow of Aether disappearing completely....</p>

          <p>Not necessarily. There are always strange fluctuations in Aether flow nearby. But it bears investigating, that's for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But troops are in short supply--look around you, eh?--and I don't want to send a raw recruit out there. When an Artifact is involved, you never know what might turn up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Based on what I've heard you do in Verteron, I think you've got the experience to check it out for me, [%username].</p>

          <p>Meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lakaias] first. He's the guard for the Outpost Ruins.</p>

          <p>Yah! You surprised me. Sorry--I was deep in thought.</p>

          <p>Centurion Valerius must have sent you. You're here about the Aether, right?</p>

          <p>With all the refugees coming through here, I haven't examined the site firsthand, so I'm not sure what's up. The Outpost Ruins makes me...nervous, to be honest. Helping the refugees as they come through...now that's something straightforward where I can be useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My guess is that the Artifact must have received some kind of physical shock. But that's just a guess. Nothing like seeing for yourself, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get there, you'll see ruined buildings in several places--they all look alike to me. The Artifact is inside one of them.</p>
