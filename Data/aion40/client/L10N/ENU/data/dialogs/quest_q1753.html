       <p>[%username], welcome back! I wanted to ask you for another quick favor.</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>I'm not sure if I told you before, but I send the minerals I collect here on to Teminon Landing to make weapons.</p>
       <p> </p>
       <p>Any new types I discover go straight to Sanctum for research.</p>

          <p>Oh, yes! There are many types that I've never seen in Atreia. Especially in the Sulfur Archipelago, where more minerals are buried than other places.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's hard to get to them all due to [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_RottenTreeB_29_An]s. They say that the effect of the Abyss is what changed Elim into Embers.</p>

          <p>Ah, no. I mean, we need minerals, but while you get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_RottenTreeB_29_An]s wandering around, we'll collect them.</p>
          <p> </p>
