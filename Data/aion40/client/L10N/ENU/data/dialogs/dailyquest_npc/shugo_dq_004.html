          <p>Ooh, my sensitive Shugo ears hear jingling of Daemon Tokens, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can hear tokens jingling from ten meters away! Some think that is sad, but I am proud of my skill!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many tokens mean many jobs for Charlirunerk's Daemons are getting done! That always makes me happy! So do you want your rewards?</p>

          <p>So, you are interested in Charlirunerk's Daemons, huh? It is no surprise--all the strong Daevas want to be a Daemon. It means big adventures and big rewards, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to know how to join or leave the Daemons, talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DQ_005]. If you want to trade in for rewards, I cannot help you. You need to talk to someone else.</p>
