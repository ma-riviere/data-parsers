          <p>Tokens burning a hole in your pocket? How about a nice shield?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not everyone appreciates shields. There's a whole sun-addled generation that's grown up not appreciating the "sword and board" style of fighting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These polearm-obsessed feeblies look at me like I'm sun-blighted when I mention shields. They better not come cryin' to me when they get an arm lopped off.</p>

          <p>I wish I could help you, [%username]. But wings don't make a qooqoo a Daeva, and good intentions don't make you a valued customer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you were a Warden, then we could do business. But as much as I hate to say it, you should probably go see that blasted [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just don't let him fill your head with funny ideas. Everyone needs a shield. In fact, everyone should have two. One for each arm.</p>
