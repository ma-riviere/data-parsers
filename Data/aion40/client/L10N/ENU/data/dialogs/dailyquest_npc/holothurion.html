          <p>Greetings!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a dangerous world out there. Are you properly prepared for the challenges ahead?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If not, why not spend some tokens? Take a look at what I have to offer. A Field Warden must always be ready for whatever comes!</p>

          <p>Sorry, but I can't help you. You'll have to talk to another reward officer to spend your tokens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're not a member of my faction, you'll have to join up first. Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan if you're interested.</p>
