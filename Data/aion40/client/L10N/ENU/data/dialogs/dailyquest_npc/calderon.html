          <p>You looking to join Radiant Operations? We're recruiting for a few skilled Daevas to help us take on the shade-cursed Asmodians and Balaur. Sound interesting? Hmm...?</p>

          <p>Radiant Ops is a key part of Sanctum's forces. We operate largely autonomously, which gives us more...flexibility...in our approaches to preventing the Drakenclawed from disrupting Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We work discreetly in small groups, or alone, to make quick and decisive strikes at the heart of the enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to join us, you can join at any time. I think you'll find that our terms of service are very flexible. You'll just need to pass a physical, a background check, sign our non-disclosure agreement...</p>
