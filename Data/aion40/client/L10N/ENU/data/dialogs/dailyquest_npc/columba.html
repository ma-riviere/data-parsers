          <p>Everyone claims the Beluslan Fortress is safe, but it's really not. Some days I wonder if the sky isn't really falling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess that's not entirely fair, though. Compared to the rest of Beluslan, this place is practically unassailable, especially with the Field Wardens about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate being cooped up like a qooqoo, but I'll tell you what.... I wouldn't be caught dead wandering around outside these walls, not for a key to the Temple of Gold.</p>
