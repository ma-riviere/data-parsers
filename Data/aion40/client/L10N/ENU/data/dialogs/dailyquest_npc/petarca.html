          <p>Lord Marchutan charged The Circle to guide younger Daevas to their destinies.</p>

          <p>The Circle is named for the careful, but firm, guidance that perpetuates an endless loop.</p>

          <p>Remember those who helped you when you belonged to the Marchutan Priory? They may very well have been of The Circle.</p>

          <p>The newly ascended become stronger. Then they join The Circle and help the newly ascended in turn. Thus does Asmodae's strength grow.</p>
