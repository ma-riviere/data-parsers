          <p>It's good to see a freshly arrived member of the Alabaster Order. The more people we have, the less we must leave to chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A lot's getting left to chance these days, which is why we put so much faith in our blessed status right now. Too much faith. But if Aion hadn't called us, we'd probably be a dead order by now.</p>
          <p> </p>
