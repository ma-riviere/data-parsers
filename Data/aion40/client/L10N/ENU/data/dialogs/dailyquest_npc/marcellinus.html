          <p>Most Fortuneers know the value of armor. It's how we survived to form the group, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes I wonder what it's like to be a Mage, and have your armor actually increase your offensive capability....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, here's what I've got. See anything you think is worth your Fortuneers Tokens?</p>
