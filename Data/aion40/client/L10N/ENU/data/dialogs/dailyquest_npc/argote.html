          <p>I only recently joined the Alabaster Order, but I think this is the place for me.</p>

          <p>It just seems so free of politics and tension. Just the righteous helping others.</p>

          <p>Oops, should get back to work. Do you have Progress Tokens to trade in?</p>

          <p>Sorry, I don't think I can help you. I can only work with certain Alabaster Order members.</p>
