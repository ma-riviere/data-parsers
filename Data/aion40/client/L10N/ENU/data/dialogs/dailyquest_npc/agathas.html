          <p> </p>
          <p>It looks like you've come for a reward? I can see that glimmer of fortune in your eyes. If you have the proper amount of Fortuneers Tokens, I'll get the process moving along.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're here about registering with the Fortuneers or, Vaizel forbid, leaving our legion for another, you'll have to speak with our captain, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos]. He's got the eye for that sort of thing, not me.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. It looks like you need something....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're here to see about getting your reward, make sure I'm the steward you need to be speaking with. Different levels require different stewards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're here to find out if you can join the Fortuneers Legion, you'll have to go and see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos]. I hope to Vaizel that you're not here to leave us. Our captain does not take to deserters very well. They're still trying to find the last Fortuneer who wanted to retire from his duties.</p>
