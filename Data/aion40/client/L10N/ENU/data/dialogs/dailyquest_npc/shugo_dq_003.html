          <p>If Daevas not bragging about how many Elyos they kill, they are bugging me about how to join Charlirunerk's Daemons. I keep having to tell them, talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DQ_005]! I wish they would listen, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you seem different. You have tokens, so I can do my job! Do you want to trade in yours?</p>

          <p>Let me guess: you are yet another Daemon who wants to join Charlirunerk's Daemons, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I told the Daeva before you, and the Daeva before him, and the Daeva before her, I cannot register you to be Daemon. You have to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DQ_005], nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you came for rewards, that is another story, but I cannot help you with that. You need to go elsewhere and talk to another official.</p>
