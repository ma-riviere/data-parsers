          <p>When I was in an Asmodian prison, my armor protected me from the guards' knives and from the felons' questing claws.</p>
          <p> </p>    
          <p>Now that I'm back home, I never take it off. Ever. Would you want to get caught by trogs while wearing only a party outfit?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For a few Orichalcum Tokens, you can have the same grade stuff as mine.</p>
