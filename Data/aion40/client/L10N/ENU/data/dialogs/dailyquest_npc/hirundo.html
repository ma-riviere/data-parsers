          <p>You never know what's out there. Field Wardens must be prepared. For what? Who can say?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest a good shield. With just a few Ward Tokens, you'll be prepared for whatever you may face.</p>

          <p>Hmm.... Looks like I can't take your Tokens. You'll have to talk to another reward officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or, talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] to learn more about the Field Wardens. Just don't tell him I sent you.</p>
