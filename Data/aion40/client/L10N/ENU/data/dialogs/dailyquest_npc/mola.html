          <p>I think I see someone who's in need of a new shield. Amirite?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? I just thought...from the scars. Not that you're not a great warrior! I'm sure you can fight! And that scar looks good on you! And I'm babbling, aren't I?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Point is, if you need a shield, I'll trade you one for some tokens. If you've got other business, maybe one of the other girls can help you.</p>

          <p>Ok, listen. [%username], is it? I can't help you. Do I have a big sign over my head that says "Information"? No. So you need to find help elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have Ward Tokens, we can talk. If you don't, or you're not a Warden, then you have to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum]. He's quite helpful and nice, actually. I think you'll like him. I do.</p>

          <p>Would you like me to walk you over there...?</p>
