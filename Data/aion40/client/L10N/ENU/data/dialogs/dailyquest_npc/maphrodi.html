          <p>How droll. Another Daeva who comes to me out of curiosity about what I can give, not from friendship or Alabaster Order camaraderie.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, no. Don't try to lie about why you're here. That only makes it worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please just hand over your Progress Tokens, so I can give you your armor reward and be done.</p>

          <p>There's no sense of friendship these days. No interest in it, either. Only duty and self-gratification.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only these selfish Daevas didn't try to put up their facades. At least they'd have the virtue of being honest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, I can't take your Tokens. See another steward, or President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] for membership. Now leave me be.</p>
