          <p>You know the old phrase "Speak softly and carry a sharp greatsword"?</p>  
          <p> </p>  
          <p>That's what The Circle does: speak softly to its charges, but slice through those who oppose Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>    
          <p>My job is more literal, though I carry more than greatswords. Take a look.</p>
