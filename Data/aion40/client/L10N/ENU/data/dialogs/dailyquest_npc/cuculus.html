          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. Do you have tokens to spend? I'd be happy to take them off your hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'd rather save up for a while, I guess I couldn't hold that against you. There's some value in being thrifty, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, a pocket full of tokens won't do you any good when you're floating in the Abyss, will it? Whereas a nice sword, or shield, or some armor....</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, [%username]. I can't help you if you're not a Field Warden. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan can help you out if you need more details on how to sign up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might also try the new guy, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cornix]. I can't say much about him, but he seems...decent. I suppose.</p>
