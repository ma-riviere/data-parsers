          <p>The Wrights of Dawn are demanding, that's for sure. The items they request are more intricate than your average pieces. But you know? It's so worth it when you see the final piece.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Wright's Tokens they give out are rewards for crafting such items with great skill, and you can use them to buy things. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only accept Wright's Tokens, but rest assured, I sell only top-quality items.</p>
