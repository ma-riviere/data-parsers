          <p>The Alabaster Order is intimately concerned with the well-being of all its members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Part of it is self-interest, of course; healthy members are productive members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So take a good look at the armor I have to offer. If you have the Progress Tokens, I suggest you spend them.</p>

          <p>I think there's been a misunderstanding. I can't exchange your Tokens. You should talk to another rewards officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you wish to join the Alabaster Order, I can't do that either. That's for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] to decide.</p>
