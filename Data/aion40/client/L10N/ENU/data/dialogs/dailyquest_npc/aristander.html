          <p>How is life under the sun, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've got your Fortuneers Tokens there, I've got your reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you have questions about registering with the Fortuneers Legion, you'll have to find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos] and ask him. Just a warning: our captain's not the warmest person in these parts.</p>

          <p>Please enter /petition in your Chat window and inform a GM.</p>

          <p>I suppose you're here because you wanted to join the finest fortune hunting legion in all of Elysea, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why are we the finest, you ask? Because we fight hard and we celebrate even harder. We're the fairest as well as the fiercest! We even reward our Fortuneers for dutifully completing their quests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am guessing, [%username], that's why you're here. So you'll have to find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos] and speak with him.</p>
