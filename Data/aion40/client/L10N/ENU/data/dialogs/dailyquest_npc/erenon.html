          <p>Oh, wow. This is embarassing. So sorry, but we can't admit anyone who's already joined another organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it were up to me, you'd be in like a flash, [%username]. But that would step on the toes of other organizations and cause unwanted trouble.</p>

          <p>If you leave your current organization, the Wrights of Dawn can take you with no problem. So if you truly want to join us, you should first formally withdraw from that other organization.</p>
