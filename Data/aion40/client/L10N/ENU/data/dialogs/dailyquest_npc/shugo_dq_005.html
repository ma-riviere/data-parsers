          <p>Bah, all Daevas want to. But not all can. We did not become top agency by hiring any dummy who ascends.</p>

          <p>If you want to join, join. I can't do anything about it, nyerk. But hurry it up. My time just as valuable as yours!</p>

          <p>Charlirunerk's Daemons hired by only most wealthy and powerful clients. We do everything. Well, nothing shady! We have trust of leaders of Pandaemonium, you know.</p>
