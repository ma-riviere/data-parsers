          <p>Blood for blood. How goes the fight?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd rather be wearing your wings than my own. I'm stuck here handing out weapons while you're out there using them. Shards! This is why I left Pandaemonium in the first place.</p>

          <p>I know, I know.... Fate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, if you're looking for arms, I'm your man. Otherwise, you'll have to move on.</p>

          <p>If you're not qualified to register with the Wardens, you'll need to have a chat with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum]. I'd walk you over to meet him, but I'd be too tempted to tear his mane off. Smug, sun-addled little....</p>
