          <p>You know, a good shield can make the difference between collecting another bounty and paying a Soul Healer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look like you've been doing good work, though. I hope you realize that by now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take a look at these shields. If one catches your eye, you'll find it's well worth the Fortuneers Tokens.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I can't take your Tokens. You'll have to find another reward officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or you can just join the Fortuneers. Captain [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anitos] will help you with that.</p>
