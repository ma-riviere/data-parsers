          <p>It's always interesting to see what Alabaster Order members buy with their Tokens, and how they react, especially if it's a bundle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some open theirs so eagerly, you'd think they were a child on Solorious morning!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What will you buy, and how will you treat your new prize? I'm eager to find out!</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I can't help you with your Tokens. You'll have to talk to another rewards officer, or to President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] if you wish to join.</p>
