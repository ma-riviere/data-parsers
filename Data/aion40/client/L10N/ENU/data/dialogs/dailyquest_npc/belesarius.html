          <p>For Elysea and Glory!</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>I've heard you'd earned a rather nice pile of Radiant Tokens, [%username]. You've obviously been putting those wings to good use. Are you looking to exchange those Tokens for supplies?</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>I can help you with the Tokens, but if you're looking for the low down on joining or leaving Radiant Ops, you'll need to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Calderon], the Radiant Ops Recruitment Officer.</p>

          <p>I'd love to help you out, but different officers deal with different levels of Tokens and I'm not authorized to handle these beauties. You'll need to visit one of the other Stewards.</p>

          <p>Oh, and if you're looking for more information about Radiant Ops, go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Calderon]. He's always happy to talk about it, ad nauseam.</p>
