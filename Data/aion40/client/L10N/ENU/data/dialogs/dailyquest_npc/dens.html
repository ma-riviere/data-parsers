          <p>Hello there, [%userclass]. Are you here for a reward? I've got them, but only if you've got tokens. I don't give anything away for free. Not usually. But I don't know you nearly well enough to make an exception. Yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know, you have an honest face, but I've gotten burned before. Last time was with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum], the Field Warden Registrar over in Beluslan. Ask him about it, next time you're over there chatting about registrations and terminations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, don't. I don't want to give him the satisfaction of thinking I still care.</p>

          <p>Hey there, [%username]. What brings you to my scrawny neck of Asmodae?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm.... I don't know if I can help you with your problem, [%username]. After all, no one seems to handle my problems. Last time I had a problem, what happened? I wound up here, that's what happened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, if your problem is that you're not a Field Warden, then I've got a solution. His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum], and he works over in Beluslan. And if you see him, you tell him I'm loving it here in Gelkmaros.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>But when you say it, try to make it sound like the truth.</p>
