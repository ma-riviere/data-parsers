          <p>Sorry, Daeva. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DQ_005] will be mad at me if I take your tokens. And you do not want her mad at you, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Either see another reward officer, or talk to Tikalanerk about joining Daemons. Just do not offend her, if you know what is good for you....</p>
