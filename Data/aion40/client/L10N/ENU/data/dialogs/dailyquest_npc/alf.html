          <p>They're good people, but I just don't relate well to my fellow Circle members. I feel very isolated.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>They're aloof, like kitters.... Mmmmm, kitters.</p> 
          <p> </p>          
          <p>So...how about a weapon in exchange for Circle Tokens?</p>

          <p>I hate kitters. Well, I love them on a dinner plate.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>What? I'm rambling? I think that's because I can't do anything to help you right now.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>I recommend talking to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Petarca] in Pandaemonium about The Circle before we speak again.</p>
