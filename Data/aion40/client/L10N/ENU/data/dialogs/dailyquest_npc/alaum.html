          <p>How are things out in the rest of Brusthonin? I wouldn't really know. I've been stuck here for...well I'm not sure how long. Seems like half of forever. It's a nice little...village...place. But I sure don't want to live here if I can help it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to have a nice place in Morheim. Of course, I don't need to tell you how that went bad. Fire, sand, salt, blasted Elyos dead.... It was probably for the best it burned to the ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ironically, if I still lived there I could glide to work at the Observatory every day, it would have been so close. Oh well...we all walk the path Fate has set for us, I suppose.</p>
