          <p>President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon] of the Alabaster Order is letting me give out rewards today. Isn't he wonderful? If you need to register for the Alabaster Order, you can go talk to him.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, [%username], but you should really go see a different Steward. Our wonderful President Typhon is having me hand out rewards to certain classes and levels only.... Otherwise, the whole rewards process would get overwhelming. You know how large organizations are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? Some people in Elysea don't know about the Alabaster Order and our dreamy President [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Typhon]? They should go see him to learn more...or just to see him.</p>
