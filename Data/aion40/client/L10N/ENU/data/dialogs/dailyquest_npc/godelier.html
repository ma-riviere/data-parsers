          <p>Despite the way I look now, I was once a mewling, newly ascended Daeva. I was weak, frightened....</p>  
          <p> </p>  
          <p>The Circle helped me, shaded me. They built my skills and self-confidence. I'd be displaced by now if it weren't for them.</p>
          <p> </p>    
          <p>Thus I gladly distribute weapons in their name. It's the least I can do.</p>
