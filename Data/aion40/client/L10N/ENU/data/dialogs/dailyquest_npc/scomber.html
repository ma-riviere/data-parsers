          <p>Azphelumbra, Warden. Looking for some armor?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you got tokens, I got armor. Not as nice as what I'm wearing, of course--it's a family heirloom--but it'll do for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For anything else, you should go chat with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] over there. The lazy bum. We're handling arms and armor, and he's pushing paper. Nice, eh?</p>

          <p>You got Ward Tokens, right? From the Wardens? No? Then I got nothing for you.</p>

          <p>In fact, no Field Warden's gonna help you right now, except maybe [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum]. Go have a chat with him. Make him do some real work for a change.</p>
