          <p>It's been a while since I've have had a run in with the Asmodians. But it's always the same. The Daevas engage in battle, supplies get depleted, everyone gets tired and cranky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What we really need is more Elyos to take an interest. More Daevas to fly in and clear out those troglodytes from the Abyss, Balaurea, and Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here at Radiant Ops, we try to empower individuals to stand up and meet the Asmodians in battle. It's got to be done, so Elysea can flourish.</p>
