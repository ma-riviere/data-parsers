          <p>Have you heard any news about Gelkmaros? I heard that Lord Marchutan has arrived, and that even Lady Lumiel has offered her direct support. It can't be long before Gelkmaros is under the control of the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And while they're on the offensive, the Field Wardens are busy with...other matters. Just as important, of course. Once Gelkmaros is ours, then the Field Wardens will be in a position to...do things...like...build an Aetheric Field Observatory and make peace for Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Things like that.</p>
