          <p>I don't know about this pet craze. Sure, they're useful at times, but can they inflict wounds on Balaur? Haven't met one that can.</p>  
          <p> </p>  
          <p>A good weapon, though.... That's always useful. Take a look at these and pick one that strikes you.</p>
          <p> </p>    
          <p>Oh, and stay away from Breshen. He'll talk your ear off about pets if you let him.</p>

          <p>I'd love to give you some of my weapons--you certainly look like you could use them. But I can't.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>My best advice is to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Petarca] in Pandaemonium about The Circle. Then maybe we can do business.</p>
