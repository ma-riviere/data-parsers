          <p>Are you here on Warden business? I can only help you with that if you're a member, and if you have tokens, and if you want to exchange tokens for a reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For registration--leaving and joining and things like that--you need to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan. People confuse me for him all the time. It must be the mane.</p>

          <p>I know, you have tokens, right? Right. But I can't help you--you need to find a different steward to talk with. I can only help Field Wardens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rostrum] in Beluslan. He's the one in...well, not exactly in charge, per se. No one's in charge--it's more like a cell structure, where each group operates semi-autonomously without...actually....</p>

          <p>From the glazed look in your eyes I can tell you're not exactly interested in that, though. I'll leave you be.</p>
