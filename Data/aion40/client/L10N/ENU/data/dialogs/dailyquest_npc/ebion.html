        <p>Oh, it's you [%username]. Arieluma and all that. I swear, if I don't get away from this outpost soon, my wings are going to atrophy.</p>

          <p>If you've got Radiant Tokens, fork 'em over. I'll see what I can do...</p>

          <p>And, no, I can't help you with Radiant Ops recruitment. You want to talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Calderon]. He's got all the answers. He gets all the good assignments.</p>

          <p>I'd like to help you with those Tokens, but I can't. Nope. Not certified to handle those tokens at this location. You'll need to check with one of the other Stewards. I'm sure one of THEM got certification training...</p>
