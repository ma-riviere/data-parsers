          <p>Superb! First, you have to be formally approved by Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vidar], but that's a formality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll write a recommendation letter post-haste. Take it to Vidar and receive your title, then attend the appointment ceremony!</p>

          <p>Ahh...I always have time to recognize a Daeva's worthy achievements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's time to dedicate your Handicrafting to the Shedim Lords--a privilege enjoyed by few. From now on, I charge you to use your talent to contribute to the development of handicrafts in Pandaemonium. We are an austere people, but our culture and our art are sacred.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lanse] has taught you well. Congratulations, Handicrafts Expert!</p>
