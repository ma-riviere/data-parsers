          <p>Whatever you need, just let me know. I have everything from daggers to maces to spears to spellbooks. Every weapon you could possibly need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find good old-fashioned quality here, no throwaway rubbish. Every blade leaves my shop freshly sharpened. See the gleam from that edge? A thread of sunlight!</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hilts are studded with Crystals. They burn and dazzle like flames. Beautiful, aren't they?</p>

          <p>They come from a local ore. They're translucent, resilient, and perfect for ornamentation. All true Verteron weapons have these Crystals embedded in them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're difficult to get, though. The larger Crystals are embedded so deeply in the earth that you can break your back trying to dig them out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you can dig up [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA76]s pretty easily.</p>

          <p>Absolutely. That's why it's so hard to find Crystal Fragments in the swamp these days. The few that are left are mostly under water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most people in Verteron leave those alone, what with all the creatures living in there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You don't look afraid of Slinks or Potcrabs...and my supply of [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA76]s is nearly used up. Would you be willing to fetch some for me?</p>

          <p>That's decent of you! Thanks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need five or more [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA76]s to finish ornamenting the current batch of weapons. You should be able to find Crystals in the river, or the pools in front of the citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, by the way, there's some sort of brigand camp out there. Be careful of them. We don't know who they are, but they've been attacking travelers.</p>

          <p>What beautiful specimens! These are genuine [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA76]s, grown underwater over centuries.</p>
