          <p>I do not give praise lightly, [%username], but your development has been most pleasing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the right nurturing, you may one day grow into a fine Alchemist. You see, students are much like blocks of lead, dull and witless, and it is only with a master's knowledge that they may be transmuted into gold. Remember, what will shine tomorrow, must be polished today...and that means work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I have a small errand for you.</p>

          <p>It's simple really, I'm sure you'll have no trouble.</p>

          <p>Lucius has been pestering me to send him more Pioneer's Spellbooks. I've put him off for as long as I can but he is most insistent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would like you to make the delivery. I'm quite sure you can spare the time.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Many young Daevas forget their obligations all too easily. It is fortunate that you show more dedication.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this package to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lucius]. It contains the spellbooks he has been waiting for. Pristine editions, I might add.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should hurry. He'll be anxious to get his hands on them!</p>

          <p>That's just so irresponsible, so uncharitable, so...typical!</p>

          <p>Unless it's adorned with Kinah, a job isn't worth doing! That's what you think, isn't it?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can see this is pointless. Why don't you go and find a mission more suited to you, like counting your money. I'm sure it won't take long.</p>
