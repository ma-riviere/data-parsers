          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. It seems I have a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been administering the new High-level Flight Skill Test, and almost no Daevas are passing it. I thought most would pass on their first or second try, but...I think I made the test too hard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's too late to change the flight path, but I need to do something to make the test easier. It should be an appropriate challenge, but not impossible.</p>

          <p>I happen to know that you can increase your flight speed with a special mixture of alchemical materials and dried Fangwing Wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, Fangwings are easily found around the temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you bring me some? You can always use the opportunity to practice your flying, too.</p>

          <p>Ah, very nice. Each type of wing is supposed to produce a different sort of effect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to give the students too much of an advantage, after all, so I'll do a few sample batches and see which one offers the right amount of enhancement.</p>
