          <p>Is it true you've participated in infiltrations of dredgions in Reshanta?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If so, then you know that killing key crew members is a sound strategy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Leadership makes a battleship hum, after all. Without it, the crew falls into disarray.</p>

          <p>That's why I want to give that a shot here. At the very least, it'll disrupt the Chantra Dredgion's mission long enough to do something more...permanent to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obviously, this is a harder path than just running in and burning the supply rooms. But it's potentially more rewarding, since a good crew is much harder to replace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to give you first crack at this mission. Interested?</p>

          <p>Now, for this to be effective, you need to kill every commanding and secondary officer aboard. Take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724b]s as proof.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our intelligence also says that two outside officers, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanRaInspector_55_Ah] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanFiSupply_55_Ae], are visiting the Chantra Dredgion. Take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724c] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3724d].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, those last two items contain vital intelligence that could help us out a great deal. Make sure to take it all to Brigade General Valetta.</p>

          <p>Pity. But I knew this would be a difficult mission to recruit for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Going up against a Dredgion is a dicey proposition under any circumstances. But to deliberately go after its strongest crew...that's another thing entirely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry, you're not the only Daeva in Atreia. I'll find someone else who'll be able to take this on.</p>

          <p>Yorgen has reported that you're making our crew assassination strategy into Balic reality aboard the Chantra Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anything that undercuts its efficiency is desirable, and the crew is certainly a key factor in it.</p>

          <p>I can only imagine the disarray aboard the Chantra Dredgion right now. With any luck, it'll take quite a while for the Balaur to regroup and obtain another crew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the meantime, we will examine the reports you obtained for any intelligence about their movements and logistics.</p>

          <p>Your reputation is well-deserved. Your actions speak louder than any idle boasts you could make.</p>
