          <p>I know the tests you've taken so far were difficult, but this one is even more formidable. An order of magnitude more formidable, I'd wager.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This time we test both luck and persistence. Being lucky is often better than being good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But every Miragent's Holy Templar knows this truth: If you're persistent, eventually you'll be lucky as well.</p>

          <p>That's exactly what I'm talking about, [%username]. Now let's put it into action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's said that when Atreia split into two, the Tower of Eternity shed tears even as it was breaking apart. Those brightly glittering tears must have dropped somewhere in Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whether that's folklore or history, it's certainly true that only the lucky can find those crystals, and thus we call them Tears of Luck. And your next test is to find them.</p>

          <p>A [%dic:STR_DIC_I_3939b] doesn't look like much. They're small, transparent, and glittering--like small flowers hidden in the bush.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystal is neither solid nor liquid--it's a coalescence of light. Touch it, and it fades away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why you need a special tool to gather a Tear of Luck. Extraction merchant [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sabotes] has such a tool, but beware...she charges a staggering price for it.</p>

          <p>My father and grandfather dedicated their lives to developing the extraction tool. That's the kind of hold that the quest for luck can put on your soul. Two generations of my family, devoted to this singular cause!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its parts are so sensitive that they must be recalibrated after every use. And the tool itself is made from the rarest, purest metals.</p>
