          <p>That Thersites! I hear he leaves a trail of weeping women in his wake. After a deed like this, I think I know why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But these gifts, this is far too much for a simple courting. I think he really has a thing for me....</p>

          <p>Oh no! Thersites said that? I wonder how many Daevas have heard that line before me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thersites isn't the first man to seek my heart with gifts. But he is the most recent. And possibly the one with the best taste.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>He's quite an old Daeva, isn't he? I know he tries to conceal it, but even my mother has heard stories about him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wouldn't be so bad if...wait, you're not going to repeat what I say, right? I suppose if he can trust you with the woman he loves, I can trust you as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between you and me, Thersites just isn't the one. He likes me too much, and that's not appealing. There is little challenge in easy prey, right? Let him down softly, though. Tell him I died in battle...quickly, painlessly.</p>

          <p>As for these beautiful gifts, I guess if you had found me dead, you'd have to return them to him.</p>

          <p>Tell you what. Tell Thersites that you gave me the gifts as I lay nearly lifeless on my deathbed. And then I died soon after. If he had been here instead of you, things might have turned out differently. Tell him this for me.</p>
