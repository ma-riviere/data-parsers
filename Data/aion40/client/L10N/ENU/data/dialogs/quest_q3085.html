          <p>You've piqued my interest. What you have there is not a map, it's a riddle. What's important is this poetry...did you really bring this map from Theobomos?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before the Cataclysm, a submarine volcano exploded in there. These words detail a crater of some sort, I'd guess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should ask the Shugos of the Meniherk Excavation Union for the exact location.</p>

          <p>Talos said that the treasure map looked different from all the fake maps you brought so far, and said that it must be showing the place where the treasure is hidden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the map contained not just an unknown area, but also a strange poem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you asked Walking Encyclopedia Fuchsia for her advice. It led you to Yadamonerk, who said that he couldn't tell you the location until you tell him what it is about.</p>
