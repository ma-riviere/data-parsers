          <p>[%username], if you're willing then, I have another mission for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You probably know this, but killing the Captain isn't enough to completely incapacitate the Dredgion. To do that, we must damage the Dredgion itself--not just its crew.</p>

        <p>My plan is to destroy certain key facilities aboard the Dredgion. Obviously, this will require infiltrating the Dredgion itself, which is quite perilous, as you already know.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Knowing all that, are you interested in perpetrating some sabotage?</p>

          <p>Excellent! As far as I can tell, we should destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_Surkana_1] in the Weapon Warehouse and the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_Surkana_4] in the Nuclear Control Room. Striking those two areas should cause the whole Dredgion to come to a standstill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That should create some delightful confusion!</p>

          <p>I suppose we have some time to think about this, and I can't force you to go. But I do want you to carry out this mission if you have a plan to infiltrate the Dredgion anyway.</p>

          <p>I don't think it'll be a big burden for you, [%username]. I've heard tales of your prowess.</p>

          <p>That surely put the Dredgion into disarray! I'll await reports from the rest of my men and see what we can learn from this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know this won't completely drive the Balaur away from Reshanta, but every step we take is one step closer to victory.</p>

          <p>You destroyed a Weapon Warehouse Maintaining Surkana and a Nuclear Control Surkana as he suggested.</p>
