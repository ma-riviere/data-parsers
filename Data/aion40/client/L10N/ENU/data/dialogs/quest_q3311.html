          <p>Of course, spirits can create wind, water, and fire, depending on their natures. In this case they're causing whirlwinds that can tear a Daeva right out of the sky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been a problem in the past, but only infrequently. Now it's happening all the time. I think something has made them angry.</p>

          <p>[%username], can you get rid of some of them?</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_0C_ElementalAir2_29_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_6C_elementalair3_31_Ae]s are the most troublesome ones.</p>

          <p>Daevas spend a lot of time getting ready for this flight test, and it's a shame to see them fail because of this interference.</p>

          <p>Well done!</p>

          <p>I'm sure you've saved the pride of many Daevas today. It's quite embarrassing to be knocked out of the air like that.</p>
