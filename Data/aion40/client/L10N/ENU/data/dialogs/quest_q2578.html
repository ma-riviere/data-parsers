          <p>Oh, I'm not sure. I had so many rings. Let me try it on.</p>

          <p>Hmmm...it won't go past my second knuckle. I guess it's too small to be mine. I always had my rings sized perfectly by a skilled jeweller. Here, take it back.</p>

          <p>Perhaps it belongs to Old [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rerua]? She has very slender fingers.</p>

          <p>A ring? When I was young I was very popular you know. Presents from the men of the village used to fill my whole room. I had dozens of rings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This ring is a little too big, though. I don't think it could be mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it does look familiar. I may have seen [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Midheim] wearing it once. Why don't you ask her? She's right there.</p>

          <p>Yesterday, Rotenan said to me "Mom, don't worry too much."</p>

          <p>I'm glad that he's taking all this so well. Better than me, I suppose. Children are very resilient, they say.</p>
