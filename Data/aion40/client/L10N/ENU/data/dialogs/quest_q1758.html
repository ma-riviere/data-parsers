          <p>Pontus said that Asmodians who lost the Sulfur Fortress were scouting from a base in the Krakon. At first he didn't do anything. But they became more active, so he wanted to teach them a lesson.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to the Krakon, got rid of Red Hasia Legionaries Sinjah, Glati, and Gagrad, and took the Mark of Red Hasia as the evidence. When Pontus saw the Mark, he was pleased. </p>
