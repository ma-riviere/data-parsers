          <p>That we came from the same seed seems...unimaginable to me. You...so beautiful, and us almost ready to knock at death's door.</p>

          <p>We saw our village turn to desert. As we fled, some slipped away, caught by the heat and blistering sun. We walked for days, then found a spring. As we knelt to drink at its banks, Lepharists attacked. What you see here is all that survived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, are we safe? No, death has simply donned another mask and come again. We're dying, [%username]. This time, thirst will be the end of us.</p>
