          <p>[%username], let's talk for a moment. It'll take my mind off... my wounds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're a mercenary, like me. We've spent most of our time here culling the local wildlife, and I've come to find the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF1_name] environs intriguing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This region is remote, so it's seen few battles. As a result, there are undisturbed ruins here. And the animals... they're wonderful! When they're not attacking us, that is. Nghh... damn that Worg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA12_1]? They're an amazing species unique to... ah... my... back....</p>

          <p>I'm getting better. My fever has gone. The wound still... burns, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'd like to study the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA12_1]. Rumor has it that they were simple plants, transformed by the Cataclysm... mutated!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help me study these creatures, [%username]? I'd like a few specimens. Or... rather, their hearts.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I knew you had a curious mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA12_1]s roam on the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA06]. I'd like to have a few hearts for my anatomy sketchbook.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A scientific curiosity to ponder... while I heal. To think--a plant with a heart!</p>

          <p>A shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I shouldn't expect mercenaries to share my enthusiasm for natural studies. Though I wasn't born a naturalist... my love for this world grew over time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You better get going, [%username]. But look more closely at the world around you, eh?</p>

          <p>Now I can study these and learn if they arose out of the Cataclysm... or natural evolution.... A perfect project to calm a fevered mind!</p>

          <p>Thank you, friend. Please... take this as a token. I'll mention you in my paper, too.</p>
