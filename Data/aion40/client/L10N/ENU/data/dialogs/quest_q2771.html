          <p>Red Hasia sent us to watch over this tower and scout out the fortress, but some days I hate this place.</p>

          <p>As if dealing with the Ellies and the Balaur out here in the Abyss weren't enough, even the dead plague us out here.</p>

          <p>You'd think so, but not in the Ruins of Roah. When great Atreian city of Roah was sucked into the Abyss, the residents were exposed to massive amounts of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Midori thinks those who survived the initial infusion interred their dead in those make-shift stone mausoleums, but the Aether here corrupted their souls, or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't know if it was the Aether or the risen spirits that did it, but all the remaining residents eventually died. Their souls never found eternal rest.</p>

          <p>Sad for them, but maddening for me. I've got a job to do out here and every [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_Maidengolem_30_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_ShadowStalker_30_An] slows down my work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Corrupted as they are, they forget they were ever once Atreians, and attack us. The Ghosts of Oblivion hassle ground scouts around the fortress and the Disturbed Residents pick off our flying scouts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Luckily, Pandaemonium understands and lets me pay anyone who assists us with silver coins.</p>

          <p>Destroying the Disturbed Residents and Ghosts of Oblivion in the Ruins of Roah should allow our scouts to do the job we were sent out here to do.</p>
