          <p>You're [%username], right? I know you're good at what you do. And I hope you can be discreet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at us: Everything seems under control here at Roah, right? Sure! So why are we taking casualties? I'm the laughingstock of the officer corps!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My men are sharp. No enemy has even reached these walls, not one. Yet every day, we find one or two sentries lying unconscious--if we find them at all.</p>

          <p>Exactly. I questioned one survivor, and she said she was attacked by a statue. Nothing else there, so she let her guard down--and boom! She's waking up hours later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We didn't realize those 'statues' were Ancient Garcikhans, and my pluma of a predecessor didn't bother warning me about them. I'd like you to drive off the Ancient Garcikhans and protect our sentries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make no mistake, I'd have my troops over those of any other fortress. We've crushed the Elyos and the Balaur many times. But I equip them for large-scale battles, not guerilla fighting against statue-monsters.</p>

          <p>There are many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_Gargoyle_30_An]s in the outer area of Roah Fortress. Be careful, they're more agile than you'd think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And bring some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2821a]s as proof you have disposed of them. Nothing like war trophies to put the troops at ease.</p>

          <p>If you're busy with other tasks, so be it. Let the other officers talk behind my back; we have special problems here in Roah.</p>

          <p>I could reorganize my men for skirmishes. They'd be effective against the Garcikhan...but vulnerable if the Elyos or Balaur come to call.</p>

          <p>Good work. I'll pass these around at the next briefing, and my troops will stop jumping at every shadow.</p>

          <p>More to the point, the other fortress commanders won't joke any more about my "non-battle casualties."</p>

          <p>Herat was concerned about ambush attacks on sentries guarding Roah Fortress's outer wall. Ancient Garcikhans are to blame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The soldiers in the fortress are equipped to fight soldiers, not stealthy predators, so Herat asked you to hunt the Garcikhans instead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you routed the Ancient Garcikhans and returned with their horns, she thanked you and said the news would improve morale at Roah Fortress.</p>
