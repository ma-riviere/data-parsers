          <p>How does one defend without weapons, I ask? Difficult, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We put in a request for a new supply of weapons weeks ago, yet we have nothing to show for it! The logistics officers at Teminon are dragging their feet. Presumably, they expect us to fight off the Asmodians with sticks and stones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's pitiful, I tell you. Out of desperation, we've begun crafting our own weapons.</p>

          <p>Well, that's the one ray of sunlight actually....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're looking at the Tricos. Their horns are incredibly strong and can be adapted into weapons with the right tools. All we need now is the horns themselves....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing to get us some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1820a]s? I would ask the other Daevas here, but they're standing guard at the moment with the few weapons we have left.</p>
