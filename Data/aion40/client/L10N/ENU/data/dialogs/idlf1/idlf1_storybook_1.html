          <p>--Experimental Record</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This book will record the procedures and results of live body experiments conducted in Poeta so that they might be referenced by future experimenters.</p>

          <p>1. Obtaining Resources</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before entering Poeta, we collected Drana seeds, Dragel, and Drazma from the base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For our plans to succeed, we'll need a stable source of Drana grown in Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now we'll send the harvest back for processing into Dragel, Drazma, and Surkana. In time we will set up facilities here in Poeta to produce Dragel and Drazma.</p>

          <p>2. The Seeding of Drana</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We sowed several test sites in Poeta with Drana seeds procured from the base. Germination and growth speed were closely monitored.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The seeds sown in the former strip mine sprouted fastest and showed the greatest degree of viability, so this became The Drana Fields.</p>

          <p>3. Remodeling with Dragel</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither Monitors nor Drakes exist in Poeta, so we needed to find a new creature that would be easily remodeled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even before we started the experiment, Kerubar were exceptionally hostile and resisted us ferociously. We decided to eliminate them from the area. Abex and Worg were likewise deemed unsuitable for the experiments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kobolds and Krall seemed too intelligent to be remodeled, but as they were they were relatively obedient, we decided to use them as test subjects.</p>

          <p>3-1. Results of Kobold Remodeling</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As there were no data available on remodeling a Kobold, we weren't sure how much Dragel to use. We formed several test groups and administered different amounts to each in successive doses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most successful method was to administer a dose equal to 1/50 the test subject's body weight every three days. This method has proven to cause the fewest deaths as well as the fewest side effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The remaining Dukakis were injected and one-third of them were successfully remodeled. The remainder either did not survive the initial testing, or were flawed, and subsequently destroyed.</p>

          <p>3-2. Results of Krall Remodeling</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Applying the test results from the Kobold study, we administered an amount equivalent to 1/50 the weight of each Krall at three-day intervals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Krall reacted poorly right away, exhibiting repetitive and self-harming behaviors, which led eventually to the death of all test subjects.</p>

          <p>4. Remodeling with Drazma</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because Poeta has a dense forest and a huge lake, we anticipated being able to produce Marabatas and Dragrints, for which a steady supply of Drazma would be needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Marabata remodeling has progressed to the final stage. They will be ready for action soon.</p>

          <p>4-1. Marabatas</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We chose Marabatas as candidates for Drazma remodeling, since Cliona Lake in Poeta seemed large enough to hold several.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As our goal was to produce Marabatas with different abilities, we used a Drazma engraved with different magic for each test subject.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are still working on refining these abilities.</p>

          <p>4-2. Dragrints</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As dead wood is easier to work with than live trees, we decided to use tree stumps from the logging area for our Dragrint experiments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A small percentage of the test tree stumps stopped growing in the middle stages of the experiment, due to some side effects of the treatment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strangely, they seem as viable and perform as well as the full-grown ones, though, and will be valuable in combat.</p>

          <p>--Conclusion</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The lifeform remodeling tests conducted in Poeta by our research team are revolutionary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most notable results are our success in remodeling Kobolds, which possess at least a low level of intelligence, and the successful germination of Drana in the former strip mine. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our failure to remodel Krall with Dragel continues to be a low point, but we have hopes we'll discover the proper method with more experimentation.</p>
