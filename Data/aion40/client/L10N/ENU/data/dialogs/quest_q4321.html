          <p>I wear a Mau skin hat each time I venture near their village, just to let those fuzz faces know that opposing Asmodae means death.</p>

          <p>Even still...the Mau are no pushovers, but I'm sure you know that, [%username].</p>

          <p>Hahaha, That's what I like to hear!</p>
          <p> </p>	
          <p>You know, killing Mau in the Ice Claw Village might be tough, but the MuMu Village is a different story.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau stationed there are far weaker than those at Ice Claw Village. Even though the Mau at Ice Claw Village are the main threat, we can cut off their ginseng supply from the plantation by killing Mau at the MuMu Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we hit ginseng production at the plantation, we deal a crippling blow to Ice Claw Village. What do you say, [%username]? Interested in cracking some skulls?</p>

          <p>Let's start by killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanHunterM_29_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KeA_LycanKnightM_29_An], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanFighterM_29_An] in the MuMu Village. Ginseng production will drop, and the Ice Claw Mau will lose their power.</p>

          <p>I envy the soldiers who are sent to the front.... Though the Mau are formidable foes, it is fighting the Elyos that brings Asmodae true glory. Guard duty brings no such glory, but I suppose it has to be done.</p>

          <p>You slew a great number of Ice Claw Hunters, Ice Claw Guards, and Ice Claw Pawsoldiers at the plantation, and Hakon was most impressed.</p>
