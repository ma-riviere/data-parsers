          <p>As you may be aware, we've been trying to weaken their force through a series of small raids. It won't be enough. Our spies have caught word that the Ellies are going to send in an elite garrison to Kysis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're terribly under-manned until reinforcements arrive, but if we don't hit that elite garrison soon, their defenses will keep getting stronger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said, we need outside help. Will you join us?</p>
