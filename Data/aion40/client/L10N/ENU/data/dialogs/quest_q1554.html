          <p>A talking mirror gave you light to make a magic mirror, and that will get around the ward on the palace entrance? Well, that's an interesting theory. But will it work, that's the question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If...ah, I mean when you return, you'll have to let me know if it worked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and where'd you say that talking mirror was again? Just so I can know in case someone else asks....</p>

          <p>Oh, not to worry, [%username]. No one else will ever know, I swear. Now that you've satisfied my curiosity, it's time for me to help you. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rift you're looking for is nearby, fortunately. It should come out very near [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_E5].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a little to the left from the road down there, before you cross the bridge leading to Klawtan's Wallow.</p>

          <p>You're welcome. Oh, but that's not all! If you enter that rift, you'll arrive somewhere in northeast Beluslan. The rift isn't entirely stable, so I can't say exactly where you'll end up. Regardless, if you go east, you should be able to find Alukina's Palace.</p>

          <p>I'm glad to hear it. Be careful, I've heard the place is crawling with Seirens. Pretty to look at, but not exactly friendly. I'd be careful if I were you and bring friends just in case. </p>
