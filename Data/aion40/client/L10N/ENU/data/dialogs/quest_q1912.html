          <p>He used to have no trouble in wolfing down whole buckets of food in seconds, but lately he just hasn't touched his meals--he just pushes them around with his foot. Do you think he's ill?</p>

          <p>Me neither. Maybe he's become depressed after being locked up for so long? I'm the only one he has to talk to...all the others tease him or throw things at him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need something that'll raise his spirits again, maybe something from Verteron...hmm. Oh, I know! Krall Rations!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help me, [%username]? Head to Verteron and obtain some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_l_s_16d]s--they're Ulaguru's favorite! I'd go myself, but I can't risk leaving Ulaguru on his own for so long.</p>

          <p>Thank you! I was hoping I would be able to turn to you if something happened to poor Ulaguru.</p>

          <p>Hurry to Verteron and obtain the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_l_s_16d]s from Krall in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA22]. They're hostile and highly trained, but I'm sure you'll be fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not asking for many, just three rations. If they cheer Ulaguru up, then maybe I'll ask you to go again. If the rations do nothing, then we won't have wasted too much time.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, all my research will be in vain if I cannot complete my work. And I'll be honest: Ulaguru is more than a mere test subject to me. Ulaguru has become a friend, and I cannot stand by and watch him like this.</p>

          <p>Ulaguru has been getting weaker by the hour. I was just about to head to Luelas and ask him whether he could stomach making some Krall food for me.</p>

          <p>Ulaguru cannot go on like this much longer. If you want to actually help me, then you'll have to get back out there, infiltrate the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA22] in Verteron, and fetch the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_l_s_16d]s you promised me.</p>

          <p>Here you are Ula...wow! Look at him go! We should probably step back a little, [%username].</p>

          <p>Those rations disappeared pretty quickly, wouldn't you say? If you happen to find any more on your travels, bring them to me. They certainly did the trick and cheered Ulaguru up!</p>
