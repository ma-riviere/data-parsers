          <p>The reports from Medea in Asmodae indicate Ancient Elyos Spirits are wandering about near the Fortress of Sorrow in Morheim.</p>

          <p>The Asmodian Daevas constantly harass them and they have not returned to the flow of Aether.</p>

          <p>I can only guess they are the remnants of a Legion who was massacred in Asmodae long ago. No Guardian living or dead should be harassed by the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing can be done to bring them back to Elysea. I need someone to go to them and convince them to go back to the flow of Aether.</p>

          <p>Can you do this, [%username]? Will you go to Asmodae and talk to them?</p>

          <p>Medea's report says someone named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Undeaddark_qDNamedQ_28_An] seems to be leading the Spirits at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_B1_3] in Morheim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Persuade them to return to the flow of Aether; they have already completed their duty for Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before you go through the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_directportal] in the Ruberein Wastes, register at the Obelisk here. There won't be any obelisk in Asmodae that you can use.</p>

          <p>But the Elyos Spirits would never attack you, so that's a small comfort.</p>

          <p>We have completed our mission?</p>

          <p>Up until now, we have stood fast as Elyos, sure  we must continue with our mission. Even beyond death we continued.... But...but to hear Elysea considers our initial mission well done, relieves us greatly.</p>
