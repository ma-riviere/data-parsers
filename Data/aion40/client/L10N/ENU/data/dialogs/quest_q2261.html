          <p>After [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sueron] became Brigade General, he ordered all Archon sentinels to report in every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of the Archons gripe about the extra work, but I think most realize that it is helpful to have a better grasp of the situation in Altgard.</p>

          <p>The problem is that some Archons don't send their reports in on time. Probably because they aren't familiar with the new system.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dellalont's report from the Eastern Gateway hasn't arrived yet, for example. His site is vital to the security of the fortress. If it is delayed, General Suthran will get angry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you please drop by the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_16] and tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dellalont] to send his report?</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are some Archons who are having a hard time adapting to the general's ways, but I think this change is for the safety of us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dellalont] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_16]. Please make sure he sends his report promptly.</p>

        	<p>Many Archons complain about Brigade General Suthran's directives, but they won't mention it directly to him. Instead they blame me, saying I'm his toady.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most important mission for Archons, though, is to maintain the peace in this area and guard the Abyss Gate.</p>

          <p>You learned that once Brigade General Suthran arrived, protocol within the fortress was changed. Every Archon must now send in a weekly report.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meiyer informed you that Dellalont, who guards the Altgard East Gate, was late to send in his report.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At Meiyer's request, you met Dellalont and told him to submit his report.</p>
