          <p>[%username]! I need you. I'm going crazy handling the locals' wildlife, and now the Viragos...they've hijacked a wagon-load of Tripeeds!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nobody was seriously hurt, but they took the whole delivery for the Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What scares me is that I don't see why. They can't eat them, they're poisonous.</p>

          <p>Anyway, we can't let this go. This was a small load, not a big loss. But if this is just the start?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need this stopped. But as you know, my Archons are all on animal control. And I don't expect Human Watch members to handle Viragos.</p>
