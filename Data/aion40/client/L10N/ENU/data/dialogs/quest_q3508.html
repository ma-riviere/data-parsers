          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I'm glad to see you're still here. I thought that perhaps you already left for the sand saunas of the Eracus Desert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received another letter from Miobera, you know. Seems she's having trouble with the Ethereal Windwisps again.</p>

          <p>Well, they're back. Considering how many Ethereal Windwisps we destroyed last time, they must reproduce at an alarming rate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, their attacks are more ferocious than ever! Miobera doesn't dare take passage to the Puitonen BogsÂ now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to give her some support...but I'm stuck here at the village, as you can see. Can you lend a hand? She could always use a good [%userclass] over there.</p>

          <p>Get over there as soon as you can and start killing those shadow-cursed [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Vapor_41_An]s. You need to clear a safe path between the campsite entrance and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_F2].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send a message to Miobera and let her know you're on the way. The speed of Ariel to you, friend.</p>

          <p>Did you even manage to kill a single Ethereal Windwisp? You're as unreliable as those mead-swiggers in Agairon! Get out of my sight, Daeva!</p>

          <p>I'll bet a day's wage that you just returned from the Puitonen Bogs. Am I right? Am I right? The mud on your boots gave it away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ha! The gift of observation is a powerful tool...the most powerful tool a warrior has, though most seldom use it.</p>
