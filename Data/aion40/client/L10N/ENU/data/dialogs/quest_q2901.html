          <p>Most people ascend to become Daevas after they receive a powerful shock to the system. It's like striking flints together and making a spark. That friction--that clash--gives you power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What brought about your ascension, [%username]?</p>

          <p>No wonder people have been muttering about you. Word to the wise--keep your mouth shut about Munin. </p>

          <p>A lot of Daevas resent or ridicule Munin, you see. Prophecies about the Thirteenth Empyrean Lord? Honestly...</p>

          <p>I'm not about to discuss heresies like the Thirteenth Empyrean Lord with you. Like I said, Munin's name stinks here. People have long memories.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So forget about that old fool and figure out how you're going to prove your worth as a Daeva. We don't think much of fancy talk or empty boasts around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That reminds me--I've got your first posting. Congratulations! You are hereby ordered to make haste to Altgard Fortress.</p>

          <p>Altgard is rough. It's mostly ice and forest...and things with claws and teeth. Someone doesn't want you to have an easy ride, I'll bet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can take a tough first posting as a compliment--our superiors think you're capable. Or you could see it as a warning--a warning about consorting with the likes of Munin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Either way, you know what's expected of you. You'll pack up and head to Altgard right away, I expect?</p>

          <p>Take this letter of recommendation and haul over to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_1] on the double. When you arrive, give the letter to Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Meibjar], and he'll show you around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Getting to Altgard Fortress is easy.  Just ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Doman] in the Gate of Pandaemonium. He'll fire up his teleporter and send you off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One other thing...try to stay out of Brigade General Suthran's way. He doesn't exactly nurture new Daevas, if you know what I mean.</p>

          <p>Heimdall's already written to me about you. Looks like he thought you could use a guiding hand. "Go easy on [%username]," it says here. "Relatively inexperienced. Recent ascension."</p>
