          <p>The reason the Ruins of Roah are so important is the artifacts there. If we get those, we could turn the battle in our favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Hasia Legion came here to aid the Thunder Shout Legion. We're currently scouting out the Roah Fortress.</p>

          <p>It's not as fun as slaughtering those sun-skins en masse, but it's harder than we thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The main problem is, the fortress is quite heavily guarded. And we can't devote the manpower to killing them yet, because we haven't finished scouting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't finish scouting easily unless the guards are dead. It's a dilemma, all right. The solution could be, though, that you could just get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2809_all] yourself.</p>

          <p>Good. Now, the garrison will only be there when the Elyos have the fortress.</p>
