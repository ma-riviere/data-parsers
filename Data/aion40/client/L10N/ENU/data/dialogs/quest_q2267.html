          <p>Some time ago, I received a message asking us to guard a wagon that would be passing through with dangerous cargo. As if we weren't busy enough guarding the Observatory! But, it was an order, so....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the wagon came through, it didn't seem to be carrying anything dangerous. Just a stack of boxes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, Neifenmer and I escorted the wagon up to the lower area of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_27], just like the order said.</p>

          <p>After escorting the wagon up to where the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_15] could be seen, we returned to our post at the Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On our way back, we heard a commotion. When we turned back, the wagon was burning and the boxes were rolling down the hill toward the Airship Dock.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was no way to find out what exactly happened! The people pulling the wagon just seemed to disappear.</p>

          <p>Some sort of monster came out of one of the boxes! What were they thinking, carting monsters around like everyday cargo?</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Neifenmer and I did our best to hunt them down, but there were too many. I think we missed a few.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are still boxes drifting near the Airship Dock. It's too dangerous to leave them be. Would you please deal with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MimicD_17_n]es?</p>

          <p>If you head down from [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_27] toward the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_15], you should see the burning wagon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go down a little further from there, and you'll see the road to the dock on the right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MimicD_17_n]es on the dock and around the nearby islands. Please deal with those boxes!</p>
