          <p>I need to send a letter to my second oldest brother, and was hoping to ask someone who is going to Pandaemonium to have it delivered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Freyr]. He's a Preceptor of Clerics and Chanters at the Capitol Building. I know it's a bothersome task, but my brother wouldn't let you go without giving you a reward. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can teleport to Pandaemonium from the fortress in moments.</p>

          <p>Yes. People tend to listen when I tell them who my brother is. Most people know of my family.</p>

          <p>I don't care. I don't live off of my family's name.</p>
