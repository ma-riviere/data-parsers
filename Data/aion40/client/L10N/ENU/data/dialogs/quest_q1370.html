          <p>We should not have come to this...difficult decision, Daeva. But I see no other way out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even though he wasn't a Daeva, Isson was a natural leader among the people of the village. People looked up to him, and I...I loved him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the big dry threatened our little brook--our only supply of drinking water--he suggested that we dig a well. </p>

          <p>Isson and some villagers dug a well, but found no water. When they dug deeper, the walls collapsed, and the villagers were buried alive. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Isson blamed himself, and begged for forgiveness, but the survivors attacked Isson and injured him badly. I coaxed them into letting me lock him in a warehouse. It was for his protection! But Isson felt that I'd betrayed him--and our love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He broke out of the warehouse and disappeared into the desert. I thought he was lost forever.</p>

          <p>Many years have passed and most have forgotten Isson. But he has not forgotten us. He's returned, and now he's a Lepharist boss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Isson has occupied the Mystic Spring of Agairon, keeping us from its healing waters. Then he poisoned the brook and people fell ill.... I'm afraid of what revenge he will wreak upon us--or me--next.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He'll not listen to me, who betrayed his love. Daeva [%username], will you save us? Will you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparAsNamed_34_An] before he commits another crime?</p>

          <p>The Lepharist Revolutionaries are camping near the Agairon Mystic Spring. Isson will be with them. He is the Scout Leader and always has his men with him, so it won't be easy to get to him. Be careful.</p>
