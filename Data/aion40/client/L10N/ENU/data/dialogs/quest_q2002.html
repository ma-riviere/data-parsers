          <p>Thank Zikel you're here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've got a serious problem...it's [%dic:STR_DIC_LA493], the boss's kid. She's missing, and we need to find her before Ulgorn does something rash.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yesterday she said she was going for a walk in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA183], and no one's seen her since. Nobody noticed until she didn't show up for breakfast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I checked her room, I found a note on her bed. Said she wants to be a real raider, not just the boss's little girl.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I showed the note to Ulgorn, and he turned positively pale.</p>

          <p>Ah, Rae's always putting herself in harm's way and pestering us to take her along on raids. If we refuse, she tags along anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the boss don't want this life for her. Ulgorn wants her to stay in camp, study her books, and make a better life for herself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she's got raider blood, you know? You can see her father's glint in her eyes. Makes me kinda nervous.</p>

          <p>The boss's daughter, Rae, is missing. You went to Dabi first, who said that she might have gone to the old witch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The witch said she would help you if you would do her a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>You touched a mushroom while doing a favor for the witch and were transformed into a Ribbit, but quickly regained Human form.</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>The witch revealed that she'd also turned Rae into a Ribbit, but you found Rae and broke the spell.</p>
