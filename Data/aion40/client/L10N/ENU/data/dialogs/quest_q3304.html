          <p>Did you come about the job?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Telemachus has said he can't tolerate the Lepharist activities any longer and has ordered a full-scale operation against them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem though, is simple numbers. Too many Legions have been posted in the Abyss, and we've had had to turn to individual Daevas.</p>

          <p>Of course. Rewards vary depending on the difficulties of missions. The mission I'm now offering is to gather 80 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_LEHPAR_QUEST_01A]s. The reward is a ring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only qualifications are courage and persistence, and you have ample measures of both. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Yes, this is exactly 80! Now that you've kept your promise, [%username], I should do too. Here's your reward for the mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each ring has a different function. Choose one you like, because you can't exchange it.</p>

          <p>There are other missions offering a necklace and earrings. Tell me if you're interested. They will match this ring and boost its magic power.</p>
