          <p>You know that Roah used to be a city in Heiron, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's where I'm from originally, so you can imagine how heartbreaking it is for me to see the former residents forced to wander the Abyss so long after their deaths. Just think--some of them could be my ancestors!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really wish I could do something to end their suffering.</p>

          <p>I've been doing some research, and it seems that each of them is animated by a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1821a]. The high concentration of Aether here in the Abyss tends to build up and crystallize inside undead creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The solution is simple yet dangerous: defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1211_Maidengolem_30_An]s and remove their crystals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard that you have some experience in dealing with them, [%username]. Do you think you can handle this?</p>
