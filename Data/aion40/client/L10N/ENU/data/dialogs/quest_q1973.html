          <p>Indeed. So, buy the design for Fasimedes' Noble Greatsword from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nakia]. Then, craft one. This will require far more skill than was required to create [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1973].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not easy to craft, so if you manage it, you'll prove your talent to me and garner my approval.</p>
