          <p>One of my signature items, Siel's Tears Earrings, requires very delicate crafting techniques. A transparent crystal must be shaped then polished until the reflection it gives is absolutely clear. There can be no flaws in the finish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystal I use is dazzling when treated correctly. Despite what most people seem to think, the stone itself is actually rather common. It's my time and meticulous craftsmanship that inflates the earrings' price.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find Altgard crystals everywhere in Altgard, if you care to look. The problem is, most people don't.</p>

          <p>Altgard crystals are the only stones I use for these earrings. Naturally, the hooks and filigree require a little gold, but the item's elegance lies in its simplicity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The simpler the item, the more you can see the mark of its creator. When I make these earrings, I let my mind relax. I let my hands become waves, lapping at the crystal as I polish it, so eventually it is perfectly smooth, as smooth as water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This requires a suitable abrasive. Luxury items can't be crafted with cheap tools.</p>

          <p>Not until recently. I've developed a method that combines processed crustacean shells with finely ground Spirit Crystal. The results are remarkable!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because of the war in the Abyss, there hasn't been much demand for luxury goods. Most of my time has been put to use crafting devotional items or supplies for the Abyss. I've completely run out of this abrasive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You seem a determined sort. Would you be able to find the materials for me? If I break a finger trying to gather those things, I'll get no work done at all!</p>

          <p>Excellent!  I'll need a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2924a]--obviously the Klaw aren't going to just hand them over--plus some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2924b]. The essence I got from the Blackwater Spirits was among the best I've ever used.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystal shouldn't take too long to fashion if you can bring me these items.</p>

          <p>What?! I can't polish the Altgard Crystal without the right abrasive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be folly to use a lesser quality substance. Maybe someone who cares about quality will come by and help me out....</p>

          <p>I'll still need those things, though. Remember--a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2924a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2924b]. That's all I need.</p>

          <p>Ah! Excellent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After I grind the Klaw shell and Spirit Essence, I'll have all the abrasive I need. The skill of the Handicrafter is not only their dexterity, but selecting the right tools and materials!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These earrings will be finished soon. Thank you for your help. You're a Daeva of your word!</p>
