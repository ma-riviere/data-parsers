          <p>Pardon me, I was hoping to ask you a question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen my master? He's an armorcrafter named Starket. He said he was going to be out for a bit, but he hasn't returned since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a superbly talented man so I doubt he's in trouble. Still, we'll have to launch a rescue if he's not back soon. What if the Balaur have taken him?</p>
