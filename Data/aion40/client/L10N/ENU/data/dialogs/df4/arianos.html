          <P>Now and then, certain Daevas bring "interesting" items and store them in their warehouse.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Now, I don't discriminate. I mean, it's not as if the items are mine...but each time I receive one of "those" items, I make a note on who deposited it.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>These notes could be worth a lot to the right person.... What? Blackmail? No, that's not it at all!</P>
