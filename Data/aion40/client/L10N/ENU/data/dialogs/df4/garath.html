          <p>Equipping and removing Stigma Stones carries a great cost. Few realize the immense physical and mental energy it takes to add or remove the memories of the past.... Not to mention years of research....</p>

          <p>No, don't go away, [%username]. I never said I wouldn't help you. I just ask that you take a moment to appreciate the hard work I am about to do for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is why you are here, yes?</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, [%username], but you are not yet capable of using Stigma. You must first learn to communicate properly with a Stigma Stone, and that I cannot teach you.</p>
