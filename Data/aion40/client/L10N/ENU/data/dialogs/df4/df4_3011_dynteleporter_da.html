          <p>I am charged with protecting the bind point to the Vorgaltem Citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I communicate with Leopolt, and help our Daevas enter Vorgaltem Citadel when it is under attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Protecting the bind point can be such a drag though. I'm envious of the Daevas who join the battles while I watch them from afar.</p>
