          <p>How does one track Dramata, the student inquires. To hunt a beast one must become a beast...to become a beast one must devour beasts...to devour a beast one must have a spoon....</p>

          <p>Yes...a spoon! No other utensil will do. Dramata dislike the spoon...the spoon is frightening...but the eggs are not afraid of the spoon.</p>
