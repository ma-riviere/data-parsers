          <p>Balaurea is such a fascinating place, don't you agree? I'm not saying it's pleasant, but even nasty things can be interesting. There are so many things to see here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As fas as I'm concerned, everything is worth studying--even our enemies. To know something is to understand it, and to understand it is to know how to deal with it...or destroy it.</p>

          <p>Well, as far as we can tell, they're naturally occurring phenomena unique to Balaurea. See, the atmosphere here is much more volatile, and the constantly changing air pressure has formed these constant passages--windstreams--to help equalize the turbulent skies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can and should take advantage of them, [%username]. They can take you to far away places in the blink of an eye!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sorolov] knows more than any of us. She's written detailed reports on the windstreams at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C4] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_A4]. She's a bit...odd in speech, but she has the most experience.</p>
