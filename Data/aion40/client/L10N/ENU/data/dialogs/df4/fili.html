          <p>You can find your way around by yourself. Far more important is knowing something about the people here.</p>

          <p>The three most powerful are Marchutan's Agent Richelle, Brigade General Valetta of the Fatebound, and Chairman Vellun from the 1st Pandaemonium Research Center. Wanna know more about them?</p>

          <p>Richelle is one of Lord Marchutan's personal agents, so you probably heard a lot about her already. But she's actually really nice--one of the most approachable Empyrean agents there is!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She may look small, but her real power is in magic. I hear she can take down an entire Elyos legion with one spell!</p>

          <p>Wow, I thought everyone knew about Brigade General Valetta! Rumor has it that she was walking and talking as soon as she was born! I don't believe it, of course. But she's as smart as she is strong. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear that there was a real struggle between the scholars and generals to get her on their team. Of course she chose the army, and we all know how well that turned out!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't tell anyone I told you this, but it seems that Centurion Brynhild is really jealous of her. She criticizes every decision Valetta makes, behind closed doors, of course. They went to school together, and I think the Centurion's still jealous!</p>

          <p>Oh, well, I can't tell you much about the 1st Pandaemonium Research Center. I was just assigned to them recently, and I'm still feeling them out.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Chairman Vellun is definitely the smartest in that organization of smarties. I hear he invented most of their best-known devices all by himself!</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Still, I've seen him talk to himself when he thinks no one's looking. And I hear he hates Ribbits, but I can't confirm that.</P>
