          <p>You can't imagine how exciting it is to work in the research center. There is so much to learn, so many things to experiment with....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was going to finish researching plants that emit Aether and move on to Aetheric ores, but there are so many different kinds of Aether-containing plants that it will take years to catalogue them all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't want to just give up on plant Aethers to switch to ores, but what if the ores are more interesting? If it was you, which one would you study?</p>
