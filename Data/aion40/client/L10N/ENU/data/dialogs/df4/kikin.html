          <p>Greetings, good [%userclass]. You doubtless already know about the Marchutan Priory. But did you know of the Empyrean Crucible?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Located within Priory headquarters, the Crucible presents a series of challenges designed to prepare our Daevas for battles to come.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may also gain rewards for good performance. If you're interested, please see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Virvain].</p>
