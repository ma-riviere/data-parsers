          <p>Gelkmaros is a fascinating region. Everything is so old--I feel like I'm getting a glimpse of Atreia before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I was studying to be a scholar. When I ascended, I decided I'd serve Asmodae better as a soldier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know other Daevas stay in academia, but I like my role. I probably wouldn't have seen any of this as a scholar!</p>
