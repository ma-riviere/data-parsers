          <p>The Reians are a fascinating people. Talking with them is like talking directly to Atreia's past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eddas in particular.... I could question him for hours on all sorts of subjects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians are not my primary concern here, but I always find time to speak with Eddas. He could be the key to victory over the Elyos.</p>
