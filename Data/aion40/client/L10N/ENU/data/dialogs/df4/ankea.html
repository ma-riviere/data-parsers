          <p>Bah! I feel like I'm standing here doing nothing while I could be spilling blood. </p>

          <p>I know it's important to hold strategic positions, but the Balaur could at least attack us once in a while so I don't die from boredom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Balaur were attacking more often, I bet Arango would keep his eyes on the perimeter...AND OFF MY BACKSIDE. I hope he heard that.</p>
