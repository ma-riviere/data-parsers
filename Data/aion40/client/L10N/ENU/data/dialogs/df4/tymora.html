          <p>Azphelumbra. I am Tymora, chief instructor at the Marchutan Priory. Most know of our efforts to aid younger Daevas, but we do more than that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And we have just opened our headquarters, and the facilities within, for a wider audience.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have made great strides in training even veteran Daevas for the dark times that Lord Marchutan foresees.</p>

          <p>He saw our forces in a great battle at Vorgaltem...and our terrible loss there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a sign. We are not prepared to face Tiamat's forces. That battle may be fated, but ones after are not necessarily so!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is why we must prepare. That is why we must train. That is why we must win.</p>
