          <p>Daeva! Would you like to try a new concoction I whipped up? It's a mixture of Balaur blood and the Breath of Brohum. It'll make you tougher! I can't guarantee that, of course, but still....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should also mention that when the effect wears off you'll be paralyzed for a month.... So there's that to consider. Hmmmm.....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you'd rather try something safer? Everything else I sell is free of side-effects. I think.</p>
