          <p>I don't know why the Daevas here ostracize me. Pretentious and prideful, scorning a "mere" scholar? Half of them ignore me, and the rest don't even care to learn my name!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one among them, though, who I have heard is different. A [%userclass] who has risen through the ranks not through arrogance and ignorance, but by respecting others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This great Daeva's name is [%username]. If you happen to see this [%userclass], please mention that I wish to speak to them in person.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now go, leave me, whoever you are. I have no time for one such as you.</p>
