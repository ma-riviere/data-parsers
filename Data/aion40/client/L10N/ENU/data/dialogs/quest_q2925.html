          <p>[%username]! I've just received Sadena's gift! Seems I owe you two favors. If I'd known you'd have to obtain the materials as well as make the order, I'd never have asked you. Well, maybe I would have...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was worried about spending so much Kinah on one gift, but now...now I have to actually tell her how I feel...the money seems like nothing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is awful. What if I stutt startering...I mean start stuttering. There! See? It's happening already!</p>

          <p>Yes. No. You don't understand. I'm not just giving her a gift. I need to confess my feelings to her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I know Sadena--everything has to be perfect! The right place, the right time, the right mood, even the right clothing!</p>

          <p>That's the problem, [%username]! I don't know what I should wear. It's no use me pouring my heart out if she thinks I dress like a slob.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to do me one last favor. After this, I promise, I'll never ask for your help again. What I'd like you to do is very simple. Buy one of Eiren's latest outfits and show Sadena. See what she thinks of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she has a favorable impression of it, I'll wear one like it when I go to speak to her. Will you help me once more?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>She is very picky about clothes. In fact, the only clothes she seems to like are those made by Eiren. I've seen [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lark] with them in the Prosperity Road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is extremely important! If she gives any indication that she doesn't like it--and it's not normally hard to tell--I'll have to find another outfit.</p>

          <p>Look at what you're wearing now. The color is all wrong. And the cut? No, no, no... it makes you look short. Not flattering at all. You can't buy class. You either have taste or you don't. And you....</p>

          <p>The Daevas of the Vanahal District are famously fussy, but Sadena is too much! I can't work with her! She asked for garlands of white flowers, so I found some. Beautiful woven strings of unblemished petals.</p>

          <p>But Sadena changed her mind. They didn't suit the furnishings, she said. Red flowers would be better, she said. And when I got red flowers, she wanted running water! Ugh!</p>
