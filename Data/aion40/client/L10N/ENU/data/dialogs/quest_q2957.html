          <p>Karollin's banquet is really taking shape thanks to you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nearly all of the preparations are done. I've entrusted Dorein with the rest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's a bit scatty but she's worked in the banquet hall for a long time so she ought to do a good job.</p>

          <p>Oh, dear. Do I sound less-than-confident? Well it's just that this is her first time charge of the banquet arrangements. She knows what has to be done but she's never had this much responsibility before. I'm a little worried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you do me a favour and go and check up on her for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd do it myself, but I don't want her to think I don't trust her.</p>

          <p>Thanks. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dorein] will be glad to see you, [%username]. She already knows who you are.</p>

          <p>I am SO glad you stopped by. You helped arrange some of this banquet for Karollin, and,er...I think I might have a teensy weensy, uh...flower problem.</p>

          <p>I told [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_10] to get these special flowers from a lake in Ishalgen and he promised he would. He said he was on top of it but there's still no flowers and I haven't seen him since last night!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you go to the Airship Dock and give him a nudge? I'm sure it'd be more...motivating, if you did it. I really need those flowers. Like, yesterday.</p>

          <p>Selesti entrusted Dorein, a banquet hall worker, with the banquet preparation. She asked you to check on Dorein to see if she needed help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dorein complained that the flowers were late, so you paid a visit to the supplier, a Shugo named Kamorunerk. He promised to speed up the delivery. When you told Dorein the flowers would arrive soon, she was relieved.</p>
