          <p>Now these...these are some prize Porguses. Look at the gloss on their fur--that's a sure sign of health. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My plan is to give a Porgus to each new settler who takes a chance on life here in Brusthonin. Just a little something to get them started, you see. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that means a lot of careful breeding ahead. I don't have nearly enough stock right now.</p>

          <p>Good point--more settlers than Porguses will be a nice problem to have. There is a problem now, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These Porguses are so energetic that they keep escaping their cages and walking around the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ervin and Baltasar have been complaining a lot about Runaway Porguses grunting and digging up the ground. [%username], can you help me round up the animals?</p>

          <p>You'll find escaped Porguses wandering around the village. If you can get even two of them back here, it'll show Ervin that I'm taking his complaints seriously. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may need to give them a smack or two in the rump to get them back into the cages. But don't use a weapon--they're just Porguses, after all. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, avoid Reaper Squaddies. Some of my Porguses dug under a fence and ate some of their rations, so the troops are looking for payback.</p>

          <p>You know what? Maybe I should just let Ervin complain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, a Porgus is a peaceful animal, and they never leave the village. What's the harm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe all that wandering around is the exercise they need to stay healthy here in Brusthonin.</p>
