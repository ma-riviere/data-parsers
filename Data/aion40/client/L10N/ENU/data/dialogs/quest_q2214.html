          <p>This is my last quill, and I only use [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2214a]s to make them. They really are the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to help, could you bring me the materials to make a new quill?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2214a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_lupylliniD_10_n]s.</p>
