          <p>Undead soldiers? Surely not the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_Skeleton_34_An]s?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't believe it! My brother, he...those monsters. Two creatures that I hate most now wait for me at Dryrock! This can't be happening! I can't go! I just can't go!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please...please go back there and destroy them for me. My nerves are shot and there's no way I'll be able to protect Grabakr knowing they are there.</p>
