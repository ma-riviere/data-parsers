          <p>Tensions in the city are so high right now, it's nearly killed my social life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to meet friends at Bivarus Tavern to play cards at least once a week, but nobody goes in there anymore. Well, except for Yohar, but he's always there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not complaining. You and your people are welcome here, truly. I know Kahrun has a plan, and I trust him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Things have to settle down eventually, right?</p>
