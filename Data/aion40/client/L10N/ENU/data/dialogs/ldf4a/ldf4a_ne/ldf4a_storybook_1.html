          <p> Chapter 1. The Origin of Atreia</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is unknown how Atreia was created.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can only guess from ancient fossils that a variety of animals and plants appeared in Atreia as early as the beginning of time and that Atreia was warm and rich in water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not long after Atreia was created did Sapiens such as Balaur, Krall, and Mau, and humankind, the founder of current Elyos, appear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These early residents of Atreia seem to have lived their own lives, without serious conflicts, near the rivers and in the plains.</p>

          <p> Chapter 2. The Growth of Balaur</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With excellent adaptability to harsh environment and strong power, the Balaur expanded their influence throughout Atreia and had a strong hold on other races.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As some of the Balaur ascended, although we do not know when and why they did, and formed a ruling class called Five Dragon Lords, the Balaur established a strong ruling system encompassing the entire Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such growth of the Balaur may be proved by the trend that the ruins of ancient Sapiens including Krall and Mau, became more concentrated on the rites to the Five Dragon Lords and adopted more Balaur patterns as time went by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Humans seem to have resisted the ruling Balaur and developed their own society and culture.</p>

          <p> Chapter 3. History of Resistance: the Millennium Wars</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur rulers started to believe that they were not only chosen by an unfathomable will that governs the world but also controlled by the will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They thought that the Aion Tower represented the will and so they could overcome their limits if they destroyed the tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When they were trying to attack the Aion Tower, the Twelve Empyrean Lords suddenly appeared on the tower and many divine miracles followed. For instance, the Aetheric Field was formed around the tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At the same time, some Humans started to ascend as Daevas for unknown reasons and organized their race. Humans quickly expanded their influence and became as strong as to compete with the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From that moment started a long period of conflict called the Millennium Wars, in which the Twelve Empyrean Lords and Humans fought against the Balaur, Krall and Mau, in full measure.</p>

          <p> Chapter 4. The Birth of the Empyrean Lords</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As briefly mentioned in Chapter 3, nothing is certain about the birth of the Twelve Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We only know that the Empyrean Lords suddenly appeared near the Aion Tower and protected the tower from the attacking Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Closely connected with Daevas and Humans ever since, the Twelve Empyrean Lords have taught them wisdom and technology and played a significant role in forming today's Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A friendly relationship among the Twelve Empyrean Lords did not go so long. Siel, the Protector of Tower, and Israphel were sacrificed during the Cataclysm, and the conflicting opinions over the accident divided the remaining ten Empyrean Lords into two groups. As a result, today's Five Empyrean Lords have put roots down in our world.</p>
