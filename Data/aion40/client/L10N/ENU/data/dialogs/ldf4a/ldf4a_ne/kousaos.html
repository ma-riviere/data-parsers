          <p>I know what you're thinking: what are hunters doing here when Daevas would be better suited for the task?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we hunters have just as much skill as any Ranger at stealth, tracking, and trapping.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>It also frees Daevas up for even more hazardous tasks. I'm proud to do my part for Atreia.</p>
