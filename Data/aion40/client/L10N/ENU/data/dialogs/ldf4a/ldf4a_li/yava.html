          <p>I've never been a big fan of magic. Why waste time and energy casting a healing spell when a nice potion can do the job instantly?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that magic doesn't have its place, but not everyone can cast spells. Everyone can drink, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Any of my items can help in battle, though. Try them out, you won't be disappointed!</p>
