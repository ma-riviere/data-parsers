          <p>Bealara lounged in her room, the events of the day whirling in her head. All this time, she thought Ergvard was a normal Shulack, like her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he had a deep, dark secret, one that Bealara now knew--a secret that would shake the very foundation of the small village in which they lived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She knew that she should tell someone. Her father, her chieftain, the local Drakan governor... anyone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So why hadn't she? Why was she not doing her duty, protecting her family?</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>She was in love with Ergvard.</p>

          <p>A cold breeze blew through the room, and Bealara shivered. Hadn't she closed the window?</p>
          <p> </p>  
          <p>Now, it hung wide open. Ergvard squatted on the windowsill, as he had for many nights.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He smiled, his white fangs gleaming in the evening starlight, and he hopped down onto the floor.</p>
          <p> </p>  
          <p>"I'm sorry it's so late. I just had to see you."</p>

          <p>"But why? I am so boring, I am so plain-looking." Bealara blinked her deep, limpid purple orbs as her gleaming claws swept back her lustrous locks of fur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"No, no! You are the most beautiful creature I have ever laid eyes on."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>'Oh, he is so adorable,' Bealara thought. 'I could get lost forever in his embrace!'</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Please!" she cried. "Let me be lost forever in your embrace!"</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You know what you want. I love that in a Shulack," Ergvard said with a fangy grin.</p>

          <p>Bealara stepped forward, her arms outstretched... but she stopped. "But no!" she cried. "I cannot! For you see... I know your secret!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ergvard's smile twitched. "My secret? I do not keep any secrets from you. You already know everything about me. I am a dashing but mysterious stranger who recently moved to your village. My family is loving but slightly odd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"We are perfectly normal, except for that one thing we do... and maybe that other, but normal. What secret could I possibly have?"</p>     
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Do not lie to me!" Bealara sobbed. "I love you too much! Yet I know that you are... a monster!"</p>

          <p>"A monster?" Ergvard laughed. "But I am no monster! I am just a Shulack like you!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bealara clutched at Ergvard's sleek, muscular arm. "No! You cannot keep up this pretense any longer! I was a fool not to see the signs!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You disappear for days on end without explaining where! You have strength far greater than any Shulack!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You know things from thousands of years ago! Your fur sparkles in the sunlight!</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>"There is only one explanation for all of this! You are... a Daeva!"</p>

          <p>Ergvard tried to laugh, but the sound rang hollow in his throat. "A Daeva? How silly! Shulacks cannot be Daevas!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"So you weren't a Shulack before. We all know about magic that can change your shape. The mighty Dragon Lords use it all the time."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But don't Daevas hate Shulacks? If I were one, why would I still be here?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Maybe... you have seen that Balaur and Shulacks aren't as bad as you think. Maybe you see that we are worthy to lead Atreia as rightful rulers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Maybe you already said it yourself.... Maybe... you love me...."</p>

          <p>There was a long silence. Ergvard stared at Bealara. Bealara stared blankly at Ergvard. Finally, after what seemed like ages....</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>"You're right," he whispered, "about everything. I am a Daeva. I was struck by a shapeshifting spell and locked into this form.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"And I did come to see how much the Dragon Lords and the Shulack truly care about the world, and want to lead it with a firm hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But most of all... you were right about how much I love you. I have followed you everywhere without you knowing. I have watched you sleep from outside your window.</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>"That proves I love you as much as a former Human turned into a Sapien can love another Shulack."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"You've been spying on me? Stalking me?" Bealara gasped. "That's... that's so romantic!"</p>

          <p>The two caught each other up in a passionate embrace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Oh, Ergvard!" Bealara cried. "I am so happy! You know, I am studying engineering and am being groomed to work at Aturam Sky Fortress!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But does that mean you'll have to leave me?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"I never thought of it that way! You're right! I'll just quit and give up all my studies!"</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But such a job would turn you into an independent Shulack, making a valuable contribution to..."</p>     
          <p> </p>
          <p>"I will serve the Dragon Lords by making monster hybrid babies with you! You are more important than anything!"</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>"Oh, Ergvard! If only all Daevas were as smart as you to realize that the Dragon Lords should reign over all Atreia!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But wait!" Ergvard looked into the eyes of his love. "What about Jikil? Your Nojolf friend?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Oh, he has feelings for me, but I'll keep him hanging just in case this doesn't work out."</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Isn't that a little selfish and cruel?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bealara shrugged. "I am a Shulack. So sue me."</p>

          <p>"Your life with me won't be easy," Ergvard said. "My legion knows about this village and aren't as enlightened as I am."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Then that means you will have to fight against your own people?" Bealara gasped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Yes, but I will. What are thousands of years of close ties compared to the love of someone I've known for about two and a half months?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Of course! Obviously we are going to be together forever, and we'll never regret or stray or doubt!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Why would we? We're in love! That's all that matters!"</p>
