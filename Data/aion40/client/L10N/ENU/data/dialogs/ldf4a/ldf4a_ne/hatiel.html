          <p>These Wastes were the ancient site of a giant Jotun city, built upon the skirts of the great Jotari Sanctuary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is not clear what destroyed this flourishing culture, nor leveled the landmarks that once scraped the sky with their spires.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is some evidence that it could have been factional infighting, the Jotun destroying their own history.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my Kinah is on the Balaur having something to do with it.</p>
