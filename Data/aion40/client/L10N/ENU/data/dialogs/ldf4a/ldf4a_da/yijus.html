          <p>This relationship with the Reians is much too complicated. I'm not so sure if we did the right thing teaming up with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reians keep to themselves and restrict sharing information, more often than not. Admirable diplomacy starts from honesty, but the Reian tribe takes just the opposite approach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd really like the Fatebound Brigade General to disclose what they're up to.</p>
