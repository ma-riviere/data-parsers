          <p>It's hard keeping a warehouse on a ship, even one as big as the Habrok. We can only store so much without making it overweight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some items I store in Pandaemonium, and use portals and messengers to retrieve them as needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's inconvenient, but necessary. But enough about the details. How may I serve you?</p>
