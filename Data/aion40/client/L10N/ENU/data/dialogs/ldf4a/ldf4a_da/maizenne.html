          <p>I didn't mean to come to Sarpan, but I was intrigued by the claims that this place has lots of relics. So here I stay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's great! I'm collecting lots and lots of relics as I hoped!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you bring in any relics, [%username]? I oversee the Ancient Crowns, so if you have a crown, give it to me.</p>
