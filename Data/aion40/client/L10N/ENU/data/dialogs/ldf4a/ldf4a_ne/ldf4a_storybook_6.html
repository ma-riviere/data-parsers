            <p> </p> 
            <p>I've been asked by the council of Elders to learn more about the Humnaz Tribe, and have entered into a one-sided culture exchange.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Elders ordered me to ingratiate myself to the Tribe in hopes that I'll be invited to live among them. According to Tanitia at the Disguised Humnaz Outpost, this is improbable.</p> 
            <p> </p>
            <p>Instead, she has proposed that I kill one of their sentries and wear his armor, declaring myself an honorary Calydon. I think it might work.</p>

            <p> </p> 
            <p>Tanitia steered me to an ambush spot, where I laid in wait for a Humnaz Sentry.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>With superior Reian magic, weaponry, and intelligence, I quickly dispatched him. I then shed all my first-rate accessories in favor of the Sentry's spear and crossed-leather vest.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>I thought about shaving off his tusks and carrying them as proof of my deed, but it felt disrespectful.</p>     
            <p> </p>
            <p>Over the next few hours, I was attacked by numerous Calydons. I don't know whether they were friends of the deceased or if they just liked fighting.</p>

        	<p>Because if one thing is certain, it's that Calydons like fighting.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Thanks again to Reian excellence, I defeated all comers. After I'd mopped up one whole mob of Humnaz, a watching Shaman burst into laughter and approached me. I crouched, ready for another fight, but he merely slung an odiferous arm around my shoulders.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>"Not a piglet," he decreed. "But a mighty warrior!"</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Under the literal arm of his approval, this Shaman brought me before Chieftain Haridoo and had me declared a member of the tribe, forged in battle.</p>

          <p align="center"><b>Humnaz History</b></p>  
            <p> </p> 
            <p>The current site of Humnaz settlement was not their first in Sarpan. Originally, they'd built huts in the Trepone Forest, long before any Reians inhabited that area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reian history and Humnaz oral tradition both agree on this point. It's well known that early Reian settlements in Trepone came under attack from the native Calydons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While they were happy to fight and squabble with our people, whom they outnumbered, they were overwhelmed by Tiamat's forces. This explains their choice in moving to the barren lands they occupy today.</p>

            <p> </p>
            <p>There's only one way to advance in the Humnaz Tribe: defeating the Calydon above you in battle.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>For particularly important positions, such as Chieftain, this fight continues until either the incumbent or the challenger is dead.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>In my case, I started as a lowly Sentry. I quickly worked my way up to third in command of the entire Tribe. Most Calydons are no match for Reians one-on-one.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>The Humnaz being so feudal, my position as Third means something. If I tell a Warrior to kill his favorite Tog, he must do so. He can't refuse, unless he challenges my authority with his weapons.</p>

        		<p>Avoid, avoid, avoid. Remember, he mercilessly defeated and killed all opponents to reach the pinnacle of his society. For all his smarts and fairness, he's a dangerous fellow. If you do end up dueling with him, Siel preserve you, run fast if he calls up a sandstorm.</p>

        		<p> </p>
        		<p>Budugum is Haridoo's second in command. He is notorious for putting would-be chieftains in their place. No one has passed Budugum to get to Haridoo in years--so they tell me. If anyone ever challenges Haridoo again, it will likely be his second.</p>
        		<p> </p>
        		<p><b>3. Clairvoyant Sunachu</b></p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No mere marksman, Sunachu can hit a moving target accurately every time. They call him "Clairvoyant" because he's rumored to see around obstacles using mystical powers. You can't hide.</p>

          <p>Dumuch stays outside the warrior command structure and sits atop the pile of magic-users. Think of him as a high-level Sorcerer.</p>

        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>The Humnaz Tribe takes fighting very seriously. Their warrior cult concentrates on what was, what is, and what will be.</p>
        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>They have one shrine to the Ancestors--Those Who Have Fought Before Us--and look to those past Calydons for guidance in battle. There is another shrine to the Warrior--Those Who Fight With Us--where they essentially worship the current chief.</p>
        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>Most interesting is the shrine to the Yearling--The Shrine of Next Season's Dead. Never before have I seen a culture that forms a cult around future generations.</p>

        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>Many Reians passing through notice that the shrines may contain a piece of a Petralith. But do not be fooled into thinking that the Humnaz worship idols.</p>
        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>While they are spiritual and focused, they don't worship any invisible gods, not even Aion!</p>
        	 <p> </p>
        	 <p>When they came across a piece of a Petralith, they saw how big it was, how strong and fierce. Rightly, they decided it fit with their ideals and added its symbolism to their shrines. The Petraliths support the cult, not cause it.</p>

        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Here in Humnaz-land, we do a lot of dancing. As third in command, it's my duty to lead and initiate any number of dances. Thankfully, Budugum helped me understand the practice.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>There are two types of dances: for the shrines and for the competition.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>The dance for the shrines is obvious. Since all warriors must have coordination and strength, each Calydon makes his or her most technically difficult offering to the Ancestors, Warriors, or Yearlings.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>These individual dances vary widely based on the ability and style of the Tribe member performing. Any living audience--save Haridoo if he shows up at the Warrior shrine--can be ignored.</p>

        	<p>The dance for competition is much more complex.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>It shares its principle with the shrine dance: warriors must show coordination, strength, and technical ability. However, the execution is very different.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>For the competition, warriors band together to dance in unison. Their ability to work as a team mimics their smooth cooperation in the field.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Chieftain Haridoo can declare a competition at any time, but he usually gives a day or two's notice. Still, we practice constantly. Competition winners are revered.</p>
