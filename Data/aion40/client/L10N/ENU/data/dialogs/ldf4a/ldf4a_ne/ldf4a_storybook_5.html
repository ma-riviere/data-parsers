          <p>My dearest Oriata,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, how the days stretch on without you. But, when the Elders call, a Reian flies to answer the summons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What if they want me to join the war against Tiamat? A worthy cause, of course, but what do I know about fighting a war? I know only that people die, and enough Reians have died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(A sentence is scratched out, and the letter resumes in a different shade of ink.)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, the Elders wanted me to fight against our enemies. How could I have doubted it? Do you know how important the war effort is?</p>

          <p>I'm in a unit under a lieutenant named Kahrun. He's fresh in the field, just like me, but he has some amazing ideas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Together, we'll strike a blow so hard, Tiamat will leave our lands for good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you're staying safe in the Temple, my love. I'll be back in Kamar as soon as Tiamat is defeated.</p>

          <p>(You wonder if this Laso is still out fighting or if he's turned in his resignation. Because Tiamat sure isn't defeated yet and this letter is centuries old.)</p>

          <p>We haven't seen much action yet--just one Drakan that Kahrun dealt with handily. That young kid takes the enemy head on! It's impressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Much more important, I've joined the regimental band! Whenever I pull out my ocarina, I think of your sweet face, lips pursed as you taught me to play.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The red that enemy Drakan doth spill</p>
          <p>Reminds me of your ruby lips... and grass</p>

          <p>More sweetness than a barman's cider mill.</p>
          <p>No souvenir of lustrous meat shall last;</p>
          <p>And trophies of this ilk, they too shall pass</p>
          <p>While on we march to defy Ti'mat's will.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's talk of happy things. Some of my comrades and I have decided to open a bar when we get back home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll be the kind of place where you can relax with friends. We'll have good drinks and good music, and people will come from the farthest outskirts just to meet with friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We haven't decided what to call it yet. I wanted "Laso's Place," but the others thought I was crazy. "Galam Ga-bar" also came up, but that's a terrible name. Do you have any suggestions?</p>

          <p>But I thought you'd planned to stay in Kamar at the temple. Weren't you organizing all the healing tents and medical sites? Without you here, the Humans will probably be ignored, and the Daevas will get told "die and call me in the morning" for even the smallest wounds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to miss you terribly. We'll go sit in the park when you get back, right?</p>

          <p>Thank you for the suggestions in your last letter. The boys and I have agreed that your Bivarus Tavern is a great name. All those "v" sounds!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>V for Victory, we think.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>We met up with another troop the other day, fresh out of Kamar, and they had stories of hometown priests covered in blood, drowning under a tide of wounded. They spoke of overwhelmed healers at home and an end to the Human Treatment Program.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can't have known this would happen. The mainstay of your tenure as Head Priestess of Siel's Temple has always been treatment for Humans. "Humans will someday ascend," you told me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But these are the exigencies of war: battlefield priests and dead generations.</p>

          <p>But whenever it does, know that you carry my love and my sympathy. When the war is over, when Tiamat has been driven out, we will mourn together and make joyful moments to replace these horrors.</p>
