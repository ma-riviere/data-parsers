          <p>I can't believe what happened to Veille. But that's the power of the Dragon Lords for you.</p>

          <p>To see it first hand... at least now we have a better idea of what we're up against.</p>

          <p>That I do not know. I have had no word from Sanctum as to her condition.</p>

          <p>Hopefully, she'll be fine. If not, the Griffoen will cut a swath through Tiamaranta in her name.</p>

          <p>Balaur, Asmodian, Tiamat herself... it won't matter. They'll all fall. For Veille and Lord Kaisinel!</p>
