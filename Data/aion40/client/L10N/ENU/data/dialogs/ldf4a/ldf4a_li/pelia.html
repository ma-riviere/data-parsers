          <p>All Daevas have certain things they're really good at. For some, it's combat, for others, magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if there's one thing I know, it's Ancient Crowns. I can spot the smallest flaw or tell you exactly when it was first made.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like a demonstration of my skills? I can give you rewards for your Crown in the bargain!</p>

          <p>Really, Daeva, I'm not stupid! I know what Ancient Crowns look like, and you don't have any!</p>

          <p>I choose to believe that you weren't trying to trick me, and will await you bringing back some real Ancient Crowns.</p>
