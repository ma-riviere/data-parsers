          <p>Aetheric magic is so wonderful. Without it, Warehouses like mine wouldn't be possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine having to go to an actual physical Warehouse to get your goods? Nothing would get done!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So please, even as you use my services, appreciate what makes it possible. Don't take it for granted.</p>
