          <p>Do you know how long I've been dealing with and examining Ancient Goblets? So long that I can appraise one at just a glance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, my speed tends to make Daevas skeptical, and it often leaves me a lot of time with nothing to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't mind that. Gives me time to think. Or maybe you want me to demonstrate my expertise with Ancient Goblets...?</p>

          <p>Whether you have any or not--and you don't--makes no difference to me. But it probably does make some difference to you.</p>
