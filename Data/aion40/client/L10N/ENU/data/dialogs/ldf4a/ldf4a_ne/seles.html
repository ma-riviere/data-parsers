          <p>I see people's looks of awe over what I craft, but I don't see my items with those same eyes. There is no perfection in the world of crafting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even master crafters have mishaps, make bad choices, suffer bad luck. Some would say it's those imperfections that make a piece special. Perfection is simply that fantasy for which we strive, off somewhere in a faraway place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even knowing we can never reach it, we push nonetheless. We're like little clowns on a long journey searching for the rainbow.</p>
