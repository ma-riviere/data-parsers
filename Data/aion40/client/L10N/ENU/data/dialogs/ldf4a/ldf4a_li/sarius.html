          <p>Strange, isn't it, to be so close to the furbacks--er, Asmodians--and not be fighting them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun insisted on this arrangement. We're supposed to be showing Kamar a "unified front," no matter how false it may be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, if the Balaur were to attack... I know we would fight well side-by-side. Makes you think, doesn't it?</p>
