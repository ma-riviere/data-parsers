          <p>Welcome. Let all who step into this holy space--Reian, Asmodian, or Elyos--give thanks to Lady Siel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She who helped preserve our world. She who sacrificed all in order to save all.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>She lives on in us all, as long as time moves forward--forward towards the final defeat of the Dragon Lords.</p>
