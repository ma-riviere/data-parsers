	        <p>Now I'll fetch you something from my inventory. It might not be to your tastes, but I'm sure you'll learn to appreciate its strengths.</p>

	        <p>If you don't like the item, remember you can always sell it to any merchant. Some items will fetch a bit of Kinah, too!</p>

	        <p>To do that would be to completely undermine our system.</p>
