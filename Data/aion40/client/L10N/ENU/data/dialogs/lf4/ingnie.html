          <p>Our Elyos brothers and sisters deserve a hearty congratulations on their recent triumphs. But they must keep their eyes open and their swords in hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Elyos are a proud people.... We fight hard and we revel in our victories. But now is not the time for rejoicing. Now is the time for rebuilding our armies!</p>

          <p>The Balaur remain quiet...and that's what scares me most.</p>
