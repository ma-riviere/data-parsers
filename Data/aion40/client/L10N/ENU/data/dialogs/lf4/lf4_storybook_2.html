          <p>Song of Three Sages</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a song about the three sages who led my people to safety during the dark, desperate days of the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I, Galais, wrote this song with much sadness in my heart. I wrote it in hopes that one day our great struggle will be remembered by all....</p>

          <p>Hagia, Aran and Raniwu were named the three sages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the day the sky split, they fell here with but a ball of string, a flute, and book pages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Despair threw some of their fellows over the cliff while the Balaur darkened the others for ages.</p>

          <p>Hagia shouted to my people, "Tonight, let the tree bark keep you warm,"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As Aran cried to the Balaur beasts, "You devils will be tamed by the coming storm!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Raniwu picked up his sword and swung at the approaching shadowed form.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>As mothers, fathers, and kin prepared for the coming attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the three sages gathered arms for what the survivors did lack.</p>

          <p>And Raniwu collected the food as the enemy grew nigh.</p>

          <p>In the dark of that creeping night, a new village my people did find.</p>

          <p>The distance far from the Balaur, no one did seem to mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"We'll call our new home the 'Village of Three Sages'," they said in kind.</p>

          <p>Teach your children song and dance, but always prepare for the coming of strife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In one hand the sun and moon, in the other the sharpened knife.</p>

          <p>And the forests screamed in fire and rage, a warning no one could ignore.</p>

          <p>Curse the gods and sages they did, the Balaur they made glad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only Hagia remained, and carried to safety every girl and young lad.</p>

          <p>But this sad song I sing, I sing for love and not for hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For if this is the will of Aion, perhaps her love is not too late.</p>
