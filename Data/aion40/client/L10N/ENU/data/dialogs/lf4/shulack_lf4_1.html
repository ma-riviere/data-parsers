          <p>My little sister, Setzkiki, and I, we ran from the Balaur and came here. We figured here would be better than there, but we were wrong. There, death is fast. Here, it is slow. As slow as starvation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are both hungry, but Setzkiki is sick and has lost much of her hair. The Soul Healer said that Setzkiki needs more good healthy food. That she will be better if she eats more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have tried to find her more food. I ask for food. I try to work for food. I have even tried to steal food. That...that ended badly.</p>
