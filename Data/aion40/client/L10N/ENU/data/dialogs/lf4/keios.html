          <p>Your [%mainslotitem] looks very comforting to a Daeva preparing for a Balaur attack at any moment.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur are refusing to retreat from the Altar of Avarice, and we need more soldiers here to fend off their impending attack.</p>
