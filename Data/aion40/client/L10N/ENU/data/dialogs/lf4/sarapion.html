          <p>This war will never end, Daeva. It will never end because we are not defending our homeland--we are invading Balaur land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are not righteous in this pursuit. The Balaur are a worthy adversary, some of the fiercest foes I've ever come up against.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I watched many brave Daevas fall at the hands of the Balaur...bloodied, slashed, face-down in the muck. A damn worthy adversary they are.</p>
