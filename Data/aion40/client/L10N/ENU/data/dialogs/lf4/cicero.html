          <p>Ever thought about the ground here? I don't understand how everyone can be so damn calm about it.</p>

          <p>Look around you! This village sits on the edge of a massive fissure...a thin blanket of cracks and loose soil. This isn't safe!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just look at those neighboring regions over there! They're not safe either! How this whole damn place doesn't swallow itself up is beyond me.</p>
