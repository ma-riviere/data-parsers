          <p>Don't think of Soteria Sanctuary as a town hastily built on top of an old, shabby reliquary. See it for what it really is: perfectly situated for holding off Balaur and Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ragged mountains shield us from Drakan eyes. A nearby fissure and a desolate desert protect us from stealth attacks. The ground we stand on even survived Tiamat's butchery intact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like the Reian Tribe's ancestral protectors, we use the dilapidated village to mask our attack force!</p>
