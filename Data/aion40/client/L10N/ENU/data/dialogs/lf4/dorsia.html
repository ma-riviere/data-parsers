          <p>You want something to worry about? Worry about how the insufficient Aether supply cripples us in battle. That's why we haven't launched an attack on Tiamat yet, you know. Maybe we never will, Kaisinel or no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So here we are, Daevas of Life, trying to secure enough Aether so Elyos can fight in comfort. And we even know there's a powerful Aether source in that forest over there, but we can't reach it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes, Daeva...sometimes.</p>
