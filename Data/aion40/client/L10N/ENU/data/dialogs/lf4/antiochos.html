          <p>If you're a Spiritmaster or a Sorcerer, I have plenty of armor and weapons here. If you're a different class, I'm sure there's a Steward somewhere around here that can help you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Personally, I would give the brave soldiers fighting in Balaurea everything I have for free...but I can't. I work for coins, you see.</p>
