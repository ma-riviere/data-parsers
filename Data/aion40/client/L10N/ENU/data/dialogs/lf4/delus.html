          <p>Balaurea...what a brown pit of sorrow this place is. Although, I must say, I am starting to get used to it...the battles, the thick air, the odd weather.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But one thing that I cannot get used to is Doria's cooking! I've never tasted food so disgusting! I caught her boiling a rock! Actually boiling a rock! That's not soup!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it too much to ask for a decent cook here?</p>
