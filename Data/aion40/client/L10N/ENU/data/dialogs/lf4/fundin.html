          <p>You've no doubt heard rumors of Fundin the Fearless in Gelkmaros? Well, you are in for a treat, for it is I, Fundin! Yes, I know, I would be speechless as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? We...know each other? I apologize. If I were to keep track of all the people I have saved from certain death, I wouldn't have time to save them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have no fear, for Tiamat's reign of terror in Balaurea is soon to end. I, Fundin, shall smite him!</p>
