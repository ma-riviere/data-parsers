          <p>Oh, you're going to challenge the Empyrean Crucible? Good luck to you, is all I can say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can send you as far as the Kaisinel Academy, that's 9,300 Kinah. No idea why they charge so much, but I guess if you're good enough to try the out Crucible, that's probably a drop in the bucket for you.</p>

          <p>9,300 Kinah. Is it that difficult to remember? Sorry to be testy, but I have a lot going on and I could really do without this kind of time-wasting.</p>
