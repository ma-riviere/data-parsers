          <p>Those Daevas of Life.... I'm not very fond of them. It's nothing personal, I just don't agree with their methods.</p>

          <p>There's no reason why only they get to explore new territories looking for Aether. My legion is more than capable of handling that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, we all share the same fate now, I suppose. But I'm still going to keep my eye on them.</p>
