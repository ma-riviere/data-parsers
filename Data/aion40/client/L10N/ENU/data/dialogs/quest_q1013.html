          <p>I'm glad to see you. We could really use the help of a skilled [%userclass]. I take it you've heard of the Lepharist Revolutionaries?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some would have you believe they're little more than bandits. That's not true. They're well armed, highly trained, and treacherous. They preach revolt against Sanctum, the destruction of our government...even outright defiance of the Seraphim Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And some of our people are beginning to listen to them.</p>

          <p>Like all racketeers, they cluster in small groups and work from hidden power bases.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When they first took Belbua's Farm, people thought they were just looters. But they're dug in, entrenched, with plenty of supplies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now they're approaching the villagers, saying they only want to "talk,"...seeding doubt and fear. "Why does Sanctum want to suppress us?" they ask. "Can't they tolerate free speech?"</p>

        <body>
          <p>Freedom of speech is all very well, but we can't tolerate conspiracy and sedition. These people are a pestilence and must be stopped! Centurion Leto, one of our Guardians, has done her best to hold them off, but she needs reinforcements, and Sanctum seems unwilling to listen. Some of the villagers have formed a Watch to aid her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there's only so much we can do. Our people haven't had it easy lately, and unhappy people are easy prey for the Lepharists. Make no mistake; they will capitalize on every ember of resentment, every splinter of jealousy our people have ever felt toward us, their protectors.</p>

          <p>Drive the Revolutionaries out of [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA24]. Start small and work your way up. Take out a [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA122]% or two. They're vermin, [%username]. Show no mercy.</p>

          <p>First they take an honest man's farm, and now they try to swell their ranks by force!</p>

          <p>It seems the Lepharist plan to establish a base near Tolbas Village has gone up in smoke, doesn't it? What a dreadful shame. How awful for them.</p>
