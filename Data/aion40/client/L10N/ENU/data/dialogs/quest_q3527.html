          <p>Greetings, [%username]. I was about to call for you. I have a favor to ask.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear from the Blue Fleet that the spirits of fallen sailors still wander the Stenon Bay? Is it true that they remain in that undead state because they were cursed by Bollvig?</p>

          <p>Ohh, those poor souls. Forever stuck wandering the land...never returning to the Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have discussed this matter with their families, and they have agreed to let us...return our brave Daevas to the Aether. Which means we must kill them...our own people. Remember, they are not who they once were.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. You will bring peace to the destroyed sailors' families.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Leave now for Stenon Bay and return the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadLightFi_44_An_2]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadLightWi_44_An_2]s back to the flow of Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I know, I know...what I've asked of you is indeed uncomfortable and highly dangerous. But it is a Daeva's duty to watch over Humans, is it not?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at Old Heraloene over there. Ever since he heard of his son's death, he just wanders around and begs to see him again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could help his fallen son find some peace, he might regain his sanity. Please reconsider. I will beg if I must.</p>

          <p>Forgive me, [%username]. You must be tired. You don't need to stand there and listen to an old woman moan about her troubles. How did things go in Stenon Bay?</p>

          <p>This is all that the villagers could afford to give. It isn't much, considering what you have done for us, but please take it.</p>
