          <p>I'd like you to take a message to Ellino on the Standard Server, if you're going back in that direction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell him, I have some leave coming up, and I'd like to come for a visit if that's okay with him. I can bring my own bedroll and sleep on his couch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's easy enough to get back. Just go to "Menu," then "Go to Channel," and then "Go to Standard Server."</p>
