        <p>We minister to many gravely hurt warriors in our work. And we see firsthand that a true Asmodian laughs at wounds.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Indeed, some ordeals of the flesh are disguised blessings, for they can trigger the latent Daeva within and prompt ascension.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Ordeals of the heart, too, can rip asunder what is mortal and free the Daeva within. Tell me truthfully, [%username]. What was it that triggered your ascension?</p>

          <p>Munin! Munin the exile? That name is anathema!</p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>[%username], I had heard tongues wagging wickedly about you. Now I see your choices set those tongues into motion. Is Munin the sort you choose to associate with?</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Munin has many enemies. His prophecy concerning the Thirteenth Empyrean Lord turned many hearts against him.</p>

          <p>Hush, young stormcrow. If you sow breezes, you will reap hurricanes. Where Munin is concerned, it is better to remain silent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you're too busy to linger on such indiscretions. Asmodae needs you, [%username], and to excel in the service of Asmodae is to honor those who made us so strong in the first place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your chance to serve has already come. I have been ordered to dispatch you to Altgard Fortress.</p>

          <p>A sense of humor will serve you well in Altgard. It is a bleak place, and it could surely use some of your youthful levity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe someone is trying to keep you out of the way. You are a known associate of Mu...of a certain exile, after all.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], turn this challenge to your advantage. Work hard in Altgard, wear away what remains of your mortal softness, and in time you will be strong enough to face the Abyss. Are you ready for Altgard?</p>
