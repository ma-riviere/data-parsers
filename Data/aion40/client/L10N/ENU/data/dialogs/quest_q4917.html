          <p>Without you I'd never have had the chance to be at the forefront of this groundbreaking research, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I owe much of my success to your continued willingness to travel to and from Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be publishing my preliminary results soon, and of course I'm giving you a prominent mention.</p>

          <p>I'm not unaware that I've taken terrible advantage of you, and that until now I've been unable to repay your kindness in more...material ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you heard of Chopirunerk, of the Tigraki Workshop? He's quite interested in Drana for its possible use in the design of new weapons and armor. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think he might be willing to engage your services to find something for him in Dark Poeta next time you're there. Would you like to meet him? </p>
