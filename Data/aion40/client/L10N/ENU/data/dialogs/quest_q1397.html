          <p>There was a time when I'd have rather clipped my own wings than beg for help. But the days when I could afford that kind of arrogance are far behind me.</p>

          <p>Those infernal Lepharists have become a force to be reckoned with. Their [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparFiSoldier_38_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AeC_LehparAsSoldier_39_An]s act as though they own this area, and if you don't help us stop them, I suppose they do.</p>
