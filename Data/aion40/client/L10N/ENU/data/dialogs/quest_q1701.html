          <p>You expected my call, I presume? You're sure to have heard about our troubles by this point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our goal is for the Elyos to dominate Reshanta, which requires eliminating both the Asmodians and the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We mustn't allow either faction so much as a single fortress in a single region.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this--it is the list of missions I'm requiring you carry out. All the details are included. Remember, I expect nothing but the best.</p>
