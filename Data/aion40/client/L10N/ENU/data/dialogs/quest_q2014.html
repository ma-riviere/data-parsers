          <p>During our last patrol, we discovered Lepharist Revolutionaries around [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_5]. It looked to me like they were organizing search parties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know there are a few Lepharist rabble-rousers near Altgard, but we've never seen them in Moslan Forest before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Commander Suthran is already breathing down our necks about the MuMu tribe, and now we have to deal with this....</p>

          <p>The "plan" is a new mission for you: find out what brought the Lepharists to Moslan Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think they're looking for something. Figure out what the Lepharists are searching for, and I'll bet we'll learn what their overall plan is.</p>

          <p>Head northwest and you will see [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_5]. Go north from there, and you will find the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interrogating them probably won't work--they're fanatics, after all. But they might have orders, plans, or other clues in Manir's house, which they're using as a headquarters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Search every corner of that house and bring back whatever you find.</p>

          <p>Tiamat's Sword? Legend has it that a Balaur general dropped it during the Millennium War, but no one knows where it fell to earth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought the sword was merely a treasure-seeker's folktale. You say the Lepharists actually have it?</p>

          <p>They wouldn't want it as a museum piece, that's for sure. The Lepharists' motive must be more...sinister.</p>
