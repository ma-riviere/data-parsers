          <p>Our Archons report there are more than a few Elyos in Brusthonin. We've got our work cut out for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither Pandaemonium nor Reshanta can send us reinforcements. On the other hand, based on your report and the Archons' intelligence, the Elyos face a tough situation as well. There's no way to get supplies from Elysea. And the environment here is not optimal for self-sufficiency--at least not for light-softened Elyos.</p>

          <p>I hope I can count on your help again, [%username]. We can't dispatch Archons--we need them to prepare for the Elyos' attack.</p>

        <p>Your skills are impressive and your stealth is our best chance to assassinate the Ellie in question. Will you help us?</p>

          <p>You can approach this in one of two ways--by yourself, if you're confident your skills are up to the challenge, or with a team of your colleagues. A team could cause some serious chaos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm happy either way. As long as you get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LightDevaWiBossNmdD_25_Ae].</p>
