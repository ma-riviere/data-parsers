          <p>You should see a researcher named Kushar, in Pandaemonium. He studies the Lepharist Revolutionaries, but he's better known as a disciple of Arch Sage Cavalorn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I reported to my superiors that someone called Atla was trapped in the Alquimia Stronghold, it was Kushar who financed the rescue operation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what do you say? Will you go there and let him know?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Saves me a trip to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DC1_12]. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kushar] is generous for a scholar. There could be some nice Kinah in it for you once he hears the news.</p>
          <p> </p>
