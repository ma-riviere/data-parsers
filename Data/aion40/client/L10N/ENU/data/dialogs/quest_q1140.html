          <p>You ever meet Belbua? Nice, old-fashioned farmer, and he made this great wine....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm worried about him, though, with the troubles and all. I haven't seen him for days, and there's these hoodlums running around his farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think you could look for him for me?</p>

          <p>Well, I wouldn't be much good at tellin' you what he looks like, but he's got these odd habits.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like he talks to plants sometimes when he thinks nobody's around, and he's got this scarecrow--sometimes he acts like it's alive....</p>

          <p>Yeah, he even gave the scarecrow a name. Calls it Nola.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I even got to believin' in it myself sometimes--felt like it was looking at me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'd put my mind at ease if you go check on Belbua. If he's not at his farm, then hey, maybe you could ask Nola where he's gone! Ha!</p>
