	<p>Collected Iron Coins, have you?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Well, I've items here that'll prove useful for magic users: Sorcerers, Spiritmasters, Clerics, and Chanters. If you want items for the less...refined classes, then you need to speak to Anontrite.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>How many coins do you have exactly?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You can trade in two or four at a time. Obviously, four coins returns a better item, so choose wisely....</p>

	<p>Two coins....</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Well, try this. The items are given out at random and we simply can't exchange them, but if you're unhappy with what you've received, any vendor should be happy to take it off your hands.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You can always try your luck again, or wait until you have collected four coins. Then you'll receive one of our very best items.</p>

	<p>Four coins!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Here's your item, [%userclass]. As you may have heard, we have too many items to catalog, so rewards are given out randomly. If it suits you, good.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If you don't like it, you can always sell it. I hear some of our goods go for quite a bit these days....</p>

	<p>Sorry, I wasn't making myself clear: I reward Sorcerers, Spiritmasters, Clerics, and Chanters. Only those four.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You look to be some kind of [%userclass], so Anontrite's the one to talk to for you.</p>

	<p>I'm sorry, but it's against our policy to exchange items.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Everyone has an equal chance. If we were to change our procedures suddenly, there would be an uproar. Our items can all be sold to traders, though. </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>If you didn't get what you wanted, just get more coins and try again! You never know when your luck will improve.</p>

	<p>You said you had more coins than this, [%userclass].</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You've clearly miscounted, and I can't help you until you've collected the required number of Iron Coins.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Come back when you have them. Until then, stop wasting my time.</p>
