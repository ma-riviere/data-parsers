          <p>Nothing useful grows anymore, so my folks started hunting for food. Well, one day they went out, and Lepharist Revolutionaries took them. Just killed them. Why would they do that? My parents were good people. They were all I had....</p>

          <p>It tears me up just being home, using the tools my parents used. At the same time, the more I think, the angrier I get.</p>

          <p>Those Lepharists, they've brought nothing but misery to this village. And I hear they're doing it everywhere. An' look at what they've done to me, to my life!</p>

	  <p>Here's everything I know. There's a woman who saw my parents' murder. She says their names are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparAsNamed_40_Ae] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparElementalNamed_40_Ae], and they're in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_J].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard they're high-ranking. They don't show up at the Lepharist Bastion often, so it may be hard to find them. Please, this isn't for me. It's for my parents, for everyone taken by the Lepharists. </p>
