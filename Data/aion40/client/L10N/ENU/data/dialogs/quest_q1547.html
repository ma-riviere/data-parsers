          <p>I'm so bored! Being stuck in this campsite with so little to do is driving me crazy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My research is going nowhere until the Klaw Catcher arrives from Sanctum. I need to collect hearts from various species, so I need a specialist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's annoying to have to wait, and she charges a fortune too! Who knew it would cost so much Kinah to get someone to hunt Klaws?!</p>

          <p>Well it's...oh, are you interested? It didn't occur to me to ask you to do such a trivial thing, but I'd gladly give you what I was going to pay her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since I came here, I've found [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutH1_38_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutH2_38_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1_37_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2_37_An]s in the jungle. Each of them has a different role. I don't know whether that role is innate, or determined by the environment. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to study cells from  [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1547UNI]. Could you get them for me?</p>
