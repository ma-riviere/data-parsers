          <p>The attacks on the Dredgion are paying off.</p>

          <p>The commander of the Baranath Legion has dispatched an auditor to the ship to investigate the situation.</p>

          <p>Well, that's true. But it's also a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the auditor discovers how we've been infiltrating the Dredgion and comes up with a countermeasure, we'll lose our advantage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The auditor is our next target. He's not the only one who can learn our secret, but he's the most likely. [%username], will you handle this for us?</p>

        	<p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_DrakanRAInspector_50_Ah] may investigate the whole ship, but he must go to The Bridge to report to his superiors. That's where you're most likely to find him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know, I know--attacking a Balaur auditor in The Bridge of a war ship won't be easy. But we don't have a choice if we want to preserve our advantage.</p>
