          <p>The blade is an essential part of the sword, but it is useless alone. You can't bring the force of a blade to bear without a hilt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Evil Sword is powerful enough to cleave a Drakan in two with a single blow, but a sword without a hilt is just a dangerous lump of steel.</p>

          <p>Agrif gave his all to make the finest hilt. He even cast a spell on it to help restrain the tremendous power of the blade. It controls the blade's five powers by mixing the energy of ice and fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A spell was also cast on the ornament, to unify the conflicted energies of the hilt. But when the Empyrean Lord destroyed the sword, the hilt was sliced in half.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now you must recover the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_06], the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_07], and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_08] that was attached to the hilt.</p>

          <p>Um...pretty sure. The pieces are hidden in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up3_Crotan_SZ_All], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up3_Dkisas_SZ_All], and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up3_LaMiren_SZ_All] respectively. Unfortunately, they're in the hands of the Balaur now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hilt and ornament have great power, but they're useless unless attached to Agrif's Rage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're almost done. Really. Just go and get the last three pieces, [%username].</p>

          <p>I'm actually a little nervous now that the sword is nearing completion. I mean, an Empyrean Lord deemed it dangerous enough to sunder and seal away.</p>

          <p>Aha! The hilt of Agrif's Rage! I remember as if it were yesterday how Agrif toiled to craft it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It looks just the same, except for in two pieces of course. And the ornament...yes, this is it. Honestly, I didn't have much hope you'd be able to get all the fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the work is done, you will be rewarded for your efforts, [%username]. And after I remove the curse, this sword will need a new name.</p>
