          <p>Purra is a small Tayga my father and I have had for years. We brought her with us when we moved from Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My father loves that Tayga so much he grooms her every day. I don't know what he'll do if Purra is missing when he comes home after work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have an idea where Purra might be, but I need your help. Please?</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. I've already searched the places I can reach. I need someone to go up and check the roofs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sentinels and Worgs keep the grounds of the Ice Fortress clear of Gumis, but I hear the vermin up on the roofs sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's so inquisitive, I don't think my sweet little [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF2_Kitten_A] would know what to do with a Gumi.... Or with a wild Tayga, if she ran into one of those mean brutes.</p>

          <p>I'm so worried about her. Purra is a sweet, helpless domesticated Tayga.</p>

          <p>She won't survive in the wild. She could die if we don't find her soon.</p>
