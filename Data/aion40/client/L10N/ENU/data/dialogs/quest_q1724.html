          <p>He needs to know how to deal with them. Unfortunately, we have little knowledge about them here, but I know an expert we can consult. I'm sending you to her.</p>

          <p>Memory Reapers? Oh, dear. I haven't studied them yet--I was distracted by some artifacts. Hmm. It must be important. What to do.... Ah! Yes!</p>

          <p>I met a man on Siel's Right Wing--Centurion, ah...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Laius], of the Gray Wind Legion. He's always in battle, going here and there in Reshanta. He'll have seen them.</p>
