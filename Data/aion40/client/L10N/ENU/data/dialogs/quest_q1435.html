          <p>Usually, trading with Shugos isn't a big deal. But they've collected all the accessible ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then they doubled the price of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_metal_n_c_20a]! I'm going to go broke.</p>

          <p>If they hadn't already mined all the easily accessible ore, I'd gather it myself. But my time is valuable, too.</p>

          <p>I know there's still Titanium Ore near the Manduri Village and the Manduri Stores. But they defend their territory fiercely, and I can't make weapons while I'm battling Manduri to gather ore.</p>

          <p>Daeva, are you going to be fighting the Manduri? Do you think you could bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_metal_n_c_20a]?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this. This is the same as I usually pay the Shugos. For what you gave me, it's a fair exchange.</p>

          <p>And I can make even more weapons. It's good to know that one thing won't be scarce in Eltnen.</p>
