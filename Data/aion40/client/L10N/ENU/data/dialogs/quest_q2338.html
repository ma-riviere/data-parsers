          <p>Until you get the hang of it, removing a manastone is a tricky business. But it's like anything else: practice enough and it becomes second nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I figured out at an early age that I wasn't meant for hard labor or dangerous work, so being a manastone remover is the perfect profession for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every once in a while, though, I feel like I'm not contributing enough to the glory of Asmodae. You ever feel that way?</p>

          <p>My fellow manastone removers are trying to synthesize more powerful manastones. I suppose that's the sort of thing I should get involved with if I want to contribute, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need as many HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones as we can get. Bring me all three types, and I'll give you another manastone as a reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm just the collector--I don't know how the synthesis process works. But it seems like a win-win situation, right?</p>

          <p>You remember which three kinds we need, right? The HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones are useful to us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd think one manastone is as good as another, but they tell me the slightest differences matter. "But they're all the same when I pry 'em out of the socket," I reply.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They haven't explained that part very well, have they? Maybe that's why I'm a manastone remover, not a manastone maker.</p>

          <p>I should probably learn more about this whole "manastone synthesis" project my colleagues are working on, huh? I never was much of a student, though. </p>

 			<p>These...these don't look quite right, I'm afraid. </p>

 			<p>The list says, "HP +40, Accuracy +16, Block +16." Pretty clear implication that we need all three to continue.</p>
