          <p>Greetings, [%userclass]! I'm sure you've heard of the famed Deathchant Legion. You know why we're called that, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...Frankly, I'm not sure myself. I think we're named for the dirges our enemies sing when they bury the comrades we slay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, as fearsome as we are, we welcome the aid of able Daevas like yourself.</p>
