          <p>I beg your pardon, [%userclass], but do you have a moment?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know of the Elemental Stone of Resurrection? I'd think a Daeva of your stature must have used one by now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a magical item created by imbuing an elemental stone with the power of life. Even untrained, you can raise a fallen Daeva without an Obelisk.</p>

          <p>At great cost to ourselves, we make these Elemental Stones of Resurrection available but all too few Daevas make use of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the will of Lady Yustiel, we're encouraging their use and educating the residents of Sanctum about these literally-lifesaving devices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're even rewarding those who use the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_SOULSTONE_RESURRECT]. Would you be interested, [%userclass]?</p>

          <p>An [%dic:STR_DIC_I_SOULSTONE_RESURRECT] is remarkably useful in the midst of a pitched battle against your foes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During challenging incursions, should a calamity occur, you can use them to raise your Cleric or Chanter. That can speed your recovery nicely.</p>
