          <p>You must be training very hard.</p>

          <p>Divine Power skills are special abilities that Aion has granted to Daevas like yourself. But because they're rarely used, even some veterans are rather inexperienced with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Divine Power Test is an incentive proposed by the Governor to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call it a test, but it's really more of a training session. It ends when you use a chosen skill ten times. What do you think? Would you like to give it a go?</p>

          <p>Very good. Let me see...you're an Assassin, which means you must have learned the Wind Walk skill recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DP_As] skill will be the subject of your Divine Power Test, so return to me once you've used it ten times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your Divine Power accumulates naturally as you keep fighting. Good luck!</p>

          <p>How surprising. I thought you would agree.</p>

          <p>Those who pass the test are also issued armor made specifically for Assassins, so come back when you change your mind.</p>

          <p>Hmmm...the flow of your Divine Power is smooth and uninterrupted. It seems you've practiced the Divine Power skill properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well done--you've passed the test. But keep honing your skills. The Abyss is full of Elyos and Balaur that need...well, I'm sure you know what to do with them, eh?</p>

          <p>Here's a reward we give to those who pass the test. This should be of use to you as an Assassin.</p>
