          <p>We've finally stumbled across the source of our Frillneck problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We sent [%dic:STR_DIC_LA09] to check it out, and he says it's Trandila that's to blame. Not exactly good news.</p>

          <p>You see, wherever you have an Aether imbalance, like they do in the southern part of the forest, you're going to have problems. In this case, the problem is mutated animals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A monster the locals call [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA17_5] is laying mutated eggs by the thousands. The village is cut off from everywhere else by all her offspring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I was thinking...if you can find this thing and kill it, you can get to the root, so to speak, of the problem. And hurry, would you? Trandila's probably laid a thousand eggs while we've been talking about it.</p>

          <p>Thank Ariel! If that monster had lived, there'd be more Frillnecks than trees in that forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks, [%username]. I'll send out some people to destroy any leftover eggs. The village is in your debt.</p>
