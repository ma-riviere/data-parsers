          <p>You killed Scopind? You'll have to bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3055a] as proof.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure you're trustworthy. It's just that I've dealt with bounty hunters and Shugos for too long.</p>

          <p>Thanks for bringing Scopind's Tattoo Tool Chest. You certainly had to kill him for it. I know he'd never have given that up while he was alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oileus will be jealous. That's less work for these other bounty hunters. Oh, that reminds me, I should have Rosina update her records.</p>
