          <p>Kysis Fortress. Just one look at it tells you of its strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ellies fought for nearly a week to take it from us, and we made sure they bled deeply for it all the while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll be twice as hard for us to take it back.</p>

          <p>Strength alone does not guarantee victory. We haven't the manpower to do what they did, to support a sustained frontal assault.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we have the cunning to go with another plan. We will strike them in many places at once, with small, fast squads.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We already have a squad to deal with the Balaur garrison, and now we are looking for volunteers to handle the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2813_all].</p>

          <p>Yes. Your strength will serve Asmodae well.</p>

          <p>Go to Kysis Fortress. Wait for a signal indicating that the fortress is vulnerable.</p>
