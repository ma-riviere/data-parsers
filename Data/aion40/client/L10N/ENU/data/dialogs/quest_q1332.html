			<p>The number and type of the coins you have determines which rewards you can receive. Silver Coins will get you better rewards than Bronze Coins, and more coins will get you a more valuable item.</p>

			<p>Tell me how many and what kind of coins you would like to give me, and I'll choose an appropriate reward for you from the list.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>The items I give are useful to those Daevas who use swords and bows: Gladiators, Templars, Rangers, and Assassins.</p>
