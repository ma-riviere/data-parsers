          <p>By order of Commander Votan, we are to attack the Dredgion as soon as possible. We must drive it away from Reshanta.</p>

          <p>[%username], during the attack I want you to focus on killing key figures inside the Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Others will focus on damaging various parts of the ship itself, but you need to focus on specific crew members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does this sound like a challenging mission?</p>

          <p>First of all, you must target its commanding officers and secondary officers. Bring back the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3714b]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3714a]s they carry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must also slay Auditor Nirshaka and Quartermaster Vujara. Bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3714c] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3714d] from their corpses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you manage to collect all these items, take them to Governor [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Votan]. He wishes to see how our efforts are faring, and what information can be gleaned from the evidence. Good luck, [%username]!</p>

          <p>I'm shocked. Are you saying this mission is beyond your capabilities? Surely not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I won't argue with you. I'll simply look for a Daeva who appreciates the importance of this mission, and isn't afraid of a little challenge....</p>

          <p>I heard that you were part of a recent attack on the Dredgion. Henir said you might have some items for me to look at.</p>

          <p>[%username], you are better than this. Perhaps you've had a bad day? Understandable, but you must try again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go, infiltrate the Dredgion and kill those you were sent to kill. Its commanding officers, secondary officers, Auditor Nirshaka, and Quartermaster Vujara are the figures I believe Henir mentioned.</p>
