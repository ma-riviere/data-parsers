          <p>The fortress is a little messy, isn't it? Don't worry, we're fixing it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Repairs were supposed to start as soon as we recaptured it, but all we've been able to accomplish so far is rebuilding the Aetheric Field and stationing guards.</p>

          <p>Those blasted Elyos! Three of them: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garpedo], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aimele], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sione] just won't give up! They've been attacking relentlessly since we reclaimed the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first I thought they'd give up when they ran out of supplies, but those balfired Shugo merchants, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_L5], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_L6] are helping them.</p>
