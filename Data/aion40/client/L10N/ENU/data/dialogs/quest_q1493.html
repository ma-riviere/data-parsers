          <p>Korumonerk's fortunes have changed so much since meeting [%username]. Such kindness Daeva has shown to a poor Shugo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But with [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_1493] missing, there is only shame for him, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Daeva has helped so much, possibly would do so again?</p>

          <p>Shoes, gloves, pauldrons. Not ordinary, not product of Shugo Craftsman for commission. Items are greatest treasures of Changanerk Traders, entrusted to Korumonerk as test of loyalty.</p>
