          <p>Many Daeva ask Taraerinerk to sell their stuff. Some are rare and precious, yes.... Others turn out to be stolen goods, nyerk, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in all Taraerinerk's years as a humble trader, the most expensive thing ever sold was a costume.... Yes!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cannot tell you the exact price! Even immortal Daevas can die of sticker shock, yes?</p>

          <p>Yes! Benes, Daeva of Divine Clothing, made the costume with her own hands without using any Tailoring skills. Truly handmade!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taraerinerk asked her why work so...unproductively! She said she puts entire thought into every stitch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Benes was making most elaborate costume for her lover...yes! But lover vanished in battle before costume was ready. Nyerk, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Benes asked Taraerinerk to sell costume...so much pain and sorrow, yes? So costume ended up here, not with costume merchant.</p>

          <p>Costume sales are hard! This one especially--too expensive! And not useful in battle...</p>

          <p>But yesterday, costume sells! Could Daeva tell this to Benes?</p>
