          <p>Though Isson has been sent back into the flow of Aether, I don't think his soul will rest easily. He must have been very angry to try and destroy the village he once worked hard to protect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Isson's real grudge was with me. We were so close once. But I was the one who locked him in the warehouse. No wonder he felt betrayed. I only wanted to protect him until the villagers could look past their grief. But he never knew that.</p>
