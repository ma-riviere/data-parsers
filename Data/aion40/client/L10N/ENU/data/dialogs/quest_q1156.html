          <p>The village is in trouble, Daeva. In times of conflict, symbols take on greater meaning. People cling to them.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, under the cover of night, the Kobolds stole inside the Nobelium and swiped the Village Seal!</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've made my feelings clear to Abolos. His response was, as ever, "No comment."</p>

          <p>The seal isn't just a token. It has practical uses. All our official documents are branded with its signet.</p>

          <p>What of Sanctum? Without official correspondence, we'll be cut off. They can't just trust any papers that come their way.</p>

          <p>I don't suppose you could return the seal for us? It would be a great help! I wouldn't ask otherwise, believe me.</p>

          <p>I'm certain it's somewhere in the Dukaki Mine. Kobolds have a tendency to stack all their loot in one place, so it shouldn't be too hard to find.</p>

          <p>Please, go to the Dukaki Mine and find the stack of stolen items. The Village Seal will be within it somewhere. You just have to look, not get caught, and bring it back.</p>
