          <p>Kahrun himself put me in charge of guarding the portal to Raksang.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Entering that place is no casual matter. Already much blood has been spilled there--more than you can imagine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you seek entrance, you had best be prepared. I cannot be responsible for what may happen.</p>
