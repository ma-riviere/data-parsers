          <p>Some Daevas think of Construction as a frivolous craft, but imagine a headquarters or battlefield without tables and chairs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not to mention the fact that there are so many other things that can be made besides mere furniture.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should try it for yourself. Open yourself up to its versatility and wonders. You will be amazed.</p>

          <p>We get Work Orders every day from every reach of Atreia, including the Abyss and Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From temporary shelters to the finest mansions, there are so many things that need doing, so much that needs crafting.</p>

          <p>Slow down! One thing at a time! Your intensity is admirable, but in this case, it's misplaced.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to learn Construction before you take on this project. That's simple logic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But please, keep up that enthusiasm. When you are properly trained, I want to see it in action.</p>
