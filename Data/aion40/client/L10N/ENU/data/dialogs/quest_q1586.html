          <p>Do you know Liske? She's based at Changarnerk's Campsite. She's been investigating the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every now and then, she drops by to survey Medeus Manor and all the activity there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last time she was here, she asked me to let her know anything new I find out about the local undead.</p>

          <p>If you follow the byway through Puitonen BogsÂ and Nolantis Ruins, you'll find Changarnerk's Campsite. Unless she's away on a survey, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lisidike] is usually there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole area's haunted. I know you've dealt with the undead before, but be careful.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, Daeva! We don't get many of your kind around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm impressed--between the ruins, the bog, and the undead, this isn't exactly the vacation spot of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What brings you to our Aion-forsaken little corner of Heiron?</p>

          <p>Now THAT'S interesting--undead mages doing magic.</p>

          <p>But why would they curse a place that's already ruined? Interesting indeed. I'm going to have to think about this.</p>
