          <p>Back before they exiled me from Pandaemonium, I was many things...public speaker, social critic...and Asmodian defender, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those who didn't know me from my speeches might have sampled my cuisine--a form of artistry all too rare among our people. Here in Ishalgen, raiders like yourself must scavenge for whatever scraps you can gather. But in Pandaemonium, the Daevas feast--feast!--on sumptuous meals and potent drink.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium, Pandaemonium...how grand your pretensions, and how feeble your reality.</p>

          <p>Bitter? Bitter! Does that make my words less true, Human?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium is full of graces and airs...murmurs and whispers...betrayal and lies. The Asmodian people shiver from the cold because they've lost the fire within. The older Daevas are the worst, for they've forgotten what they fight for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such weak thinking infuriated me. Eventually the fury of my words reached overly-sensitive ears. Rather than deal with my complaints--with my truth!--they dealt with me.</p>

          <p>Hard, yes. But not impossible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, let's deal with something you might understand--food! Despite my...circumstances...I still have a refined palate and rarefied appetites. Luring insects close to the crystal so I can catch them is tiresome, and the resulting meal is barely tolerable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd settle for simple Ishalgen fare--something like a crispy [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2123a], a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2123b], or a few [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2123c]. All local delicacies I haven't eaten since the rest of the prison was abandoned.</p>

          <p>Ah yes, the ginseng has such a strong smell...strong! </p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>You know the Daevas in Pandaemonium use ginseng to flavor their alcohol? And then they toss aside the root!</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>This is what I'm talking about--Pandaemonium and the rest of Asmodae are now worlds apart. Worlds apart! The thought of sending ginseng to the people of Ishalgen never even occurred to these "great and wondrous" beings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I prefer ginseng eaten raw...raw! The fresh flavor is a small joy in such bleak days. Oh! Here is the reward I promised.</p>

          <p>Ahh, Methu Egg!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A great many people think this egg tastes fishy--fishy!--when eaten raw. They go their entire life without trying it, but it's all a massive misconception spread through old folktales! Unless they're spoiled, the eggs taste fine!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see how easy it is to influence people by planting small notions here and there? Now imagine what other misconceptions exist in Asmodian society. Those other lies...those lies aren't as harmless as fishy-tasting eggs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll stop there. Thank you for bringing me this. Here, have your reward.</p>

          <p>Sparkie eggs! Pass them here...here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These aren't fresh at all. Sparkie eggs are supposed to be firm--firm!--and burst in your mouth when you bite into them. This one is too soft, and this other one is rotting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A shame...but I'll shamefully admit that my palate prefers rotting eggs to fresh insects. Take this as your reward, as I promised.</p>
