        <p>Ah-ha! Light bless us...I knew it was here somewhere. Apparently the palace was once open to everyone, but at some point it was sealed. Geting in won't be easy. </p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>The stories I've heard say the seal isn't an Aetheric Field. In fact, there's no Aether use to speak of. It's something they call "mirage magic." </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>There's a line about the Anair Lighthouse...something about light and mist being scattered by light from there? That doesn't make much sense. Hmm. I wonder....</p>

          <p>Let me see...here it is. This story came from a rogue Daeva who'd rather explore than take part in battle--a bizarre choice, but his information has its value. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said Alukina's Palace required a mirror to get inside. "You must pierce light with light," he said.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think just any mirror will work. The nature of the magical seal...yes. I see. Here, we need a special mirror to pass through the mirage magic with light and mist. The tool is to substitute the light from the Anair Lighthouse.</p>

          <p>First, a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1550a] from hunting Reinforced Kalgolems, then a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1550b] from Nolantis Gargoyles, and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1550c] from a Divine Sea Spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also some [%dic:STR_DIC_jr_part_d_mythril_02a] to maintain the magic. You can make it yourself if you have the skill, or have it made. It'll take four Mithril Ingots, so you'll want to get some Mithril Ore if you don't already have some.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you wrote that down. When you're done collecting materials, take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Diana]. She'll make the mirror for you.</p>

          <p>Erato knows of a story about Alukina's Palace. There is a ward on the place that uses some sort of mirage magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She gave you a list of special materials needed to create a magic mirror to bypass the ward. You collected a Blue Stone, a Rock Piece, a Glossy Crystal, and a Mithril Ornament and took them to Diana in the city of Sanctum. She asked you to wait while she made the mirror. </p>
