          <p>The situation here is worse than I thought. Marla Cave is a den of criminals and the entire area has been taken over by Calydons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should have done something before it got this bad. I've looked the other way for too long. It's time to correct that.</p>

          <p>I think the local bounty hunters can deal with the criminals in Marla Cave. A few wanted posters will do the trick. But I don't know what to do about the Calydons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My first inclination is to contract you to take care of it. Are you looking for something to do?</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. I'll trust you to take care of the Calydon Village.</p>

          <p>The incursions seem to be getting worse, so raid their base this time and show them a thing or two.</p>

          <p>Good to see you back safely. You're not the first one I've asked to deal with the Calydons, but none of the others returned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe they just gave up in the middle and went to somewhere else...yes, I'm sure that's it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed Calydons in the village and brought back their hair as evidence. She said she was glad you came back safely, and gave you a reward.</p>
