          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry, [%username]. You've caught me at a bad time. I just spoke to a Daeva who said Armorsmithing is an infinitely more important skill than creating cloth and leather armor. Can you believe it?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'd think one who has worked alongside Sorcerers, Spiritmasters, Rangers and Assassins would have developed understanding and appreciation. He is an ignorant fool.</p>

          <p>I don't know. Perhaps he's trying to hurt me. I was once a Centurion, but when the chance came to leave the front lines, I jumped at it. Some people held that against me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took me years to perfect my skills, but eventually my former friends returned for the armor and clothing I make.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, Humans have limited time--they never truly get a chance to perfect their work. But my abilities with both leather and cloth reflect the time offered a Daeva.</p>

          <p>Ah, then you have much to learn!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd be happy to train you in the art of Tailoring. The profession is not an easy one, but with hard work you could master the creation of cloth and leather armor.</p>

          <p>Good! I'm thrilled to see not all Daevas are so small minded. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first job will be to treat leather hides so they can be used to create armor. This is a simple yet fundamental skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Head out to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09] and kill Slinks and Worgs until you've collected at least six skins. I'll only need three leather strips from you, but you may ruin some as you work them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you've got the skins, come back here and use the looms to turn them into leather strips! Good luck!</p>

          <p>No, this is wrong. You haven't done as I asked, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, killing the animal does not guarantee a good hide. Some will have been damaged in combat, while others won't be of a high enough quality to warrant skinning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you have the skins, you also have to treat them on the looms. You may accidentally ruin some skins until you get the hang of it.</p>

          <p>Some Daevas regard cloth and leather Armorsmithing as unimportant compared to metalworking. Daphnis, a clothier, took offense to this and argued that those who can only wear cloth and leather armor require equally well-made protection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She urged you to obtain raw leather and treat it to see for yourself how much technical knowledge is involved. You hunted Slinks and Worgs to obtain the raw hides, then used a loom to make thin leather from them.</p>
