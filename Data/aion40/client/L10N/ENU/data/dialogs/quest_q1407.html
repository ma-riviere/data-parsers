          <p>Even though the Tigrics aren't completely wiped out, I'm very relieved that you thinned their ranks around the Observatory. </p>

          <p>I hoped that eliminating most of the Tigrics would encourage the locals to get back to their regular routines--farming, trading, and such. I need them to be out and visible to discourage the Krall from moving their forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it seems the Tigric boss is still around. Since you wiped out so many Tigrics, he's been hunting for you and he's terrorizing the locals. They're calling it "Akeras Stripeback."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People are shutting themselves inside their homes. So, I was thinking....</p>
