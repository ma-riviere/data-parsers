          <p>You have won the confidence of many other Daevas, and I know that I can entrust this mission to you without reserve.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a challenging mission, but an important one. And it is the will of Lady Ariel. Will you bear the responsibility?</p>

          <p>Soon the combined forces of Gray Wind and Nezekan's Shield will make an all-out assault on the Fortresses at the Base of Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in preparation, we must weaken their defenses. Your mission is to remove [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1736]s guarding the fortresses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They will be difficult opponents, so you must gather several groups into a Force. I trust your leadership will be admirable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, one more thing: gate guards appear only when the fortress is in a vulnerable state.</p>
