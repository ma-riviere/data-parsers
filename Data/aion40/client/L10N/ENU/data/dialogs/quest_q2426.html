          <p>I can't stop thinking about my laboratory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had decades of research and the rarest of supplies and materials there. All abandoned.</p>

          <p>Not to mention all my personal things, of course.</p>

          <p>I have to find a way to go back. This cabin will do for living, but it will never serve for research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to rid the place of spirits. But I haven't swung a sword in decades and my combat skills were never very good.</p>
