          <p>A piece of cake, of course! But this isn't just any cake; it's one baked specifically to celebrate Daeva's Day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between you and me, I snuck myself a sliver. I still can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I'll ever have anything that tops that flavor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can redeem that for you right now. Again, congratulations, and enjoy both the cake and Daeva's Day!</p>

          <p>On that assumption, you showed it to Belenus. She congratulated you and gave you a delicious piece of cake.</p>
