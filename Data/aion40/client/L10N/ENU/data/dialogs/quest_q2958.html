          <p>Selesti's never trusted me with the whole banquet before. To tell you the truth, I was sure I'd forget something important or make some terrible mistake, but so far, so good.</p>

          <p>I don't think I've missed anything, but I really want this to go well, for Karollin's sake. I should probably ask Selesti to look everything over. She might spot something I've missed.</p>

          <p>Thanks. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Selesti] has a huge pile of work to do, I know that.</p>

          <p>But she cares about Karollin. She wants this banquet to be a success just as much as I do.</p>

          <p>I suppose since Dorein's asked for my official once-over, I ought to go and give it. There's only one last thing to take care of, and I think the honor should go to you.</p>
