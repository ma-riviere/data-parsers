          <p>Azphelumbra...hot enough here for you?</p>

          <p>This heat is brutal, so I'll get straight to the point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Heat is the point, actually. Krotan Rock--and the whole island cluster--floats on a sea of lava. </p>

          <p>No, we can't stop the heat. We just suffer, and hope it makes us stronger in the end. The men's faltering stamina is one thing, but a bigger problem is the warping of weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This balflamed heat--along with the raw energy of the Abyss--warps our weapons! Expose a blade to this air long enough, and it twists like dead grass. Useless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Took us months to find a solution. But it requires someone to go beyond the fortress walls...someone like you, [%username].</p>

          <p>I've come up with a field expedient: Hearts of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1221_Pretor_38_An]s. Melting their stony hearts, then oiling our weapons with the fluid, prevents them from warping even in white heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So get some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2822a] for us. Oh, don't ask how we figured out this little trick. Long story.</p>

          <p>These hearts amaze me every time. You'd think they'd be hot to touch, but they're cold as Altgard ice.</p>

          <p>Hildebrant showed you that the scorching heat and chaotic energy of Krotan Rock is warping her soldiers' weapons, leaving the fortress guards unarmed in the face of danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she's developed a countermeasure, the melted hearts of heat-tolerant Ravenous Pretors. When spread on the weapons, the fluid from the hearts keeps the weapons from warping. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you hunted the Pretors and returned to Hildebrant with their hearts. </p>
