          <p>The Manastone Removers Association will soon become a thriving enterprise, sure to change the way all of Asmodae does business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No more Pandaemonium pulling our strings, and no more military commands. We're unionized, and now we make the rules. It's the way of the future, [%username]. Imports, exports--it's all Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interested in a job? If you bring me 10 each of MP +50, Evasion +10, and Parry +18 manastones, I'll pay you with a pouch of secret new manastones.</p>

          <p>Good to hear, Daeva. Remember, I need MP +50, Evasion +10, and Parry +18 manastones...10 of each or don't even come back.</p>

          <p>If you do this job well, I'll talk to my local Union Manager and see about bringing you on.</p>
