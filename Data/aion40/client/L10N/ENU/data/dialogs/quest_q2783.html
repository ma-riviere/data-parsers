          <p>They sometimes call this island "the grave of claws" because of that massive, wrecked machine there. Nobody knows who built it or when, but it is certainly ancient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a legend that says it once walked these islands, smiting anything it came across. I thought it was a fallen statue, but I've had second thoughts now that I've studied the Petralith.</p>

          <p>Looking more closely, I found light-emitting cores set into its body parts, the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_GiganticCore_Q2783A], [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_GiganticCore_Q2783B], and [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_GiganticCore_Q2783C].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those cores are also emitting massive Aetheric pulses now. I doubt that was happening before. I guess the Petralith was dormant before, but it's reactivated now. Setting aside why it's started now, I'm sure we could study those cores and learn some very useful tricks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], would you collect them for me? </p>

          <p>He's not just the Airship Dock manager. He's also one of the foremost engineers of Aether-powered devices. In essence, all our airships move by Aether power, and he's spent his whole life learning them inside and out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am sure that he can figure out how these cores work and how to tap their abilities.</p>

          <p>Ah, these from the Petralith in Reshanta? Njord and Radgrid said they were sending me some powerful Aetheric gadgets that I could probably develop into weapons.</p>

          <p>Hm... Even at a glance, these are unusual. Okay. I'm not really the expert, but I'll do my best not to let them down.</p>
