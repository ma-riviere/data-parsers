          <p>I never suspected that the Suspicious Box  Nerison reported was linked to Asmodae. Good work, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can use the Research Center Journal to trace the history of the experiments. But it's written in code. That's a problem. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to find someone to break the code. I need the information in this book!</p>
