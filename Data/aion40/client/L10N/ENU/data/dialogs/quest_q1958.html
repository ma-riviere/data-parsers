          <p>Medea keeps writing to me, and it's breaking my heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's miserable in that undercover job in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know she volunteered for the mission, but I don't think she realized how difficult it would be.</p>

          <p>Well, she was too stubborn to listen when I tried to dissuade her from taking the job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...perhaps now she's had a taste of real hardship, she'll rethink her ways. Would you go to Asmodae and deliver a letter to Medea?</p>

          <p>Jinus was concerned for Medea, who is working undercover in Asmodae. He wrote her a letter urging her to come home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Medea sent you back to Jinus with a response that thanked him for his concern, but explained that she must continue her mission.</p>
