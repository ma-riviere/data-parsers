          <p>I'm looking for a capable [%userclass]. I've recently received a message that Gigrite needs help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She says that Malek Drakies, originally inhabiting Mahisha's Nest, have come over to the Black Plains. They haven't caused any real trouble yet, but as their numbers continue to rise, it gets more and more likely.</p>
