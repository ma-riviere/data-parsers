          <p>I knew the contamination influenced both the soil of Brusthonin and its creatures, but the situation here is worse than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, have you seen the Ksellids and Kalgolems wandering around The Coastal Pass and Adma Plains? These creatures are so different from the ones in other regions. They're awfully violent, and they could be a big problem to the mending this land.</p>

          <p>When it's time to repair the contamination, I'm afraid these creatures might try to damage the sensitive cultivators.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium can't send more troops just to deal with these issues. Asustri and I can't possibly kill them all one by one--not with our other duties. I have to rely on the kindness of Daevas to get this job done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe any Daevas all the way out here will be skilled. So it would be wise to ask for their help. So...will you help?</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_ShellizardStoneD_48_n]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_ShellizardDesertD_48_n]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_SouledStoneRockD_48_An]s around here and in the Adma Plains are very violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know whether it's due to the contamination or not, but all those creatures have stinky, sticky lumps on their bodies. Kill the Ksellids and Kalgolems, then take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4062a]s inside these lumps and bring them to me.</p>

          <p>It was before my time, but Brusthonin was the breadbasket of Atreia before the Cataclysm. Hard to believe isn't it? All we see now is the contaminated land and undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Previous restoration attempts were fruitless> I hope we can make it happen this time. That's why it's important to make sure we have every chance of success.</p>
