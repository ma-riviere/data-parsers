		<p>Well, a Fabled Weapon will cost you 2000 Platinum Coins, but it is well worth the cost.</p>

		<p>I'm sure you would. But I can only give you Fabled Armor once you hand over 1000 Platinum Coins.</p>

		<p>It is a large figure, for certain, but understand that this armor is more than simple material and stitching. It empowers all who wear it. Their chants and their blessings, along with their defenses, will be amplified greatly.</p>

		<p>Daevas like you are not careless, so I know you will look after it. Just remember that such a special weapon needs far more care than most. Its power comes from its poise, you see.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Congratulations on attaining the weapon, friend. It will become a symbol of your determination, a token showing others the blood you've bled, and the blood that you have let, for Asmodae.</p>

		<p>You don't have enough coins yet, my friend. Without the correct number of coins, I cannot give out the reward you want.</p>

		<p>Do more work for Brusthonin, and you will be rewarded. Patience is key though--you must learn to value the things you earn. Gifts are meaningless. Rewards are not.</p>
