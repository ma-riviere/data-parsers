          <p>Is there fire or ice in your veins? You'll need both to fulfill this promise--it's no small task you've agreed to. Daevas from all of Elysea come here to kill me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I've made a bit of a name for myself here. I am truly feared--the power of the Shedim Lords made flesh. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All who come against me fail. They fall in battle, then rise again in my service, removed from the cycle of resurrection to spend eternity in the cold embrace of undeath. </p>

          <p>Of course. They do not deserve to live, not after what they've done. There are some, though, who've drawn my particular attention.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3_UndeadSeekerA_45_An]s give me some concern. While I can and will kill them all, there is something about them that gives me pause. They do not attack me, but rather watch my movements, gathering information and biding their time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assumed it was cowardice staying their hand, but now it seems a precursor to something else. If you want to help me, get rid of them.</p>
