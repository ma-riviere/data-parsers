          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I was just going through some materials I received from Sirink for a special procedure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a Red Magic Crystal and a Stone of Clairvoyance, but I'm missing something.</p>

          <p>It's difficult to explain, but I could really use your help. There's no time to lose, and it's difficult to find someone suitable for a mission like this.</p>
          <p>  </p>
          <p>Could you go get me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1460a]s? They're the scales of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Driton_33_An]s in the Kyola Temple.</p>

          <p>Boreas became concerned after opening the box sent by Sirink, because one of the materials was missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you offered to obtain the material, he told you that the materials collected so far were for making the activation stone of a certain Artifact, and asked you to obtain the Shining Scales of Thorntail Skyrays found in the Kyola Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you returned to Eltnen to obtain the materials that Boreas spoke of and gave them to Sirink, she asked if you met Boreas, and taught you an enigmatic phrase, "Bianu Ajitaran".</p>
