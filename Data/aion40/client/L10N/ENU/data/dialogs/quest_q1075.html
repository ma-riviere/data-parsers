          <p>As are we all. So tell me, have you ever heard of the Tigraki Workshop?</p>

          <p>It's a Shugo studio known for making Balic weapons and armor.</p>

          <p>But apparently those aren't the only things they make. I've heard that they also make special wings.</p>

          <p>Wings that are quite superior to ordinary wings, or so the story goes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are Shugos from the Tigraki Workshop doing business in Sanctum, but I've not found out where their base is. Somewhere in Reshanta, but the location isn't marked on any map.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Word is that a Shugo named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_13] makes those special wings. See if you can find him.</p>
