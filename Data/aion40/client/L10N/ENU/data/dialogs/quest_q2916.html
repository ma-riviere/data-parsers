          <p>[%username], you heard about what happened in the Temple of Knowledge? Someone got in and scrambled all the books. Thousands of tomes out of place--nobody could find anything they wanted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wasn't just an act of vandalism, however, oh no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With everything in disorder...and I immediately noticed this important point...nobody would notice if something had been stolen, and several very specific books were definitely stolen.  And now another robbery has occurred here in the Temple of Artisans.</p>

          <p>Since both robberies involve very highly specialized knowledge of Aether, I'm working under that assumption. Our thief might want to use the information for himself, or to sell it to someone else. It doesn't matter which. If these secrets get into the wrong hands, all of Asmodae is in danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today, my focus is on the robbery here. But that means the investigation on the books...well I can't be in two places at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need someone who can do the job, before the trail grows cold.</p>

          <p>Exactly, [%username]. I hear you're smart and strong. I could definitely use someone like you.</p>

          <p>I have Doman watching for anyone suspicious trying to teleport from Pandaemonium. And the airship captains are on alert. But the dock is full of unsavory activity. Think you can check the docks and find out if anyone suspicious has tried anything...well, suspicious?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Begin by questioning witnesses. Check with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Zerpi] at the Airship Dock first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He works in the back alley. If anything suspicious was going on, chances are he'll have noticed it. He might be a bit tongue-tied at first, so feel free to threaten him.</p>

          <p>His hood was pulled over his face, and he kept glancing around like he thought he was being watched. I'd say that was pretty suspicious. Yeah, if I were you, I'd go and twist Annju's arm. If anyone knows anything, he does.</p>
