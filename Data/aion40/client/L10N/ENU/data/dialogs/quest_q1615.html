          <p>In fact, my former colleague, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Lethe], infiltrated into Beluslan in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's disguised herself as a Lepharist and watches the movements of the Lepharists in the Alquimia Stronghold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've worked with her for a long time. She's really talented. Maybe as good as I am. I like to work alone, but Lethe is an exception.</p>

          <p>I'm getting to that. Yesterday, I received a letter from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Lethe].</p>

          <p>It was about the Suspicious Box.</p>

          <p>It came to the Alquimia Stronghold and she can't get too near it.</p>

          <p>Not much. I need to contact Lethe for more details.</p>

          <p>I suspect there's a Remodeled Human Test Subject in the box. It's a chance for new information.</p>

          <p>I know going to Asmodae is dangerous, but will you go to Alquimia Stronghold and investigate the Suspicious Box? </p>

          <p>You'll come out either inside Alquimia Stronghold or the Chaos Brambles near the Stronghold. Figure out where you are, then look for [%dic:STR_DIC_N_NPC_Lethe].</p>

          <p>She'll be somewhere in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_G4]. When you meet, give her the password, "When a Gryphu flies, a Pluma's Feather falls out." Don't forget.</p>
