          <p>We're starting slowly, raising the air temperature using Magic Flame Wards. It takes a while, but it protects the buildings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's been some discussion about applying heat directly, but the risk is too great. Higher temperatures may damage the ruins, and even lead to structural collapse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something odd though--the Magic Flame Wards aren't as effective as we expected. At first I thought it was because it's so cold here. But...I think there's more to it.</p>

          <p>A Daeva of Flame posted here previously told me that the ghost of Priest Esekiel appeared at critical moments in the work and destroyed whatever Magic Flame Wards were being deployed. Now, we've seen her spirit here but...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm at a loss to explain why a priest who governed Kurngalfberg would interfere with the restoration of the city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've dealt with the ghosts of Kurngalfberg before. Would you take care of Esekiel's ghost for me?</p>

          <p>From what I hear, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UndeadDarkWiNamedDQ_38_An] has been using a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2563a] that shoots blasts of icy energy. It must be incredibly powerful to break a Magic Flame Ward.</p>

          <p>She must be stopped. Send her back to the flow of Aether, and bring me the Frozen Orb.</p>

          <p>Is this the orb? I've seen many treasures, but I've never seen anything like this before. How...odd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder where Esekiel got it--but then Kurngalfberg was known for advanced magical objects, so it would be no surprise if it was made here. I think it would be best to send this to Pandaemonium for study.</p>
