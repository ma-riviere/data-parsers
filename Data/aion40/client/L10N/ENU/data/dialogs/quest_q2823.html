          <p>Hey! Did Hildebrant over at Krotan Refuge send you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It doesn't matter, I suppose. We need your help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This crazy heat is warping our weapons even as they leave our scabbards!</p>

          <p>Kysis Isle is a furnace, and scorching heat can deform a weapon. But I think this is more than hot air...the Abyss changes everything it touches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm new here, so when our weapons started deforming before our very eyes, I sent runners to Hildebrant over at Krotan Refuge. My missive might have been a little on the, um, panicky side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she shared with me the technique they're using over on Krotan, something I'd like to try. Can you help?</p>

          <p>Hildebrant says melting the hearts of Ravenous Pretors yields a fluid that protects weapons from warping.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A melted weapon is useless, and a weaponless soldier is almost useless, so I'll try anything. Can you hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_Pretor_38_An]s and bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2823a]s to me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ten hearts will be enough for one batch of fluid.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You might scoff at the notion, but Hildebrant swears this technique works. And she ought to know! Krotan's almost as hot as it is here.</p>
