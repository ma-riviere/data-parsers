          <p>So...when I heard about this loopy Daeva stationed in Morheim, I thought this was it! It was the perfect opportunity to get her back!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eveti bet Spedor will stay under that waterfall for a hundred years, and I said he wouldn't last a week. So I can't leave until he comes out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've a plan to speed this along. He's been in there two days, so he's got to be hungry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about you help me make a soup? It has to smell so tempting he won't be able to resist!</p>

          <p>I thought about what ingredients we can find around here for making soup, and I think [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2307a] or [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2307b] would be quite nice. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2307c] or [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2307d] wouldn't be so bad either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can choose which ingredient we should use, [%username]. Put whichever one sounds the most delicious in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_DF2_FOBJ_Soup_Q2307] and it won't be long before Spedor comes bursting out from the waterfall, hahaha!</p>
