          <p>Ah, Daeva! I need someone to do me a favor! Nothing too troublesome, just a delivery to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA18_4] that I cannot spare time to do myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this vial. It's a potion I've collected for my friend Illos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A man named Lepios was bitten by an Arachna. He only survived because of this treatment. Now that Illos is working with the Arachnas, I want him to have this just in case.</p>

          <p>Yes, very. I had to travel to Sanctum and speak with the Daeva of Life to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you do this for me, [%userclass]? The vial just needs to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA160], a researcher at [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA15_1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The camp isn't far from here, and you will be doing us all a great favor. What do you say?</p>
