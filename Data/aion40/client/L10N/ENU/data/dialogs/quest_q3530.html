          <p>What do you think is the most important trait, when it comes to working in groups?</p>

          <p>I think it's trust. Unless you trust your friends and colleagues, you cannot possibly depend on each other.</p>

          <p>Do you know who Icaronix is? That betrayer will do anything--I mean anything--to pursue his own interests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lately he's become a larger threat to the Elyos. Frankly, I think we should just get rid of him and be done with it.</p>
