          <p>Not everybody's got a talent for Alchemy. Just yesterday, a Daeva was in here trying to craft an Truth Orb and failing miserably.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After about fifty tries where she couldn't even get it to come out round, she got angry and smashed up everything on the table.</p>

          <p>Oh, I was cleaning it up for hours. That's why I like good alchemists better than bad ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like you. That's why I like you. You've got what it takes to become an Expert in Alchemy.</p>

          <p>You can't be an Expert in everything, though. When you're done with your studies here, you can choose one other field. So do you want to go for it?</p>

          <p>To start with, let's see if you can do what that Daeva couldn't and make Honir's Noble Spellbook. It's harder than [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2980], but you've got the skills needed to make it.</p>
