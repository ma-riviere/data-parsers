          <p>I rely on my Centurions to know their troops. They must have good combat skills but they must also show excellent leadership and organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I have a problem with one of my Centurions and frankly Daeva, this problem is not one I want to deal with.</p>

          <p>I promoted Amundi, who has long served in the legion, to Centurion, but rather than promoting cooperation amongst the troops he has stirred unrest. I hear daily of his hostility and incompetence, and the blasted thing is, he's misplaced my sister's daughter!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I counted on his experience but this is...shatter it! I'd rather lose my wings than tell my sister that Gjalf is lost!</p>

          <p>You're not joking! Now Amundi is frightened out of his wits, so I have no choice but to deal with the troops myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm worried about Gjalf. I know she wouldn't dare desert her duties--shards! I practically raised the girl myself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you investigate Gjalf's whereabouts, [%username]? I hope she's not stranded in some Balaur lair or smashed flat by a ghastly golem. That blasted Amudi doesn't have the brains Aion gave a Kobold!</p>

          <p>To get out of Reshanta one must pass through the Primum Landing. If she had been through there, someone would have seen her. So Gjalf must still be in Reshanta.</p>

          <p>If she teleported [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mure] will know. Go now and ask him if he saw my Gjalf--only don't say she's my niece, please. I don't want everyone to know she's missing just yet--not until I've had a chance to talk to her mother.</p>

          <p>Jebal asked you to investigate and report to Amundi. You first met Mure, a layer teleporter, and asked him if he'd seen Gjalf.</p>

          <p>Mure said he sent Gjalf and Ganglot to the Grave of Steel. You traveled there and found Gjalf with Ganglot.</p>
