          <p>[%username]! You've got to try this! The old books were right! Kselliki meat does increase your energy and strength!</p>
          <p> </p>
         <p>Sure, it's a bit sharp, but nothing a little spice can't fix. Have a bit more. Can you feel that wholesome energy?</p>

          <p>I'm going to cook up a big pot of Kselliki stew for everyone. This'll help us kick some serious Asmodian...talons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's certainly not going to hurt my reputation any! Now, they'll have to admit that a good diet can make a difference.</p>

          <p>Just make sure to avoid the adult Kselliki. Turns out their meat is completely inedible.</p>
