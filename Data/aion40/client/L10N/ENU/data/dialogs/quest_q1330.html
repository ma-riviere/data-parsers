          <p>Do you hear that sound? It is the heartbeat of Sataloca.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His body vanished many years ago, but his heart remained behind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By some incredible power, he created the Acheron Drakes, and still, though long dead, his influence remains....</p>

          <p>Then they started to change. They grew larger and fiercer...and grow more so with each passing day.</p>

          <p>Disconcerting indeed, though they haven't yet encroached upon Sataloca's Tomb. We should take action while we still can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they were to invade at the same time as the Acheron Drakes, we'd have trouble sealing off Sataloca's Heart in time--it controls the drakes, you know. We must take action now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could clear some of them off, we could start getting things prepared here so we can be ready for an emergency seal. That way we're covering the problem from both ends.</p>
