          <p>Bad news from the patrols.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After you tore up the undead 'round [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2A_SZ_C] things were quiet, but they've come back. Laborers out there planting seedlings saw it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They saw somebody gathering body parts and raising new zombies, so they ran. Don't blame 'em!</p>

          <p>I thought the undead were leftovers from the Cataclysm, but it seems the farm manager's making them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Must've been doing it when he was alive, for cheap labor, and never stopped. Horrible!</p>
