          <p>You know that old saying "the surest path to hatred is love?" My mother used to say that to me all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We had a fairly dysfunctional family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I finally, truly understand what that saying means. I love Amma. I love her sharp claws, her soft mane, but she gets under my skin like nobody else can.</p>

          <p>If you'd ever seen her, you'd know. She's so beautiful...well, but that just means all the other men in Beluslan are always flirting with her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I tell her I can't stand to see her talk to other men, she slaps me and calls me jealous. Maybe I don't deserve her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told her I'd cook her dinner because she said she loves men who can cook, but I'm terrible at cooking! I don't even have the ingredients!</p>

          <p>I thought I'd cook something simple for her--roast [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2504a] with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2504] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2504wine].</p>

          <p>You can find the Crestliches around the fortress, but you'll need to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Daraia] in Pandaemonium to get the cheese and wine. I'll pay you back, I promise!</p>
