          <p>Oh [%username]! Thanks so much for helping me make that sleeping bag from Crausaur Leather and Brax Skin. It was so warm and cozy. I slept well for the first time in ages. Even on the hard floor inside the fortress, it was great.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then the other day this Shugo merchant had his eye on it, and...well I just so happened to....</p>

          <p>I did...I sold it to him. I kept telling him no, but he offered me so much Kinah! I just couldn't refuse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's fine though. I mean, I have lots of time to make a new sleeping bag. The problem is I don't have the materials. I never expected to make another one, so I didn't keep the spare materials from the first....</p>

          <p>Great! I'll need the same materials you got for me last time. Please hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BraxD_21_n] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_PhainiD_22_n]s around here and bring me their skins.</p>
