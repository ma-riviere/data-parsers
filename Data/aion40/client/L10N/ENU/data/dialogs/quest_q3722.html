          <p>General Yulia was very pleased by how you've handled things so far, [%username]. She urged me to ask for your help once more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I assume you're familiar with Drana, yes? Come in a little closer.... Sanctum has assembled a new device from some Drana they collected in Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They want you to test it out...see if it works.</p>

          <p>Shhhh! Yes, [%username], yes, it's a weapon. Very hush-hush.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's specifically geared to work on dredgions. They want you to test it out in the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They want to know if it has a permanent place on the battlefield or not. You up for the task?</p>

          <p>I knew you were the right Daeva for the mission!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3722a] and get it up to the Chantra Dredgion. Install it wherever it won't be noticed...maybe near some machinery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take some damn good notes up there, too! Sanctum is keeping a close eye on this one, so perform at your best, [%username].</p>
