           <p>They tried to steal my pumpkin hat...right off my head! My eyes had adjusted to the low light, so when they popped it off, I was blinded for a moment. But I still heard the nervous chatter, and could just about make out those scurrying tails.</p>

          <p>Well, the job's much the same as last time, actually. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_Shulackwizard_99_n]s are still based around the great [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09]. All you need to do is return there and remind them of the nature of consequence. They try and steal from me, they get a visit from [%username].</p>

         <p>Your time is precious, undoubtedly, but you should recognize the consequence of inaction, friend. The Harvest Revel runs on nothing but the good will of good people.</p>

         <p>Without the good will, this great tradition will be no more.</p>
