          <p>Hey, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you been gathering around this area? Found anything interesting? I'm just wondering because...I know some unusual history about this place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know how Daevas can tap the essence of things like minerals or plants, right? Well, there once was a Daeva who could reverse the process.</p>

          <p>He was the richest person in Theobomos and he was such a miser that he kept his assets deep underground. He drew a treasure map on a stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>But he feared someone would steal that, so he cut the stone plate into three pieces and infused their essences into gatherable items around here.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <p>But what was the point? He was killed by a Balaur during the Cataclysm. Lots of people have looked for his map, but no one has found it.</p>

          <p>Well, he was paranoid, and made hundreds of fake stone plates. The fake ones are all out there, too. But once you find the right treasure map, you hit the jackpot.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>So, do you want to work with me?</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just extract the vitality from the usual things in this area, and if you find a piece of the map, bring it to me. I'll see if it's real. If it is, we can split the treasure.</p>

          <p>Great! So, whenever you can, use Essencetapping on any [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_metal_20a_lf2a], [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_noblemetal_20a_lf2a], [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_jewelry_20a_lf2a]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_jewelry_20b_lf2a], [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_jewelry_20c_lf2a], and [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2a_gb_source_herb_20a_lf2a]es you find in Theobomos. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The genuine plate was divided into three parts, so you'll have to search all the gatherable items around here to collect them all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And when you find stone plates, bring them to me. Good luck.</p>
