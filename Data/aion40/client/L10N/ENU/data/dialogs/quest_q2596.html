          <p>The Watch can't protect the citizens because they lack the necessary weapons. I suppose you're geared to the hilt, but you're a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've asked around and heard of something called a Power Shard. It's used to improve weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Iâ€™ve heard that all of the famous Daevas in the Abyss use Power Shard.</p>

          <p>Look, we're starving refugees. We couldn't get out of sight of Beluslan if it took a Kinah to go around the world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Reyrinirerk said that we could make a Power Shard by ourselves if we had the materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So we need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2596a]s from the Spirits and Obscuras in Alukina's Palace. With those, we could make our own Power Shards.</p>
