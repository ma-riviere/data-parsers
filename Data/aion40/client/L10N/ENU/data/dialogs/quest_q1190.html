          <p>Not long ago, we noticed a band of lowlifes settled in an abandoned shipwreck up the coast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We wondered if they were sailors at first, but Notos and Zephyros learned that they're Lepharist Revolutionaries...the same group causing trouble back in town.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But why would they come here? There's nothing to loot, no settlers to recruit....</p>

          <p>Indeed. I know little about them, save that they spread lies about Sanctum and spit on the names of the Five Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They need to be taught a lesson for insulting our heritage! Sadly, none of us stationed here are free to do it. Guarding the Aetheric Field is our priority, no matter how much we ache to punish these Lepharist scum!</p>

          <p>Leave the Aetheric Field to us. Go and show that filth who they're dealing with. If you can, look for clues to what they're doing here!</p>

          <p>Just walk along the coastline until you see the shipwreck. The scruffy-looking people milling around it, trying really hard not to look suspicious? That's them!</p>

          <p>Me, I'd be  relieved if you scared 'em off, but that's unlikely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We watch over the Aetheric Field that keeps Elysea bound together! To have that gang so close, and no idea what they intend...it chills me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go and put the fear of the Seraphim in them, [%username], and bring me any evidence you find of what they're plotting. But don't take on too many at once. They're dirty fighters, so I hear.</p>
