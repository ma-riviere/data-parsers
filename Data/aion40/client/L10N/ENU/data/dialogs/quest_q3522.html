          <p>I stand my ground here for the protection of Jeiaparan Village...just in case they need me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just in case! Someday, I'll use my weapon again, not just rest my hand upon its grip. I pray to Ariel that I get sent to the Patema Ruins...even the Nolantis Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is adventure there, my friend. Undeads spreading disease, creatures desecrating sacred sites.... Adventure!</p>

          <p>Perhaps you can venture there for me? Live the life I wish I was living. I'm stuck here in this sleepy village for who knows how long, watching my whiskers turn gray.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you, Daeva, you should go and fight the good fight, then return and tell me all about it. Tell me of the blood you spill and the limbs you sever!</p>

          <p>Go then to the Patema Ruins and Nolantis Ruins! Start by returning our wandering ancestors to the flow of Aether from which they came.</p>
