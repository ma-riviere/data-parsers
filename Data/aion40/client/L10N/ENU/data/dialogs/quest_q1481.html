          <p>Thanks to you, I've made great progress. My study on Kerubian weapons was quite a success!</p>

          <p>I have moved on to the study of more primitive weapons, specifically, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1481a]s of the trolls.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should be able to get those easily.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Troll_35_An]s in the Geroch Caldera in Eltnen use stone hammers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is quite nearly the crudest weapon imaginable. Yet still, deadly effective. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Glorious. That's why I'm interested in studying it.</p>
