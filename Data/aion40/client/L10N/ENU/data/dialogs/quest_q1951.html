          <p>Your ability as a [%userclass] is obvious, but I suspect it's not your only gift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyone can be taught how to forge metals into rudimentary weapons, but it takes a special aptitude to enter the ranks of elite weaponsmiths. I believe the weapons born at your hand could be fit even for the Seraphim Lords themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To reach that point, you must study hard and provide assistance when it's required. Actually, if you have the time, there is a certain matter you may be able to help with right now.</p>

          <p>The situation in the Abyss has worsened.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to deliver this Titanium Greatsword to Lucius in the Abyss. I sent him a shipment just a few days ago, but they have already been sold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The temperature of war can be measured in the stockpiles of smiths and armorers, an empty-handed merchant signifying trouble on the horizon. It's imperative Lucius receives this swiftly. I can't entrust this to anyone else.</p>

          <p>You've made the right decision. Our Daevas must never find themselves short of steel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lucius] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_2] of the Reshanta Abyss. It's not the most dangerous region of the Abyss, but you'll still need to be watchful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, take this Titanium Greatsword to him immediately.</p>

          <p>Ah, so you've come from Anteros! I trust he's well. I know he feels the pressure of the current situation more than many Elyos in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>War puts a great strain on the businesses that support it. I've had cause for concern of late: My supply of Titanium Greatswords has been completely depleted. They're sold as soon as they arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for making the journey to bring me this package.</p>
