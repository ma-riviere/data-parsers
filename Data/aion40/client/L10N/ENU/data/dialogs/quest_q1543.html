          <p>Can you feel that? It's from the Laupedes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Normal insects poison you with bites and stings, but this one releases a gas that can spread over a wide area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course we Daevas are okay, but it's dangerous to Humans.</p>

          <p>It only takes a few Laupedes nearby to endanger the camp. We'd never be able to reduce the population enough. I wrote a letter to an expert in Sanctum and he offered a solution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He can make an antidote. Then it won't matter how many Laupedes are around, the Humans will be fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to make the antidote he needs a few Laupede Poison Sacs, and I can't spare anyone to go hunting for them.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you. It's good to know that there are still some Daevas who will lend a hand willingly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look for [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Centipede_37_An]s and collect a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1543a] from each one. We need enough antidote for everyone, so bring seven of them.</p>

          <p>I've seen some due south of here in Mud Valley.</p>

          <p>That poison is incredibly strong. I hope you were careful handling it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll pack these up and send them to Sanctum.</p>
