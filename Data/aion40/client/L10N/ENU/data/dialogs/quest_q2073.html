          <p>Can you feel it? Feel it spreading through the Legion?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fear...the most odious weakness of all. Fear has gained a toehold in our ranks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I command a Legion of immortals, yet they still know fear. Not fear of death, but of something they see as worse...</p>

          <p>They're starting to fear being captured. The prospect of eternal imprisonment can be fearsome to an immortal, of course, and we've suffered more than our share of captures recently. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But such fear is weakness! And the way to expunge it is to show our Legion that imprisonment is only a temporary condition.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In other words, you're going to engineer a prison break. Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lakadi] has the mission details.</p>

          <p>Centurion Lakadi told me you were coming. The rest of the rescue team is trying to infiltrate, but you might try the direct approach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are prisoners on the Isle of Disgrace, southeast of the Sulfur Archipelago. That part is straightforward.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I'm not sure who controls the Sulfur Fortress, so I don't know what we're facing. If the Elyos have the fortress, our comrades should be confined on the Isle of Disgrace--no problems. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if the Balaur have the fortress, they may have moved our comrades to make room for Elyos prisoners. We'd need to locate our Asmodian prisoners.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So it's a two-part mission: Check who occupies the fortress, then bust in and rescue [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_Dark_28_An]s. </p>
