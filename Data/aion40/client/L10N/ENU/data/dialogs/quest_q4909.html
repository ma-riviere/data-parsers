          <p>We craftsmen were very busy when the war in Reshanta began. Powerful weapons were needed to defeat our enemies. Many craftsmen and engineers took to the task, but I think the weapons made by our studio were the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the most talented one in the studio was my master, Agrif.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He worked harder than anyone else, tirelessly perfecting his technique until his weapons were flawless. Having lost his family on the battlefield, he was driven by unstoppable rage.</p>

          <p>Agrif created a weapon that could defeat any enemy. Every Asmodian warrior wanted that sword, but Agrif had infused the sword with such pain and hatred that anyone who wielded the sword was consumed by it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sword's wielder became a powerful warrior, but one bent on mindless slaughter. Ultimately it took an Empyrean Lord to shatter the sword to pieces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fragments of Agrif's Rage were sealed in hidden chambers of each fortress.</p>

          <p>The time has come to reclaim the sword. Paths to the secret chambers have been revealed, and it seems the Balaur are collecting the pieces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Evil Sword must not be reforged by the Balaur. We must recover the pieces and remake Agrif's Rage. I have discovered a way to remove the curse from it, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you go and collect the fragments, [%username]? You can find them in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Divine_SZ_All], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Eciel_SZ_All], and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Wciel_SZ_All].</p>

          <p>You must first gather the blade fragments in the fortresses on the upper layer of Reshanta. The upper section of the blade was shattered into three pieces, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_01], the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_02], and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_ab1_03].</p>

          <p>The fragments are in Sulfur Tree Nest, Right Wing Chamber, and Left Wing Chamber. </p>

          <p>The remade sword can be yours, [%username], but not for free. Bring 2.4 million Kinah on your return. Don't give me that look!</p>

          <p>Blade fragments that contain the power of Light, Darkness, and Abyss...wonderful! Wonderful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See how they fit so perfectly? There's hardly any damage on the broken edges. It looks wretched now compared to its true magnificence, but I should be able to do something about that.</p>

          <p>Usener said that the pieces of Agrif's Rage, a weapon shattered by an Empyrean Lord, are hidden in the fortresses of Reshanta, and asked you to obtain the three blade fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you found the blade fragments in the Sulfur Tree Nest, Right Wing Chamber and Left Wing Chamber, and returned them to her, as well as 2.4 million Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usener said she can reforge the blade of Agrif's Rage, but it will take a little time.</p>
