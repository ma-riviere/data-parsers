          <p>I'm supposed to be guarding the supply depot, but I find myself helping Fyra out. It's my duty to keep an eye out for attackers, not help Fyra with deliveries! But everyone is busy here, and we're short handed, so I help when I think it's safe. How can I say no?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't need to worry about invaders in the Primum Landing, right?</p>

          <p>Blast it, this new supply requisition is vexing. Most supplies requested from a bind point or a fortress, so I pack them and send them by messenger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this one is for supplies addressed to that bloodthirsty Mokkurkalfi.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know who Mokkurkalfi is, don't you? He was one of our most fearsome fighters, but he left the Red Hasia Legion--now he leads his own personal campaign against the enemy.</p>

          <p>I thought Mokkurkalfi worked alone, but I might be wrong. Maybe he's on a secret mission or something like that...? I don't know why else we'd be sending him supplies....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I can't send an official messenger for "unofficial" supplies, nor can I go there myself--I can't leave the supply depot unguarded.</p>
