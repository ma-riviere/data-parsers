          <p>Good to see you, [%username]. Feels like I see clients more now that the Manastone Removers Association formed its own union. A true testament to the brotherhood of the trade.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you know the process, so I'll just tell you what I'm looking for today: HP +30, Accuracy +14, and Block +14 manastones, in bundles of 10 each.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems these are in pretty high demand, for some reason. I have buyers lined up already. You find me those, Daeva, and I'll set you up with something you'll really like.</p>

        <body>
          <p>You're probably asking yourself why I sell my...overseas clients these old manastones then reward you with newer ones, right? Why don't I just sell them the new ones and cut out you, the middle man?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because even I have morals, [%username]. I'm not going to sell a possible enemy the same stuff our soldiers use. Plus...newer manastones are harder to smuggle over the Balaurean border. Bigger fine, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's neither here nor there, eh? So, it's HP +30, Accuracy +14, and Block +14 manastone bundles...10 apiece. Have 'em? Or know where to get 'em?</p>

          <p>Well, your loss. Lots of Kinah in this business...just need to turn over the right rocks to find your buyers.</p>

          <p>I'm supposed to be on my break right now, Daeva. The Manastone Removers Association union is very serious about its members taking all of their seven breaks each and every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You start bending the rules now, and every member will suffer because of it. But...we've done business before, so I suppose I can push my break back a few minutes for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you bring the manastones I asked you for? That's why you're here, right?</p>

          <p>And I suppose you're ready for your payment now, eh? I've got a source inside a Morheim military faction that slides me a few of these beauties once in a while.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>You've been a good supporter of the M.R.A., so I'm going to let you have a nice big pouch of these. Blood for blood, Daeva!</p>
