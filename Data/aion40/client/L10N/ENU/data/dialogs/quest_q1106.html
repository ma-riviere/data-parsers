         <p>Hey, [%username]! I have another favor to ask.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Those Snufflers and Kerubs nearly wiped out my entire crop. Things are under control now, but I'm worried that if I leave my plot, they'll do even more damage.</p>

          <p>I need someone to take what grain I could recover up to the village. I've already struck a deal with Uno, the village cook, so you needn't worry about selling the goods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's just up the road, and I'm sure you have other work that'll take you there anyway. I need to trade the grain for enough food to survive.</p>
