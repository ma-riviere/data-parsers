          <p>Well anyway, the cave. I've heard that the cave isn't filled with just lava and Klaws... but something...shiny.</p>

          <p>That's what I thought. You see I'm getting old and I'm not in any shape to chase after those stones. I cough a lot and I'm more tired than I should be. I should improve my diet to regain my health but I can't afford good food....</p>
