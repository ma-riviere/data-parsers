          <p>What have you got there, [%username]? A second-hand spellbook, is it? I don't think any of the militia can use...</p>

          <p>Wait. That's Krallic lettering. And that symbol on the cover...I've seen it before. That's their symbol for Odium!</p>

          <p>Looking at the pictures, it's definitely a treatise on Odium refining! </p>
