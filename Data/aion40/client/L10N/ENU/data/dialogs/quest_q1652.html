          <p>It seems the mighty power of Bollvig still lingers, even with the Cursed Obelisk destroyed. I thought the Daevas whose souls he ensnared would be free from the curse, but clearly I was wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sent a message to Sofne at the fortress asking for her advice on the matter.</p>

          <p>She replied that destroying the Cursed Obelisk alone wouldn't end the curse--we must also call upon the power of our own Obelisk.</p>

          <p>Until then, the Daevas whose souls it has ensnared will endure the torments of the undead.</p>
