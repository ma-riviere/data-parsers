          <p>Hmm...this is an interesting piece. No, it's not mine. Look at the size. It's too small for my hand.</p>

          <p>You recovered an odd dagger from a Burnt Zombie. You thought it might be a skinner's knife, so you took it to Melleas. He said it looked like a stonecutter's tool, so you took it to Josnack.</p>

          <p>When Josnack saw the dagger, she broke down with emotion and said that it belonged to her master Lasar, whom she hadn't seen in years.</p>
