          <p>Arieluma Daeva. I'm sure you agree with me that the most important piece of equipment a Daeva can carry is a shield. There's no better way to stave off an errant blow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I happen to have the ultimate in protection too: an Honorable Guardian Conqueror's shield! It's all yours if you have the requisite medals and Abyss Points.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. I oversee the distribution of shields to Daevas who have earned the right to carry an Honorable Guardian Conqueror's shield. It's a rare privilege conferred on our fiercest, most dedicated fighters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope that you will be one of them.</p>
