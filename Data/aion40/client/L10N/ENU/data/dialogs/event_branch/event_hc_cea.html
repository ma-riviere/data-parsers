          <p>Oh, there's [%username]! I know you'll help our cause. You wouldn't want to disappoint the poor orphan children, now, would you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good, good. I'm going to need plenty of those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_EASTER_01]s if we're going to have enough for all the children.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So what you're going to need is plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_01A], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_02A], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_03A], to paint the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_04A]s. That should cheer up our kids, now! I'll reward you, but I know you'd do it anyway. For the children..</p>
