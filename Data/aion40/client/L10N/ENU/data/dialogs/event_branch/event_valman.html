          <p>Ugh, how did I get roped into this? Fossil this, ancient that. It all looks like lumps of rock to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The more I collect, the sooner they can open their Natural History Museum and the sooner I get out of here. Worst part is, I got stuck collecting the animal fossils, which are the hardest to get, so I'll never get my quota. You have to kill dungeon bosses or something for it. No-one I know is strong en--heeeey, wait a minute! You're pretty powerful-looking. Why don't you help me out? If you hurry up, I'll give you something halfway decent in trade. At least someone's getting something out of this!</p>

          <p>You know what they're saying now? These fossils can predict shifts in the world's crust or some such. Did you ever hear of anything like that? Looks more useful for gritting the pathway, to me.</p>

          <p>Oh well, each to their own. Eggheads get fossils, you get trade, I get... I don't know what I get, but I know a headache's on the list.</p>
