          <p>Wait, Daeva has never heard of Reklov or BrewShugo? Speechless! Goal is to brew strongest beer in whole world. [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Octorung] says strongest beer won't win, but we'll show him. Just bring all the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_INGREDIENT] to me, and not those other inferior brewers, and shugo makes beer like world has never seen!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For each piece of barley, will give ticket. Once my beer is done, can trade tickets for amazing brew, or other stuff if taste buds can't handle best beer in world, I guess.</p>
