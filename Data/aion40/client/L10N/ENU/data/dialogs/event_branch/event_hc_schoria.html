          <p>Wait up, [%username]! I'm looking for patriotic Daevas to make contributions to the war effort, and I'm prepared to reward them generously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians expected us to make nice with the Elyos, but we'll show them. The problem is, we're having to ramp up our operations so much that our normal channels for providing rations are just not cutting it. That's why I'm collecting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_CCU_WORLD_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's pretty simple, [%username]. Just take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_WORLD_02A] you find in your cube and imbue it with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_WORLD_01A]. That makes a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_HCOIN202A_BOX_04], which you can unwrap to find the rations I'm looking for. If you have any now, I'll happily take them.</p>

          <p>Please, help! I need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_CCU_WORLD_01] for the war effort.</p>
