          <p>Happy Daeva's Day, [%username]! Three years eh? So much has happened in such a short time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's what the cake's about, you know! Three candles for three years of Aion. If you have an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_DEVASDAY_01], speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_EVENT_Happolia] here and you'll be able to exchange it for a powerful candle!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The candle goes in the cake, and, just like that, you'll be buffed up to the eyeballs! Each candle works differently though, so read the descriptions carefully.</p>
