          <p>Just brush this bit caaaaaaarefully away... Oh! Sorry, I didn't notice you there. These fossils truly are fascinating, aren't they? That's why we're opening a brand new museum--the Atreian Natural History Museum--and we need all the fossils we can find for our grand opening. Any type of plant fossil you get your hands on--you find it, we'll display it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're offering some good stuff in trade, too.</p>

          <p>These fossils are intriguing enough in their own right, but there's a school of thought that says we might be able to use them to predict future shifts in Atreia's crust by studying what happened in the past. That's really groundbreaking! Uh, no pun intended.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aside from that, they're just incredibly intricate and beautiful, don't you think? I could look at this shell one for hours.</p>
