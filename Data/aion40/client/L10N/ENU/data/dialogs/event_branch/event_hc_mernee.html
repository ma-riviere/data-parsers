          <p>You're a do-gooder, aren't you, [%username]? I mean, that's what I hear about you. Well, this is a chance either to keep do-gooding--uh, doing good--or to make up for your past misdeeds. Sounds great, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I need is for you to bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_EASTER_01]s. It's all for orphan children something or other. We're supposed to paint [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_04A]s with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_01A], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_02A], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ASSEMBLY_WORLD_EVENT_MATERIAL_EASTER_03A], but there's no hope of doing enough for all those kids.</p>

          <p>I'm authorized to give out rewards for each batch of eggs we get, in case that sways you at all.</p>
