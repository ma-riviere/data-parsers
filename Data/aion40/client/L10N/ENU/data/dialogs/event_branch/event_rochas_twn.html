          <p>Oooooh, [%username]! I didn't expect to see you signing up for this. I mean, we would totally love for you to help out with our fossil gathering, don't get me wrong... but only if it won't interfere with your other duties. I'm sure you have lots going on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well... if you're sure? My colleagues need all sorts of fossils, but I'm looking for the highly prized animal relics. You may have to take on a powerful dungeon boss or two, but I promise the Atreian Natural History Museum will make it worth your time.</p>

          <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your help! You're doing a really good thing for us all here--we're going to analyse these fossils and try to predict shifts in Atreia's crust in the future. So, you see, we can all benefit from this effort.</p>
