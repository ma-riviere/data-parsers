          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. Is that an Archon Commander's weapon I see at your side? Were you aware that if you have one of those weapons, some Honorable Mithril Medals, and some Abyss Points, you can trade them to me for a better weapon?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does that seem like something you'd be interested in?</p>
