          <p>Come on over, [%username]! We're celebrating Daeva's Day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those twiggies might not bother respecting the past, but Asmodians are better than that. The last three years have flown by, and we've seen a great many Daevas come and go. We're here to celebrate our successes and commemorate those who are no longer with us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, time to raise a glass and light a candle! If you have an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_DEVASDAY_01] on you, then speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_EVENT_Berdinea] and trade it in for one of three candles! Blood for blood!</p>
