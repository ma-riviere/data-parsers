          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. I suppose you're here to exchange Honorable Contribution Medals?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, of course you are. That's all anyone ever comes here for. Why they bother talking to me though I don't know. It's not as though I can do anything for them, or for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I might as well be a sentient traffic sign. "Go talk to a distributor of Honorable Equipment," my sign would say.</p>

          <p>Daeva, you're just here to ask me about my life? Not get directions to where you can go to trade your Honorable Contribution Medals?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I--I feel so honored. No one ever just wants to talk to me. Thank you.</p>
