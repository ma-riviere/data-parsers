          <p>The Pink Petals fluttering about are fascinating. At first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But very quickly, they get mashed underfoot and start to decay, creating a mess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I collect them to prevent that. It's a bitter reality, but there's no other way.</p>
