          <p>I'm so worried about my husband.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's all alone, in Sanctum, and in his last letter he said that he wasn't feeling well. Then...nothing. No more mail.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I shouldn't worry, but it's been two whole days!</p>

          <p>Yes! Two days! I write to him every morning, and every evening...and he always, well usually...mostly, writes back!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should be there, looking after him. I knew it was a bad idea for him to accept that post in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>That's nice of you to say, but I'm still so worried! I'd better send him a cold remedy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes. That will help. I'll send him medicine. I know this great recipe I learned from an apothecary in Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you help me collect the ingredients? I need to make it quickly...I just know he needs it!</p>

          <p>The main ingredient is Monitor's Tails. It's great stuff, not just for colds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's also good for weakness, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, hair loss, and all sorts of other things. I'm sure it'll help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3537A]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Varanus_33_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3537B]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Varanus_34_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It should be easy to get those. The Monitors all congregate in the Gloomy Mire down from the Aetheric Field Observatory.</p>
