          <p>When I was recruited as a spy, I jumped at the chance. I'd always had these dreams of being a dashing rogue sneaking into Elyos strongholds in disguise and performing daring feats of espionage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now look at me. Some glamor, eh? Even those clawless Lepharists sleep in a warm building. I get this thrice-blasted tent with more holes in it than an Elyos hugging a Mookie!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With all the snow and wind, it's a wonder I'm not an icicle. But complaining isn't the Asmodian way. I'm doing something about it here and now.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, my grandmother passed on a bit of her Tailoring skill to me. If I had some animal skins--and I think I'll need a lot--I could make this tent halfway livable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are a lot of Gorgons in the Chaos Brambles. Their hide is thick and their fur warm, so they'd be ideal. But they won't give up that hide and fur easily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So how about it, [%username]? Willing to do some hunting for your old pal Dewi?</p>

          <p>Hey, compared to fighting Lepharists, hunting a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonWhiteBabyD_42_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GorgonWhiteD_43_n]s should be a piece of cake, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd go out there myself, but then I'd be too exhausted from the hunt to do any Tailoring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How many skins? Let's see, with that many holes...about that big.... Fifteen will probably cover them all. Hey, my freezing toes and fingers thank you.</p>

          <p>So you get to leave this miserable place, and I have to sleep here another night in the freezing cold? What kind of justice is that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yeah, it may be my destiny, but that doesn't mean I have to kiss it on the cheek and cuddle it like my firstborn son.</p>

          <p>I'm going to need at least 15 skins if this tent is going to be less than freezing.</p>

          <p>Okay, okay, I know you're doing me a favor.... Fine. I just need more skins from Crystalhorn Gorgons and Baby Crystalhorn Gorgons. So do you mind going back out there?</p>
