          <p>Eager, eh? Good. Your mission comes directly from Sanctum. You'll be learning what makes a Daeva. I don't know what you expected when you came here, but be prepared for anything. Don't wander around unarmed and don't shirk your responsibilities. You must give everything you have in service to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are several people that you will be required to meet. Speak to them and listen carefully--one never knows when the smallest bit of information may prove essential.</p>
