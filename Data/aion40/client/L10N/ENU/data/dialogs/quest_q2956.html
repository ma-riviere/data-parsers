          <p>Humans think love is forever, but it isn't. Even the love between parents and children can wither away as the decades turn into centuries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are always exceptions, though. Karollin's love for her son is one of them. Her steadfast loyalty, her hope...it puts my cynicism to shame. Almost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's worthy of a first-class banquet, at any rate.</p>

          <p>The venue's taken care of, so there's just the food to worry over. Since we're going for cozy, I'm inclined to use home-style cooking instead of anything trendy or fancy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think we should find the kind of things Aremion enjoyed when he was young.</p>

          <p>Soft Potcrab Salad and Slink Meat Pie. Karollin says those were his favorites. I wonder where she used to get the ingredients? Easy enough in Altgard or Morheim, but nobody stocks that stuff here in Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's next to impossible to procure fresh [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2956a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2956b] around here. I might need your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>Excellent. The flesh of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_PotcrabD_18_n]s near the Black Claw Village in Altgard is the softest in all of Atreia, and the best Slink Meat comes from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_lepismaD_19_n]s that live in the frozen lake near the Morheim Ice Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm also going to need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2956c] for seasoning. Could you be a dear and pick some up from a food merchant? Thanks!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Oh? Really? Wasn't it you who brought this request to me in the first place? I thought you were as moved as I am by Karollin's love for her son.</p>

          <p>Selesti decided on Potcrab Salad and Slink Meat Pie as main dishes, since Karollin used to make them for Aremion. She said that she'd need the best quality ingredients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You obtained Potcrab Meat by hunting Dune Potcrabs in Altgard and Slink Meat by hunting Ice Slinks in Morheim. Then, you procured some Raydam vinegar and brought all of the ingredients to Selesti.</p>
