          <p>Well, I ask because [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo3] of the Wind Breeze Shop has been asking me to find someone who's on their way to the Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He only wants to send a letter. If you've got the time and are headed that way, you should speak to him before you leave.</p>

          <p>Even better...Numonerk's coming after his money.</p>

          <p>I would have paid him long ago, but that little miser hiked up his prices. He procured a fine weapon, but it's not worth half what he's asking.</p>
