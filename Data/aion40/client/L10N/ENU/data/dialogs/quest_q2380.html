          <p> </p>
          <p>I have been made aware of a more serious problem than the guards you eliminated. </p>

          <p>In the shadows near every Mist Mane leader is an escort of Elite Bodyguards. </p>

          <p>These are the real reason why the assassination plan failed. These local fools neglected to mention this in their reports.</p>

          <p>So now, you and I have wasted time. I do not apologize, but the task remains undone. Will you eliminate this last obstacle?</p>
