          <p>Hi there [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say, do you know how to mine [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_10a]? I have a rather pressing need for a small amount of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's too expensive to buy, and I can't mine it myself anymore because of all the Krall....</p>

          <p>There's a mercenary scout, a young man named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Poa]. He's currently stationed just east of the abandoned Timolia Mine. </p>         
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard he used to be an excellent craftsman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He still makes certain items for people, so I hear, and his music boxes are exquisite.</p>

          <p>Well, I asked Poa to make me one of his music boxes, and he said he could, but first he needed a sufficient quantity of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_10a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only way to get the ore is to dig some out of either the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA08] or the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07] while avoiding the Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you think you might be able to gather some ore for me, and take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Poa]?</p>

          <p>Thank you! I was hoping to give the music box to someone very special. That's why I need the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_10a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, you can find the ore in either the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA08] or the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07]. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Poa] said he'd need three chunks to make a music box.</p>
          <p> </p>
