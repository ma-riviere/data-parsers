          <p>When I first learned Besfer Ghost Village was full of undead, I petitioned Pandaemonium for help. In my experience, the undead are best handled by a specialist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gigrite], a Protector of Divinity, was dispatched here. She is the best in all Atreia when it comes to purifying the undead.</p>

          <p>For this situation, it is the BEST talent to have. I think she underestimated the number of undead, though, as she only brought a couple Archons and a priest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know that won't be nearly enough. Would you deliver this letter for me? It's just a reminder that she can ask for reinforcements whenever she likes.</p>

          <p>Nerita said that Gigrite, a Protector of Divinity, was dispatched according to her request, but that she would need more support than she brought with her. She asked you to deliver a letter stating that she would provide whatever Gigrite needed.</p>

          <p>When you delivered the letter, Gigrite was grateful because she did need reinforcement.</p>
