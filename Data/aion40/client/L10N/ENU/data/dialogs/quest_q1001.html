          <p>I heard about your little nap. Not the most auspicious start to your new career, but perhaps we weren't working you hard enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, that's about to change: I've got a new job for you.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You know Ager? He has a small farm near [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA03]. Anyway, he's in a bit of trouble. You see, [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA116]s have completely overrun his farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ager and his farmhands have fled, and now, his crops are in danger of spoiling before they can be harvested. That means people will go hungry, and more importantly, Ager won't be able to pay his grain tax to the [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA15].</p>

          <p>Good. Well, a couple of days ago, the villagers all got together and tried to take back the farm. Needless to say, it didn't go well, and now, there are even more Kerub than before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's no surprise really. These locals make fine farmers, but they didn't stand a chance against those things. Anyway, this is where you come in. The village priest has asked for our assistance, and since this whole situation affects the Nobelium, the Captain has agreed to help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need you to find those Kerubs and teach them a lesson they won't soon forget. Time is of the essence, [%username]--get going!</p>

          <p>I've got to say, [%username], you surprise me. It's a real shame you've lost your memory. I'd love to know what you were up to before you smacked your head. I'll have to find you some more challenging tasks before you get bored of this mercenary work.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Well, you did quite a job on the Kerubs, but as you've seen, we've hardly dented their numbers. We need a new plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been studying their social structure, and it seems these creatures follow a strict hierarchy. We think that taking out the strongest of the Kerubs will cause the rest to scatter, thereby saving us considerable time and effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to run a field test. I want you to kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA117]s and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA67]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and one last thing: the Bigfoot Kerubars look similar to the Smallhorn Kerubs, but are far, far more violent. Watch yourself out there.</p>

          <p>After that first job, I could see you had potential, but I expected this one to be more of a challenge. Clearly, your memory loss has not affected your combat abilities.</p>
