          <p>I'm very concerned, [%username]. Beluslan isn't the only place the Balaur have invaded. I've heard that they've also infiltrated Elysea, in Heiron specifically. </p> 
          <p> </p> 
          <p>It seems they've opened an Abyssal Gate that links their Indratu fortress with Elysea. Our observatory is already destroyed...if the Balaur manage to open the gate there, they could open it here too. Our people will be in grave danger.</p>

          <p>We must send someone to Indratu Fortress to investigate. The journey will be difficult, however. The Abyssal Gate leading to Heiron was made by the Balaur. If a Daeva uses it, it will cause intolerable levels of pain. </p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>There is a way around it, thankfully. The Balaur use magic to offset the pain. If you kill an Indratu Worldbender and obtain a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2673a] along with a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2673b] from an Indratu Protector, I can extract the energy from the items and imbue it into your armor instead.</p> 
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Would you undertake this quest, [%username]? We need someone of your caliber to make this mission successful.</p>

          <p>Go to the Nute Warrens in Elysea. The rift in the Bakarma Barracks will take you directly there. The Balaur who guards the place is an [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3E3_EeA_NagaEleD_47_Ae]. Defeat him and take his Bead of Magical Power.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>If you then kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3E3_FeA_NagaFiD_47_Ae], you'll be able to gather a Fighter's Skin as well. I wish I could claim this would be easy, but it won't be. Choose your companions with care, and come back safely.</p>

          <p>I'm afraid to ask how your journey went, [%username]. So much rests on our actions here. I lost the battle to save the Observatory...I don't like to think what might happen if we lose this one too. We must wipe out the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Gwendolin was worried that that the Balaur would open the Abyss Gate in Asmodae like the one they opened in Elysea. She sent you to investigate the Indratu Fortress and find a way to stop them.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to accomplish this, you needed to instill Balaur energy into your armor so that you could survive using a Balaur Abyss Gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Elysea through the rift, got a Bead of Magical Power and Fighter's Skin and brought them to Gwendolin. She imbued your armor with Balaur energy and sent you on to infiltrate the Indratu Fortress. </p>
