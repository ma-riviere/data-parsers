          <p>Oh it's you, [%username]. Good to see you again! You'll be pleased to know that, thanks to you, I completed that robe for Pernos. However, there's... a bit of a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had to measure Pernos for the robe, but on my arrival, he said that I should leave him alone and just guess at the measurements! He treated me, ME, like an amateur! So, I took matters in hand and took his measurements by force!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The very next day, Pernos came to town. I was fetching the finished robe when our priest came over to greet him, and he treated Pernos like some highborn lord of [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Clearly Pernos is a man of status, and I'd gone and treated him like an insolent child! Merchants have been ruined by less! Ruined!</p>

          <p>Well, I'm too embarrassed to show my face, but someone has to deliver [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12] his robe. I should add an ornament to it too, so Pernos sees I put my very best efforts into it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA14], an [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA15], or a [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA16] are all suitable for these colors. Will you find one of them, and take it to him, [%username]? Please?</p>

          <p>Oh! Thank you! You've lifted the weight of the heavens from my shoulders! You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12]'s home on the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA06]. Oh, and remember the ornament! A [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA14], an [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA15], or a [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA16], any of those would be fine!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA11] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA05_2]. And there are plenty of Brax near [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA03] and Abex in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA04]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best of luck! And thanks again!</p>

          <p>Mune may have mentioned that the robe allows me to discern Aetheric patterns. It will enable me to root out Asmodian spies and identify Humans who have the potential to ascend as Daevas. It's a subtle, powerful tool.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva sees patterns underlying everything. When I put on this robe, I can glimpse the world of the ascended few! Ah, there... it fits rather nicely, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Yes! Ribbons of silver drifting off the Moonflower Blossom, and... my! Your aura! A Daeva's is dull beside it! Tell me--did you choose the ornament on my robe?</p>

          <p>Interesting!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You could not have known, but a [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA14] makes an excellent Aetheric focus. Your choice of ornament shows wisdom, [%username].</p>
