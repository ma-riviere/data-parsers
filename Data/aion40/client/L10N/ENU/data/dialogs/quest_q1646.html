          <p>There are many curious things in Heiron. My research focuses on ancient relics and ruins, yet I keep coming across things I've never dreamed of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not to mention all the different types of Undead--many unknown anywhere else.</p>

          <p>What really fascinates me is the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater4_44_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Divine Sea Spirit is shaped like a ball of water. But if you destroy one, you get an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1646a]--a beautiful flower-shaped bundle of water energy..</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really want to see one with my own eyes, but Stenon Bay is so far. [%username], how would you feel about getting one for me?</p>

          <p>Oh, good! I understand [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalWater4_44_An] are everywhere in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_F5]. If you follow the coast, you'll be sure to find some.</p>

          <p>There are a lot of mysterious legends about that place....</p>

          <p>By studying some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1646a]s, perhaps I can discover what they really are.</p>

          <p>The Elyos and the spirits once existed peacefully together, but most spirits have turned aggressive.</p>

          <p>Some say the flow of Aether became unstable, but I think we researchers are partly to blame, because we disturb the spirits for our projects.</p>
