          <p>Get the recipes for Lainita's Salad, Lainita's Smoothie, and Lainita's Fish, practice them until you can make the tastiest possible versions, and bring them to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These are complex dishes suited for only the most discerning of palates. I hope you're up for a kitchen stadium fight...and prove that you deserve the title of Expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and if you agree to become a Cooking Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So think carefully before you answer.</p>

          <p>Each dish must balance and accentuate the next...each course must delight the tongue and linger on the palate. It won't be easy, but you've done well so far, [%username]....</p>

          <p>Becoming a Cooking Expert was not an easy path. I won a cooking contest, and then traveled everywhere in Asmodae to study local produce and traditional cooking methods.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Experience carefully refined my taste. But I think your excellent sense of taste is innate.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are walking the path of Expert in another field, you'll have to put Cooking on the back burner until you're done.</p>
