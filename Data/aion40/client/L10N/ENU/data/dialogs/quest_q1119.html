          <p>Hey, wait a minute! You're on your way to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA05_1], right? Please, listen to me for a moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two days ago Lonian came to me requesting a special tonic that I make. He told me he was tired and weak after working in the hot sun and wanted something to reinvigorate him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I make the tonic from hard to find herbs. It's powerful stuff and not to be used lightly. So I just told him I didn't have any left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, Lonian is Lonian. He kept pestering me until I said I'd make him some if I happened on the ingredients in the forest. And he offered to pay a great deal.</p>

          <p>No, no, I have a better plan for Lonian. All he really needs is more exercise, so... I made a tonic similar to what he wants, but instead of the special herbs, I added something else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tree sap! It's not poisonous or anything, but... well, I wouldn't drink it! It'll certainly wake him up though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I'd like you to do, [%username], is take this liquor of mine to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA41] and watch the look on his face when he drinks it. Can you do that for me? You can keep whatever he pays you.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I wish I could be there to see it myself, but I think we both know that he won't want to see me afterward. Or if he did, I certainly wouldn't want to see him, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, once this is over, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA41] will have the sense to not bother me anymore.</p>

          <p>It's this heat! I asked a woodcutter to give me a potion for it, but he's all out.</p>
