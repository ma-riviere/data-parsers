          <p>So, this reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had two options with you: armor or coin. One more immediate, but the other's something you can use as you please. It's also much easier to carry around. So, you got a coin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look puzzled. Never used a coin before?</p>

          <p>Stop your stuttering! Here's how coins work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First off, think of them as just another type of currency. The difference is that you can't use coins in normal shops, but only with contribution reward officers or administration officers like me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can purchase a range of items with coins, such as armor, weapons, and potions. They're all top notch stuff, too. Ready to give them a try?</p>

          <p>Perfect!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now you can get to buying whatever takes your fancy. I have items for combat classes such as Gladiators, Templars, Assassins, and Rangers. Lohaban has items for magic classes such as Clerics, Chanters, Sorcerers, and Spiritmasters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make sure to speak with the right administration officer for your class!</p>
