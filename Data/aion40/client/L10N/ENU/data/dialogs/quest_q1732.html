          <p>Those bone daggers? I made them as, uh, a gift for someone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, there's an ecologist named Lamia who studies the Twilight Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's always tracking some dangerous creature or other. I thought a good dagger would be helpful.</p>

          <p>Well, uh...yes. And the dagger turned out beautifully, but I can't take it to her. If she saw me as I am now she'd faint!</p>

          <p>Well, someday I'll be myself again. With that in mind I'd better tell her, right?</p>

          <p>Enough! Just take it to Lamia and tell her I carved it for her.</p>

          <p>When I first saw the Abyss, I felt pure excitement. So many things to study, such research to do!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In time, I realized no matter how I exhaust myself, there's always more to see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I have a Daeva's lifetime to immerse myself. Why rush? Be methodical.</p>

          <p>You say Ladacus crafted this for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm quite surprised. I never expected an artist's soul in someone so bloodthirsty. And I certainly never thought he had feelings for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Should I accept this dagger? Well, I doubt anything will come of it. And I suppose it might be pleasant to have an admirer...or two.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to the Twilight Battlefield and delivered the dagger for him. Lamia was surprised by Ladacus's tenderness, but unsure about accepting his gift. In the end, she decided having an admirer might be amusing.</p>
