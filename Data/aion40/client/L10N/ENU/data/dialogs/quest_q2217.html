          <p>I've been thinking about that knot you brought me, [%username], and I'm a little concerned.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Those MuMu are up to something--something they don't want us to know about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the arrival of the Black Claw Tribe--that is even more troubling!</p>

          <p>Not really sure, but I know someone who might have the answer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've always been impressed by the depth of knowledge that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gefion] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_19] has. He speaks eloquently on a number of subjects and knows many learned people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If anyone knows what to do with this, he will. I've prepared a report on what we've learned and included the Grass Knot in the envelope. Would you take it to him?</p>

          <p>Gefion will surely know our next move or know someone else who can puzzle this out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps we can head off a serious problem with the Black Claw Tribe as a result. Commander Suthran will have to take us more seriously then.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please hurry. I'm getting more worried by the minute.</p>

          <p>I might be making too much of this, but if the MuMu and Mau are planning something, we could be caught completely unprepared--or it could be nothing at all. </p>

          <p>A Grass Knot, eh? That is a serious development indeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The MuMu haven't used these in quite some time. I'd best send this to High Priest Balder in Pandaemonium. His studies on the subject are more extensive than mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please relax and enjoy the hospitality of our village. I'll have word sent to Olenja as well.</p>
