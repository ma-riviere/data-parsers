          <p>The Hoarfrost Mau were a tribe allied with the Balaur. The Balaur betrayed them, slaughtered them.</p>

          <p>There's an old saying, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend." The Hoarfrost Mau need a friend...as do we.</p>

          <p>Centurion Svafnir, something of a scholar, was sent to Beluslan to forge an alliance with the Hoarfrost. I want the data he's working with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must know the current state of the Mau, their weaknesses, their strengths. How committed to revenge are they?</p>

          <p>It makes sense, really. The Balaur battles in the Abyss will be considerably different from the fighting here.</p>
