          <p>Exactly. Half the Asmodian troops are wearing loot off the dead. And those who aren't are led by information taken from the dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like this letter: loot. Loot off an Elyos Guardian. The Elyos is cryptic, but it smells to me like sensitive military information. General Hisui should see this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But she has no love for me. I doubt she'd pay it any heed if I delivered it to Reshanta.</p>

          <p>No. She can't read it any more than I could. But you can take it to another.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the Red Hasia Legion, there are scouts with some skill with languages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the document to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Glati] in the Krakon; she knows the Elyos language.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this is as important as I think, she'll know what to do with the translated document.</p>
