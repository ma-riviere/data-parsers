          <p>I heard we have to stay here in this area until the Kerub problem is solved. We work long, hard hours, the pay is poor, and some villagers feel that paying mercenaries means they can treat us as their servants!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a hired blade, not a sky-happy courier! I deserve more money than this. So I started looking into a few ventures of my own. I asked around town and think I've struck gold, so to speak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the villagers--they all love mushrooms! They grow underground, and if you know where to dig, you can make quite a bit selling them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best part is, the villagers are too scared of the beasts out here to gather them on their own! The only problem facing me now, is the competition.</p>

          <p>Ha. Not exactly. I'm talking about the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA135]s. They eat mushrooms like Asmodians eat dirt and are happily chewing their way through my profits right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was thinking, if two of us work together, we could eliminate the competition! We both cull a few of the Bellepigs, and I'll make sure you get a healthy cut of the profit I make.</p>

          <p>Just head a little further into the forest, and you'll find plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA135]s to get started on. We'll meet back here when you're done.</p>
