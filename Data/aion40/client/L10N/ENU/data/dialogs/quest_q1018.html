          <p>Seems like every week I hear of some new Krall plot. They grow bold, [%username]. Bold and defiant.</p>

          <p>The last general here thought we should hide behind walls and wait for them to go away. I prefer a more...direct approach.</p>

          <p>We must attack them now. We must rend and burn and slay until none are left to infest Elysea. When the last drop of Krall blood falls from my blade, then I can rest.</p>

          <p>Tell me, [%userclass]. Did you slaughter the Tursin Krall as you were bade, and bring fifty of their marks?</p>
