          <p>I've been traveling with my bow at my side for many decades now. I call it Windwhisper. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sentimental, I know, but one grows fond of a good weapon. Though some cast aside weapons as soon as they get new ones, I prefer to let the weapon age along with me.</p>

          <p>Lately I've thought it'd be wise to upgrade Windwhisper a little. Anteros, a Weaponsmithing Master in Sanctum said he'd upgrade it for me, but I'd need some [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_metal_n_r_40a].</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>It's been slipping my mind for nearly ten years now, though. I simply never find the time to gather the ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you could bring some to me? You seem like a Daeva with a lot of time on your hands.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much for your kindness.</p>

          <p>Orichalcum is everywhere in Heiron. The Kishar Village, IndratuÂ Barracks, and Dragon's Blood Canyon nearby might be the best places to start looking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll take some persistence to find all the [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_metal_n_r_40a], but keep your chin up!</p>

          <p>Thank you so much, again. I'll send this off to Sanctum right away--though not without some trepidation.</p>
