          <p>I took an order for some plate armor last week, and yesterday I received the three hundred steel ingots I'd need to make it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was just setting out my tools a minute ago, when I realized I'm three ingots short. I can't delay the armor. Lavirintos is going to the Abyss tomorrow for a Legion inspection and he needs the armor by then!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Well, if you're offering help, I'd be a fool to turn you down.</p>

          <p>If you could somehow replace the three ingots I've lost, I'll be able to get the armor made and ready in time for the inspection.</p>

          <p>What do you say, [%username]? Will you be able to get me three steel ingots?</p>

          <p>Oh, you may have just saved the day, [%username]! If you already have all the Iron Ore and Charcoal Briquettes, you can forge Steel Ingots on the table over there. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you don't have the materials, then I'm afraid you'll have to travel to Tolbas Forest for the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_81j]. Remember to collect spares before you come back. You may ruin a few ingots before you manage to get a perfect sample! The charcoal, though, you can buy from merchants around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now please hurry. I can only do so much with the materials I have before I'll need the full quota of ingots.</p>

          <p>I'll have to tell Lavirintos if I can't get more ingots from somewhere else soon. He'll be furious with me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please reconsider, [%username]. You only need to go to Tolbas Forest to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_81j], and the rest of the process can be carried out here in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>What? I don't understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's quite simple, [%username]. You just need two things to make steel ingots, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_metal_n_c_81j] and Charcoal Briquette. Fetch them and forge them into steel ingots. That's all I need!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, [%username]. I'm desperate for help and have no one else I can turn to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must fetch the three steel ingots for me!</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, plate armor is so complicated to make that you need to have all the ingots together before you can start forging it. Everything folds together, you see. This causes headaches for most blacksmiths.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll get started right away on Lavirintos' armor. I think I should have enough time to spare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, [%username]. Please take this.</p>
