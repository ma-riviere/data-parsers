          <p>The scales of war are tipping in favor of Asmodae, due in part to your merciless slaughter of Rank 9 Elyos Soldiers. However, [%username], you must know that killing a few soldiers is not enough to decisively change the outcome of battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must not cease the assault on our enemies! Death to the insipid Elyos! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready for a new task? Will you risk your life and wings against a deadlier target? </p>

          <p>Good! You have proven your worth against the lowest ranks of Elyos soldiers, now it is time for you to confront more experienced foes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their Rank 8 Elyos Soldiers have been tested in battle, and will no doubt be harder to vanquish. Yet defeating them will strike a bitter blow against the Elyos.</p>

          <p>Excellent. I was certain that I could rely on you.</p>
