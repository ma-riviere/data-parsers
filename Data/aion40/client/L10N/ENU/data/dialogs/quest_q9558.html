          <p>Young Daevas never believe how much Sanctum has changed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I first came here, everyone was starving and poor. Look at the city now, with its splendid buildings and fancy clothes--I'd scarcely recognize it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was tough in those days, but we survived. You made do with what you had, even if the entire troop had to share a pot of Sparkie porridge.</p>

          <p>I'm here to create a new drink never before seen in Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I love collecting fruits and herbs, and trying new combinations--I'm rather famous for it, actually. Every drink has different effects on those who drink it, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I consider it both an art and a science, and myself both a scientist and an artist.</p>

          <p>Yes, but I wonder if I've lost perspective. For all I know, I might be the only person who likes my new drink, and all my work would be for nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd much rather create something a lot of different kinds of people will like, but that's going to require some research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you visit some people I have in mind, and ask them what they like in a drink? Their opinions would inform my work nicely.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. First, I'd like you to ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Trillian]. He's the son of my oldest friend, and I trust his judgment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next I'd like the opinion of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo3]. I think I should take a Shugo's taste into account--I'm inventing a drink for everyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, meet up with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Myrtil]. A Daeva of Art should have a keen sense of taste.</p>
