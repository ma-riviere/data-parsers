          <p>The Lepharists have a very strong position up in that Bastion, and I've been giving a lot of thought as to how we can get around that. I might have come with an idea. Drinking water!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it. They must need an incredible amount of water for all those workers and trainees, especially in this hot and dry climate.</p>

          <p>So, I'm investigating their water supply. I hope that examining the composition of the water they drink will lead us to its source.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we could the somehow deny them access to their water, it'd put a real dent in their ability to operate here. Plus, it wouldn't hurt for us to have access to another source of water too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need samples of the water they drink. Would you be willing to get them?</p>

          <p>I've observed them for a while, and all the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_3303all] carry [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3303a]s around their waists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I presume they're for water, so please get me some of those bottles.</p>

          <p>Does it not seem important enough?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it's much more important than just killing a few Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, if this works out, we might be able to force their operations completely out of Eltnen.</p>

          <p>Goodness...these are quite heavy. Most of them are empty but I'll see what I can get out of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, as you have brought the bottles, I'll give you what I promised. Please accept this Golden Lepharist Insignia.</p>

          <p>I've heard Laigas is collecting them. Visit me again when you have time, and I'll have more work for you.</p>
