          <p>It's so cold lately! And my clothes are all worn-out, which isn't helping anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think leather clothes would keep the cold out nicely, but it's not easy to come by when I can't go out hunting.</p>

          <p>Oh, there are far too many Mosbears out there. A Human like me wouldn't come back alive. If only I could get to the babies without disturbing the mothers....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hey, maybe you could help me out? Could you bring me some Mosbear Cub's Leather?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mothers remain uncomfortably close to the young, so you'd need to be careful. I'll pay you--will you do it?</p>

          <p>Thank you so much!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many Mosbears in the Basfelt Hunting Grounds, but remember that it must be the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2224a]. I think 6 should be enough for a new set of clothes.</p>

          <p>You're quite right. This isn't the time to worry about clothes, not with everyone on edge about Mosbears and the Lepharists.</p>

          <p>I was a fool to ask.</p>
