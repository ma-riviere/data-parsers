          <p>It is time for the ritual. I sense the Aetheric tempest rising.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sealed in Indratu Fortress is the soul of the Dragon Sword. I'll give you this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3908a], which can summon the Dragon Sword's avatar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's normally lifeless, but when the Aether reaches its xenith that unique ability awakens.</p>

          <p>Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF3_Castle_Indratoo] and search for the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDLF3Indratoo_FOBJ_Q3908]. Use the Calling Stone to awaken the artifact and the Drake will show itself.</p>

          <p>The Dragon Sword chooses its master, so the Drake must submit to you.</p>
