          <p>No. I would find it strange if a small hunting village had anything worth taking. Still, that begs the question of why they're here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've noticed that a carriage appeared just off the road on the way to their hideout, and they've been fussing with it ever since.</p>
