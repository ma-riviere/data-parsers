          <p>I hear that the path to Alukina's Palace is open again. I think of all those who've tried to gain entry time and time again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If vast treasures and unspeakable wealth await those who can avoid a certain death...well, you weed out the stupid quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's impossible to climb down a thousand foot cliff holding onto a mossy rope. Very possible to fall, however.</p>

          <p>But assuming you survived the descent, you'd be welcomed with open arms by Seirens, whose very voice can kill, as well as other terrible creatures.</p>

          <p>Now, armed with the right kind of information, a Daeva just might be able to do it.</p>

          <p>You'll see a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF3_Coral_Q2585] when you enter Alukina's Palace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's no ordinary coral, but a very rare type that few know about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please return with seven pieces of Coral. I'll sell them at a high price and split the profits with you.</p>
