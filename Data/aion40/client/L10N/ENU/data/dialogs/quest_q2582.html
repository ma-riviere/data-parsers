          <p>Last time when we went out to get some firewood, Benyar of the Watch said something that made me think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He asked if we'd stay here and protect them until they grow old and die. He said we're making them too dependent on us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I felt insulted at first, but what he said wasn't wrong. We might have to leave at any time if our superiors order it.</p>

          <p>I've been thinking about that. We need to find ways to push the Humans toward living more independently. I teach them how to fight whenever I have time, and send the Watch members to less dangerous places on their own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now they want to go to the harbor to check the state of the ships and forage. I think it's too dangerous, but I don't want to crush their spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I was wondering, would you be willing to go there in advance and make the area safer, [%username]? </p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you, [%username]. Go to the Anair Harbor and clear the area of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WaterwormIceD_37_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WaterwormIceD_39_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without them around it will be much easier for the Watch, and they'll gain even more confidence when they return safely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please keep this to yourself. The Watch members would be humiliated if they ever learned of this.</p>
