          <p>Oh in the name of Lady Yustiel, I wish we'd get some relief from this oppressive heat! I've been here for a while now but I never get used to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was raised in Eltnen, so you'd think the heat wouldn't bother me, but it's dry in Eltnen. You never get the humidity we have here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I didn't have Cold [%dic:STR_DIC_gb_herb_n_c_30b] Tea, I'd probably go insane. I'd offer you some, but unfortunately it just ran out.</p>

          <p>Of course not. I'm sure I have some more. All you need to make it is Dried [%dic:STR_DIC_gb_herb_n_c_30b] Leaves. Steep them in boiling water and then add ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It tastes good and cools you off! I learned about it from a villager. It's their secret to beat the heat, passed down for generations.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>I'll just get out some dried [%dic:STR_DIC_gb_herb_n_c_30b] leaves from my...oh, wait. It's empty! I'm out! I can't make more tea!</p>

          <p>Don't even joke about it, [%username]. You might be sweating, but you can look forward to leaving. Soon you'll be off to Sanctum or someplace else cool and comfortable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The tea doesn't just cool me off. It relaxes me and helps me forget that I'm not going to get out of here for a long time.</p>

          <p>The villager who brings me the amalils isn't due to visit for weeks, and there's no way I can go out and gather it myself in the jungle. Would you...?</p>
