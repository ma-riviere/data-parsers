          <p>The Observatory allows us to monitor the Aetheric field in and around Verteron, and make sure there are no disturbances to its balance. The Aether must circulate or else...well, best not to think of that. Imagine what would happen if you forgot to breathe. Aether makes life possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's the magnitude of our task here. The whole of Atreia is bound by Aetheric power, and it is our duty to watch over it. It takes centuries of learning to become qualified. It's not a path for the lazy or fickle.</p>
