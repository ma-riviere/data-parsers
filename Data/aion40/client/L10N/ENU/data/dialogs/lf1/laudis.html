          <p>I'm not easily frightened, [%username]. I've stood up to the Krall, to Frillnecks, to anything and everything that this region can throw at us. But there's one creature I absolutely cannot stand: potcrabs.</p>

          <p>Eeeew. They're disgusting, scurrying round and scavenging all the rotten meat they can stuff into their poisonous little shells.</p>
          <p> </p>
