          <p>See this fishing rod? Namus made it for me; he has amazing skills with wood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I almost feel bad for fishing with it, it's really a piece of art.</p>
	  			<p> </p>

          <p>Not all of it, though it is my biggest passion in life.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Just yesterday I caught the most beautiful fish, with delicate fins and scales that shimmered in the sunlight.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I found myself just staring at it, and in the end just let it back into the lake. To kill such a thing... I'd have felt so guilty.</P>

          <p>I fish for two reasons. There's the sense of achievement in catching a struggling fish, sometimes it takes hours to wear one down enough to reel it in.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>I also like to record the various kinds that live in the lake. Most of the time I pull out fish I've seen before, but every now and then I come across something new.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Ben will never understand that...for him, fishing is just a job.</P>

          <p>We share a love of fishing, but have entirely different perspectives on the creatures we catch.</p>
          <P> </P>          
          <P>For example, the fish I told you about before. I told Ben about it and he complained, called me a simpleton, and wouldn't stop telling me how much money I could have made selling it to a Daeva in Verteron.</P>

          <p>You have changed since your ascension...your skin glows with vitality. It reminds me of a fish I once caught.</p>
