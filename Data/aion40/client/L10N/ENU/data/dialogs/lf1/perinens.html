          <P>Rumor has it you were a mercenary in Akarios. Is that true? Oh don't worry, I'm no snob. Good combat sense and fulfilling your duty...that's what counts with me.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>In fact, I think Akarios was blasted lucky a mighty Daeva was serving as a mercenary! I'm sure the Kerubar fled rather than face you!</P>
