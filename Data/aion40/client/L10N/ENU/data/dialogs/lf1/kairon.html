          <p>I work hard to ensure our citadel remains strong and its inhabitants safe.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>We must protect our people, [%username]. We may be the blessed, the chosen, but remember it was not solely the Daeva who were delivered here. Humans were brought here by Aion, too, and we must defend them with each and every breath we take.</p>

          <p>You do? Or are they simply words you speak to appease me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>Ah...forgive me. I've seen a creeping arrogance in our Daeva recently, a feeling that's grown from prejudice into words and actions. But we must not forget our origins.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <P>Even the strongest flower is nothing without its roots. While we Daeva may reach for the skies with our brilliance and our beauty, it is Humans who nurtured this world. It is they who still ascend to join our ranks.</P>
