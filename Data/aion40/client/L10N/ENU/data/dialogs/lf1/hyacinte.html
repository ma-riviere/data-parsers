          <p>Why does Sanctum never listen to me? Tolbas Village is in desperate need of supplies, but I must stock up on weaponry or we won't have a village to worry about feeding! My budget doesn't allow for both, and neither need can be ignored.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how we're expected to get by without more Kinah. The soldiers need outfitting, and armor doesn't grow on trees.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Yes, that is true. The Guardians are all Daevas from Sanctum. Their nobility is beyond question--indeed the light of Ariel herself seems to course through their veins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The people look to them for protection, and they do not let us down. In fact, I've heard them call the Guardians "the Shields of Elysea." I couldn't think of anything more fitting.</p>

          <p>Faith and arms!</p>
