          <p>A skilled Mage is a being at one with the Aether around them.</p>

          <p>Respect the Aetheric energies around us and they will give you power, even if you aren't one of the ascended few.</p>

          <p>Wielding magic really isn't that difficult. I'm no Daeva, but still I can manipulate the Aether and summon fireballs and sheets of ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The villagers think me some kind of genius, but I have seen a Sorcerer at work. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know the true potential that Aether has for the Daevas of this world, and how limited my merely Human abilities are in comparison.</p>

          <p>Exactly! The ascended were all Human once, but have become so much more after receiving their blessing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just imagine the potential gained, simply through the process of ascension!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps I'll be chosen one day, and show the other villagers what true magic is.</p>
