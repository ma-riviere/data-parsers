          <p>I'm still a little green myself. I don't mind admitting it. This is my first sentry mission so I'm picking things up as I go. Real duty is nothing like training. If I lose my concentration for a moment, I risk people's lives. Everyone is counting on me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd much rather face down the enemy in straight combat. No matter how exhausting combat may be, it's nothing compared to the mental strain of sentry duty. And I have to keep an eye on every last man, woman and child here! But orders are orders. A Guardian does what is asked.</p>
