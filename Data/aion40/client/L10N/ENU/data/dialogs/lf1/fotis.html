          <p>Are you still being given the little jobs, or have you finally been noticed by your superiors?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even the most skilled [%userclass] needs to get their name noticed if they want to get the bigger contracts. Saving lives, chasing hostile Sapiens; it's all very noble, but if the right people don't see or hear about it, then you may as well be on village guard duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took me a good while to get noticed, but after four...no, five jobs, the Captain knew I was capable and entrusted me with a very big job.</p>

          <p>Ha! Ummmm...it doesn't matter. All you need know is that it lined my pockets for a very long time.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I hear the Captain is struggling to find good, trustworthy recruits these days.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Now's the time to catch his eye, and make yourself a pretty penny or two, [%username]!</P>
