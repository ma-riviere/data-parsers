          <p>At first. But Belbua showed me a few things. What grows where, what's good to eat or what'll eat you, what'll poison you just fer lookin' funny at it. And the folks in Tolbas are mighty pleasant too. </p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I miss Belbua. We used to pass the time talkin' when he came out here a gatherin' herbs, but he's not been around in a long while.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>Now there's strangers campin' out all over his land, all with the same mean look in their eyes. Some harm's come to Belbua. I'm sure of it.</P>
