          <p>I haven't seen you around here before. You must not be a Verteron native. Either that or you're very good at hiding!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find your way around this place in time, no doubt. Of course, some places are much friendlier than others. Which ones? Well, that would be telling! Find out for yourself.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's it, you see. Better to learn things for yourself than have everything handed to you on a platter. That's how I was brought up, at any rate.</p>

          <p>It's true! I've learned from my experiences, and I'm the richer for it. Sure, I've my fair share of scars, but each one has taught me something and I'm grateful for 'em!</p>
