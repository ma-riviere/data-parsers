          <p>Verteron used to be prosperous, bountiful, and a genuine paradise, even compared to other parts of Elysea! It was nicknamed "The land of eternal spring," because everything was forever in bloom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, nearly as beautiful as Roseino.... When the first rays of sunlight struck Verteron soil, that's when this place really became the place it is today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now...now winter, strange groups, and aggressive creatures dominate. I only hope Roseino makes it through this hardship...and Verteron too....</p>
