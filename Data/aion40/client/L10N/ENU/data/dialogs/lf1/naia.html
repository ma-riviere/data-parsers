          <p>Now where's he gone? Lostes is the most irritating man I've ever had the misfortune to meet...or marry.</p>

          <p>Oh, excuse me Daeva. I don't suppose you've seen my husband? He's the shifty-looking one.</p>

          <p>I keep running into Abolos, the Watch Captain. It's embarrassing. My husband Lostes is supposed to be working for him, but he's never anywhere he should be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's probably sleeping in the Tolbas Forest right now. One of these days, he's going to get caught...part of me looks forward to it.</p>
