          <p>Once they were normal trees, but like all living things, exposure to Aether changed them. Most Elim don't interest me at all: I'm here to make money, not talk to plants.</p>

          <p>Even [%dic:STR_DIC_LA10] will only cut the trees that [%dic:STR_DIC_LA51] allows. He's either a wise woodcutter, or a superstitious fool.</p>
