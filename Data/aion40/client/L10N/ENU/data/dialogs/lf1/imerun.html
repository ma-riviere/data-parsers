         <P>Everyone has opinions about the Watch. But it makes no difference to me. Becoming a member was one of the proudest moments of my life.</P>
         <P> </P>
          <P>Without our swift action, Tolbas would be a smoking heap of rubble. I've lost count of the number of times we've repelled invaders or driven away thieves.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I don't suppose you've heard how the Watch was formed?</P>

          <p>Well, after war broke out in the Abyss. Everyone was terrified. We'd been ushered into a strange new age of tension and fear. But, we never thought it would appear right on our doorsteps...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then strange creatures attacked. These were no scouting parties. People were dying. We received no help, no support from anywhere. In the end, a cadre of volunteers stepped up to defend the village. What they lacked in experience, they made up in spirit, determination, and loyalty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those courageous people, bound by a pact to defend the innocent, were the founders of the Tolbas Watch.</p>
