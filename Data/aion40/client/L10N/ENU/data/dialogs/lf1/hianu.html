          <p>Have you come here for something in particular? It's just...well, if you're here to admire the scenery, I'd advise you to move on. The critters are hungry, and they won't think twice about dining on Daeva. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all right for me--I'm a hunter. I know their habits, their ways. To catch a beast you have to think like one.</p>

          <p>Most villagers are happy tucked safely in their homes. They don't often come this way. I can't say I'm not glad; they'd only get themselves into trouble and yell for help, and I've enough to do. Especially now with the contaminated creatures showing up everywhere.</p>
