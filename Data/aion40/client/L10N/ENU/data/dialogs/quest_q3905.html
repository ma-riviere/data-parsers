          <p>[%username], I've been waiting for you. As I've watched you, I've noticed you've a veritable storm of Aether flowing through you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suspect you're perfect for what I have in mind. Tell me, have you heard of the Dragon Sword?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragon Sword is a fabulous blade that chooses its master. Not just anyone can wield it.</p>

          <p>The Dragon Sword scatters itself into eight pieces after its master dies. Its last master was a Balaur warlord who perished in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If one has all eight pieces and conducts a ritual while channeling a staggering amount of Aether, the sword may choose that Daeva as its master.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did I mention that the flow of Aether is peaking soon? That only a truly gifted Daeva might shape it?</p>

          <p>It's possible. I can help you find the pieces of the blade, but only you can choose to forge it anew.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have no use for such a treasure and yet I would give much just to behold it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest journeying to Reshanta's lower layer to recover the first three pieces.</p>

          <p>Three fragments comprising the upper part of the sword are hidden in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Divine_SZ_All], the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Eciel_SZ_All], and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Wciel_SZ_All].

          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring those to me first, but make haste. The treasure boxes containing the blade fragments will disappear if too much time passes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And bring me 2.4 million Kinah. It's expensive to restore a fine beauty like the Dragon Sword.</p>

          <p>The legend said you must first gather all eight pieces and then hold a ritual at the time when the Aether is at its zenith. You began by gathering three of the eight pieces, which were hidden in the Reshanta lower layer.</p>
