          <p>Pardon me, Daeva. I overheard that you will soon be leaving for Theobomos?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hoping to ask you for a favor. I need to deliver something to someone over there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a small item, so it shouldn't burden you at all. Would you mind terribly?</p>

          <p>Just this silver badge, not big at all, see? We had a few Fortuneers here before you arrived...and one took an interest in me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was really sweet, but he gave me this badge as some kind of token of his love for me. Surprising, right? A Fortuneer? I thought they were all heartless treasure hunters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I can't accept his token or his love. He's a drifter, you know? But I can hardly go all the way to Theobomos to tell him that. And I'm a little frightened of how he might react. Could you...if you're headed there?</p>

          <p>Please tell him what I just told you. Tell him I appreciate the thought, but I don't think we are meant to be. Tell him sweetly, though. You know how those Fortuneers take everything to heart....</p>

          <p>He said he was headed to the village of the Theobomos Aetheric Field Observatory, so you might want to start there.</p>

          <p>Hey! Where did you find it? I've been looking all over for this badge. I thought I lost it in Jeiaparan Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I gave it...I gave it to some woman? What was her name? Aife? Aifo? Sweet Ariel, I have no memory of that!</p>               
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess I hit the tavern pretty hard that night.... I must have been taken by her. I would never give this badge away...it's for Fortuneers, the best and the brightest! Well, thanks. I owe you one.</p>
