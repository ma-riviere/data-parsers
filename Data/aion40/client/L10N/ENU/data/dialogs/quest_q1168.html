          <p>We should have planned better before we set out on the Great Pilgrimage.</p>

          <p>We had to pass through the Dukaki Settlement to get here, and I thought it'd be easy after that. Turns out nothing worth doing is easy, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Ever since my husband and I met, we've shared our dream of making the Great Pilgrimage.</p>

          <p>Miraju's Holy Ground calls to me. I must not let my spirits fail.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm so exhausted, though. I don't have the energy to fight off the Gryphus. Would you help me?</p>

          <p>Clearly you understand the significance of the Great Pilgrimage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the cave just ahead, you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA81]s growing in abundance. These aren't just ordinary fungi--they have the power to induce sleep. I hope to use them on the Gryphus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could get me five of them, I could put them to sleep, which is easier on my conscience than killing them.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do be careful in the cave, though--I've seen Arachnas scampering around in there.</p>

          <p>That's them! Oh, well done, Daeva. You've brought all the [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA81]s we need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, all I need to do is scatter them across the grass, and the Gryphus will become victims of their own greed. There's a lesson there, and I'll remember it well.</p>

          <p>You have my sincere gratitude. Miraju's Holy Ground awaits!</p>
