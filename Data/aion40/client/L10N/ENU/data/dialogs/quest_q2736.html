          <p>Some Daevas gossip about you being a thief, a rebel, and a coward--it's a crock of porgus-poo. You are here in the Abyss for three reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, to defend your homeland and loved ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, for your own self-respect, because you can't imagine being anywhere else. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And third, because you're a real Asmodian and real Asmodians don't shirk from a fight.</p>

          <p>Your history is just that... history.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your future is all that matters, and your future is what you make of it starting today. Not only your future, but Asmodae's future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a mission for you: defeat enemy [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2736]s in the fortresses of Reshanta's lower layer. Taking out the gatekeepers will pave the way for our legions to take the fortresses.</p>

          <p>I need you to defeat a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2736] from each fortress of the lower layer: the Siel's Western Fortress, the Siel's Eastern Fortress, and the Sulfur Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use your resources wisely. Build a large fighting force. It would be foolhardy to attempt this with only one group of Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Watch the map for the appropriate time to strike. You will find the gatekeepers when the fortress battle begins.</p>
