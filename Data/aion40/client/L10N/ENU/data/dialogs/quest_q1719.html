          <p>Sakmis has commended you on your fighting skills. I have need of someone with your talents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are a number of Asmodians who have inflicted disproportionate losses on us. Some are veterans, others are just talented.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say what you will about the trogs, they're fierce fighters. If they weren't, the war would be over by now.</p>

          <p>Asmodian officers rank from one star to five stars.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One-star officers will be the least experienced, and five-star officers are their elite troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently they've taken it on themselves to hunt our patrols in this area. I need someone to get out there and give them a bloody nose, to discourage their brazen attacks. Can you do it?</p>

          <p>I'm glad to see you measure up to your reputation for bravery, but don't take this lightly. You'll be facing veteran troops. Your advantage is that they won't be expecting to face someone with your prowess, so take advantage of that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hit them hard, and take down as many as you can. I want them to think twice before they send hunters out to attack my patrols again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Feel free to recruit some colleagues. The more Asmodians you can drop, the better. Make sure they're worth killing. Always make sure they're worth killing.</p>
