          <p>We all heard the news, Asmodian. Israphel's re-emergence should be something to celebrate, but if his was a self-imposed exile, and we have no reason to believe otherwise, then his timing indicates critical importance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have mobilized our scouts in an effort to understand more about Siel's Relics, but for now, there is little we can do. Instead, I have a task that requires some expert attention. I was pointed to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's about the Balaur. Their forces are preparing for something, though we have not been able to ascertain exactly what. I tasked [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nyitia] of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_01] with finding out more. Please, if you can, go to her.</p>

          <p>You! You're [%username]! You helped kill off the Klaws just recently, right? And now you're here to help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How much did Garnon tell you? You know this is about the Balaur, I hope. Something's changed in them recently, like they've been given an urgent task and are furiously working to complete it. They're poking around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1] as we speak!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need your help, Asmodian. We may not know what the Balaur are up to, but we all know that if the Balaur want it, we don't want them to have it. Please, confront them. Attack their [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_DrakanRa_noble_58_An]s, and see if any of them have information.</p>

        	<p>What? No! [%username], we know of only one way to render ourselves immune to the power of Siel's Relics, but it requires centuries of training and inhuman levels of discipline and skill. Of all the Reian people, there is only one who has the finesse required: a Relic Protector named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Oriatia].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She alone can render Tiamat impotent, but it seems as though the Balaur know of her existence, and they will surely be looking for her. What's worse, we just lost contact with Oriata. She was apparently researching down in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09] when she disappeared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, go to the studio and look for her. We can't afford to have her fall in the wrong hands.</p>

          <p>It's time I intervene once again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think, [%username]. This information that you have, this power, do you really think the Elyos would share it with you? Share it with Garnon, and they'll soon know of it too. And then what? They'll take it for their own purposes, chanting on about divine retribution and deliverance and all that other nonsense they've been brainwashed into thinking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or you could work this out alone. Use the power that the Protector provides, then safeguard the Asmodian blood--not just for now, but for all time. Think about it!</p>

          <p>What?! You were attacked? And what is Israphel up to? One minute he's helping us, next he's leading us back down the path to war with the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could understand this coming from one of our Shedim Lords, but Israphel was never around to become Shedim or Seraphim! Why is he taking the Asmodian side?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ugh. I need to think about this. For now, I think he's right. We don't have to share everything with Garnon, and you're perfectly capable of finding the Protector on your own. I just hope this delicate peace lasts before we can figure out what Israphel is up to.</p>

          <p>Garnon asked for your help in understanding what the Balaur were searching for so vehemently. After visiting their dig site, you learned that they were searching for a Protector, the only person alive with the power to subdue Siel's Relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon learning of the Balaur's intentions, Garnon frantically told you that this protector was last seen in the Jotun Ruins. You went there to find her, only to be attacked by the Elyos. You were about to be killed, when the Empyrean Lord Israphel showed up and saved you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Israphel then warned you against sharing information regarding the Protector with Garnon and argued that, once she knew, the Elyos would find out. And they clearly could not be trusted. You reported back to Aimah. Though she was surprised by Israphel's actions, she agreed that you should search for the Protector by yourself for now.</p>
