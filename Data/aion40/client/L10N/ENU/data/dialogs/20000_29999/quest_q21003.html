          <p>Hey, you're the one who nabbed that Balaur armor for Ipses, aren't you? Ipses said it was some sort of revenge thing?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When she was done testing it, she sold me some of it. And as it turns out, I have a sort of revenge thing too. So I've got the Balaur armor, and I've got the revenge.... The only part missing is you.</p>

          <p>You see, there's this Daeva in Pandaemonium? He used to be my boss, and he was quite a bully. He liked to abuse his power--in fact, he's the reason I'm here in Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He used to comment on everything I said. Nitpicked me to death. Gave me all the hard jobs. Then one day when he was asked to recommend Daevas to be sent to Gelkmaros, he included me on the list! Didn't even ask.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>So will you help me? All I need you to do is wear this Balaur armor, and...give my old boss a good scare. Show him he can't push everyone around. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Thanks! Here's the Balaur armor--I fixed it up a bit, so it'll make you look exactly like a Balaur. Or at least, close enough to count.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just put the armor on, and then creep up on [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Soudan] and, I don't know, jump around a bit. Be scary. Can you do a Balaur voice? Do you speak Balaurish? All the better.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just...be careful. Only put the armor on when you're right near Jakwillem. Otherwise the Pandaemonium Garrison might mistake you for a Balaur and attack!</p>

          <p>I know...it's a dirty trick. But I'm desperate. I can't just sprinkle itching powder on his mane. He sent me to Gelkmaros, blast him!</p>
