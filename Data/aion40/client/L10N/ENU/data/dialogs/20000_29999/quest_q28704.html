          <p>From what the Reians say, Raksang is currently an unholy mix of living warriors and undead forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If only they still fought against each other... But that would be too easy for us, wouldn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know whether the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksah_2F_DrakanFighterCBone_56_Ae]s are alive or undead, but either way, I understand they are very powerful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Hellpath, and slay however may of them you can find, so we may clear the way for future incursions.</p>

          <p>One of the Reian elders says that Raksang is the source of the tremors I've been feeling lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If so, our efforts here are all that more vital. We need ground to fight Tiamat's forces upon, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How went the hunt?</p>

          <p>I've heard many terrible things about Raksang. So many terrible things, that your returning intact seems miraculous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you that strong, or is its reputation overblown? No offense intended--just idle musings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I'm sure there are more Raksang Warriors lurking about. I'll need your help once more if we're to eliminate them.</p>
