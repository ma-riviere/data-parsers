          <p>It reads as follows: "I have read Bridget's report about your experiences with Kromede's Trial. What she had to say was very disturbing indeed."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"But I must be certain that it was Shadow Judge Kaliga you encountered, and whose manor you entered. This is very important."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"I request that you enter the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede] once more and confirm Kaliga's identity for me." What should I tell the Brigade General? That you accept?</p>

          <p>If you don't mind me saying so, this whole [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede] thing is a bit over my head. But then, I'm not in charge here.</p>

          <p>Anyway, let me know what you find out, and I'll pass it on to the Brigade General.</p>

          <p>I saw you sleeping in one of those tents earlier. You seemed peaceful enough, but now that I know what you went through....</p>

          <p>You're a braver Daeva than me, [%username]. I would've thought twice about going in there, Brigade General or no.</p>

          <p>Understood. Shadow Judge Kaliga has been confirmed as the chief judge in Kromede's Trial, and has been defeated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm still not sure what's going on; all I've heard are rumors and random bits. Still, I understand enough to know this is quite a feat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Brigade General appreciates the service you've done her. She gave me this to give you on completion of your mission.</p>
