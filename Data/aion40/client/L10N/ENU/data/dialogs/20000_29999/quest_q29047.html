          <p>Heh, it's nice to know that I still have an effect on those under my authority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't worry, I'm not upset or trying to trap you into saying something you shouldn't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Commendable caution, but I really must insist on speaking with you on this. Return when you're up to it.</p>

          <p>Ahh, good, good. Then I must give you a direct order: Do not tell anyone about him, or your victory over him. I know we should be boasting of defeating the so-called "13th Empyrean Lord," but in this case....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid I can't reveal more at the present. Suffice it to say that the...highest authorities agree that this must be done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for meeting with me. Take this. It's a reward for your service to Asmodae. Or a bribe for your silence, if you like....</p>
