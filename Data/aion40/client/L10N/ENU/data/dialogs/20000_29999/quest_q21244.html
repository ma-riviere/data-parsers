          <p>Ahh, the thrill of discovery! It's moments like these that make scholarship worthwhile!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I killed a Highland Baku that was threatening poor Itar. When I was butchering it for supper, I found a memory quartz in its stomach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur use these stones to record images and experiences. Apparently, this one was dropped and the Baku ate it.</p>

          <p>Ah, that was for me to discover. The hours and days I spent analyzing the images, matching it up to specific locations in Gelkmaros!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From what I can tell, it shows some kind of Balaur research center. The surroundings appear to be near the Petralith Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I need more information. A Dramata Chaser named Batalrion is camped near the Petralith Canyon. Could you talk to him for me?</p>

          <p>If there's any chance there's any kind of Balaur facility in the area, I think he'll know about it. Here's the quartz...show it to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just please don't tell Itar. The poor boy will want to go gallivanting off on his own. He could get hurt.</p>

          <p>The research center you're looking for is called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C5_Lab]. As Batalrion said, it's constantly moved around to avoid discovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we knew where it's settled this time, it could be a major coup for us. Could I see that quartz of Tanar's?</p>
