          <p>I came here to ask Asmodae's aid, but your people's situation here is as precarious as our own, in many ways.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet I have watched you assist those in need, so perhaps you are someone I could talk to.</p>

          <p>Have you heard of the Dragonbound? They are akin to a cult, Humans serving the Balaur with a fanaticism bordering on madness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have been abducting my kin, torturing them, turning them into Dragonbound like themselves. Thus our numbers shrink as theirs grow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This may be presumptuous, but could we ask for your aid against them?</p>

          <p>I thank you. Even a single Daeva assisting us is more than we could hope for.</p>

          <p>One of my kinsmen, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ortiz], is at the entrance of Subterranea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go see him, and tell him that you are aiding me. He will tell you what to do next.</p>

          <p>Of course. As I said, I realize that Asmodae is in dire straits as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet... The Dragonbound are part of the Balaur menace. In a sense, we fight against a common enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will appeal to your Archons one last time. They may not change their minds, but I must try.</p>
