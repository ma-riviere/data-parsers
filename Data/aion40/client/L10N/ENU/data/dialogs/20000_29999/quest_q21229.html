          <p>I'm glad that we hold the Crimson Temple, [%username].</p>

          <p>No, not because of its tactical value! Well...not only because of its tactical value.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you ever heard of Leowasps, [%username]? They're found uncommonly in many parts of Atreia, but here, they gather in great numbers. They're some sort of mutated insect, but that's beside the point.</p>

          <p>Their wings! [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DragonFly_54_An] wings are absolutely delicious! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course you don't eat them raw--that would be gross! But roasted over a campfire...add in a few special spices...and it's like you're in Aion's graces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to gather some Leowasp wings for myself--and the soldiers love them too, so it's not as if this won't aid the war effort. What do you say, [%username], help me out?</p>

          <p>Not all Leowasps will have good wings either.... I mean, you're bound to damage the wings if you're striking the creatures in the face or pelting them with magic, and I don't want damaged goods!</p>
