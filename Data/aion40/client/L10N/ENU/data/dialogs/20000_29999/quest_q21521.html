          <p>Hail, [%username]! I have brilliant news for any [%userclass] worth their salt, worth their rations, worth the blood in their veins!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've found a part of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_05] called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A09_pvp]. Some nonsense Strigik foo-foo tree-magic clashes with Kahrun's Will there and cancels it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Know what that means? Any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30151] you find there is begging to meet your blade! This so-called peace threatens to soften all of us. Go find that Discus, and I'll reward every kill you make!</p>

          <p>A proud [%userclass] returns from the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A09_pvp], head high, eyes aglow, claws rank with Elyos blood!</p>

          <p>It should! You were born to rake Ellie guts across the battlefield, [%userclass], and don't forget it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that worthy Daevas have even received Treasure Boxes for their exploits in the Discus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No Asmodian should need reward for spilling Elyos blood. But still--you have earned this!</p>

          <p>Merlean told you of the Hero's Discus in Ashishav's Nest, where Kahrun's Will did not reach.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was eager to send you there to soak the Discus in Elyos blood, and he reveled in your success when you returned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Merlean claimed that Elyos blood should be payment enough, he was still happy to grant you an additional reward.</p>
