          <p>It's curious how many pets there are in Pandaemonium, all of a sudden. It must be the start of some new fad.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's sad, though, is that so many Daevas don't know how to properly take care of their pets. They don't clean up after them, don't bathe them. It's like they think their pet is some sort of toy, and not an actual living thing.</p>

          <p>If you want to truly relish the joy of having a pet, you must grow an emotional bond together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm told there is someone in Pandaemonium who has mastered the art of communicating with animals. A young girl by the name of [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Silke].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you really wanted to bond with your pet, she'd be a good one to talk to.</p>

          <p>If you head to the back of the square, you'll see [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Silke] right away. She's the one busy chatting to all manner of pets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine what it would feel like conversing with a Porgus. What would they have to say? "Please don't roast me on that fire?"</p>

          <p>Are you afraid to share yourself with a lesser being?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think that must be it. You hide your fear, acting as if you're not interested, but I think eventually curiosity will win out and get the better of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anybody can have a pet, but not everyone can have a true animal companion. I highly recommend you speak with Silke.</p>

          <p>How rude! Do you see that Daeva over there? He just wandered by and said something disparaging about one of the pets. As if the poor thing couldn't understand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pets may not understand our language, but that doesn't mean they don't understand our meaning. I mean, we can't speak with the Elyos, but we certainly know when they're angry, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], please compliment this lovely pet. It'll make him feel so much better.</p>

          <p>Oh, my. You haven't complimented a pet in your life, have you? You're doing it all wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each pet has its own distinctive appearance and unique way of behaving, and each one must be treated as an individual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, watch me. See where my hand goes when I compliment her? You point to the pet and give your compliments. That way she knows you're speaking to her.</p>

          <p>Ninis commented on the fact that so many Daevas have pets nowadays.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ninis said you need to communicate with a pet if you truly wish it good, and advised you to learn that art from Silke.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You met with Silke, and she taught you how to properly compliment a pet.</p>
