          <p>Though rare, the Piece of Zikel is a useless bauble. Yes, useless! Well, the way it is, anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a little like life. The parts rarely make a perfect whole by themselves. It takes effort and determination.</p>

          <p>It also takes knowledge. In this case, specialized knowledge. Very few people have that, and some of them are Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I do know an Asmodian who has everything needed, physically and mentally, to use the Piece of Zikel to its utmost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her name is Usener, and you can find her in Pandaemonium easily enough. There may be just one hitch, though....</p>

          <p>As I said, this process is very specialized, very complex. It may be expensive to achieve.</p>

          <p>I agree. It makes sense to at least hear her opinion on things. The worst anyone in this situation can say is "no."</p>

          <p>If that happens, you're no worse off than you were before. In fact, you may be better off, as you'll have more information.</p>

          <p>No, I'm not busy. Even if I were, I'd drop everything just for you. Most smiths wait fifteen lifetimes to work with what you have now.</p>
