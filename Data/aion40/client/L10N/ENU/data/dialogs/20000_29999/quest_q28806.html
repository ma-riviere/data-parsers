          <p>If I may.... Do you happen to know a Daeva named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Prakon]? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She sells Blooms. We used to be close friends before she joined the merchants in Pernon Plaza. I hardly ever see her now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard she had some fancy boyfriend, but today I heard they have broken up. Perhaps [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Prakon] is not too good for me to be a friend now? Daeva, will you send her my regards?</p>

          <p>All my life, I've been careful with my Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All the furniture in my house is from the Vintage Grabs, I walked instead of teleporting, cooked my own food instead of buying things from merchants. Is that cheap? I thought I was just being careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the other day I got a letter from my boyfriend--no, my ex-boyfriend. He called me a skinflint and said he wanted to live life instead of just scraping by, so he was done with me. That pampered little... ugh, I'm so mad!</p>

          <p>Oh. Yeah, I've had a lot of friends who are servants. They never quite understood me; they are all so concerned about duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My stupid weakling ex-boyfriend didn't know I was saving my Kinah for our wedding. Well, I guess I don't have to do that now. I'm going to spend Kinah like cheap mana potions!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to fill my studio with new furniture. Do me a favor and tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Katenon] that I'll be over soon, okay? I want him to take me shopping--the best merchants, the finest stuff.</p>

          <p>I can't believe I didn't win that house auction. How much do I need to buy a nice house?</p>

          <p>I don't have much money because I recently bought all new furniture.... I should ask Tezz for a raise.</p>

          <p>If he says no, I should ask for a bonus.</p>

          <p>Ah, what I'd do with my own house. I'd decorate the yard like... Wait, Prakon? Going shopping? I heard she broke up with her boyfriend. Is that why?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never understood how she could count Kinah like that. She never had a coin to spare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad she's exploring the wonders of decoration a little. You should try it yourself; it really makes a house a home.</p>

          <p>When you met her, she said her boyfriend left because she lived like a miser.</p>

          <p>She asked you to speak with Katenon, an apparent spendthrift, and invite him to go furniture shopping with her. So you met Katenon, who admitted that he didn't like miserliness either (and learned a little about home decorating in the bargain).</p>
