          <p>It seems a hierarchy of sorts has formed among the Balaur Deserters. I suppose it's as they say--even the Sprigg reign in the forest with no Karnif about....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An Archon patrolling beyond the bulwark told me about this situation. With no leader, all the "middle men" are claiming authority over each other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I find it ridiculous that a ragtag band of defeated Balaur would care about pecking order.</p>

          <p>Ha ha! And they're quite serious about it! They've been banging on the bulwark and causing quite a ruckus, trying to show off their strength to one another, no doubt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I imagine some small fry has taken the top spot, too. What a bother. Obsessed with power, never having possessed it before. Brutality and vicousness, is what that leads to.</p>

          <p>Do you think we should just eliminate this new leader as soon as possible?</p>

          <p>Excellent. I've heard it's [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanFi_NmdQ_52_An] that became the leader. I imagine it's wandering around in the Antagor Battlefield, no doubt surrounded by sycophantic [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanFi_51_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dispose of them all--I want them so demoralized that they won't dare rise up against Asmodae.</p>

          <p>You've been in Gelkmaros for a while now, right? You've probably got a good grasp of the situation here. Do you think it's true that our progress has faltered, compared to the early days?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose so. But what can we do? The lack of Aether has been holding us back....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't afford to show weakness, especially now. And that's why I asked you to take out [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanFi_NmdQ_52_An]. Is the task done?</p>

          <p>Good work, [%username]. We can't let those scattered troops gather again so soon after their defeat. They'll only be all the more dangerous united around a leader.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for dealing with this so quickly. I know this isn't much, but please take it as a token of my appreciation.</p>
