          <p>Aether is the power by which Aion created our world, and the force which holds it together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aether only manifests to a chosen few, even amongst Daeva, and the ability to extract those bits of Aether by Aethertapping is rarer still.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now you stand on the threshold of becoming an Aethertapping Expert--an honor bestowed upon but a select few of our Daeva.</p>

          <p>Ha ha, eager as ever, [%username]. I like that. But hold on a moment. I need to administer a final test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The test is simple, though many Daeva will spend a lifetime working towards achieving it. You need to extract two rare kinds of Aether and bring them to me--the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OD_QUEST_55A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OD_QUEST_55B].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obtain those, and you will be recognized as an Expert. Are you up to the challenge, [%username]?</p>

          <p>As you are my best student, I can't very well send you off without a little something to aid you in your quest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've prepared an Expert Aethertapping Ring, which will maximize your Aethertapping abilities and heighten your sensitivity to Aether. Just talk to Areke to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You won't be able to extract [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OD_QUEST_55A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OD_QUEST_55B] without it, so don't lose it. Return soon to your well-earned title of Expert!</p>
