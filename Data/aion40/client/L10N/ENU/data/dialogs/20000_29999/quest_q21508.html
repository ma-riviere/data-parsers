          <p>Ah! A brilliant idea! I'm a genius!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know the Togs that the Humnaz have domesticated? They're ceaseless theives. They love shiny things.</p>

          <p>If there are [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21508A]s anywhere in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A4_03], I'll wager that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_Tog_57_An]s have stolen some of them. Go on and check--I'm right, I know it!</p>

          <p>Wow. Actual parts of an actual, ancient Petralith!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These would be worth so much on the black market... not that I would ever sell them. No, these are purely for research. All... ten of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait. Are these solid? They should be hollow to hold the... oh, shards! These aren't Petralith fragments, [%username], they're just statues!</p>

          <p>Tanitia said that the Rabid Togs compulsively stole shiny things, so if there were Petralith fragments in the Humnaz territory the Togs would probably have bits and pieces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Surprisingly, she was absolutely right. When you killed Rabid Togs, many of them had Petralith Fragments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You brought them to a pleased Tanitia, who rewarded you, but then realized that the fragments were fakes.</p>
