          <p>Mitrakand is the Balaur's strongest remaining foothold in Gelkmaros. If it's destroyed, this region is fully ours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They know that too, of course, which is why their Drana production is concentrated there, and why it's guarded so well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that any of that decreases the importance of bringing that place down on all their heads.</p>

          <p>So, my superiors have ordered me to start paving the way towards a full-scale siege. We need to start with the Mitrakand Summit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The less time the Balaur have to prepare for an impending attack, the better off we are. But it's as heavily guarded as everything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to take a new approach. I think I have a good one that could use you. Do you want to be involved?</p>

          <p>All right, here's what you need to do: we can only access the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C1_Fire] through a windstream.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the Drana Farm Observation Post and take the windstream there. Then take out their guards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Concentrate on [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C1_DrakanFi_Re_Nmd_55_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C1_DrakanWi_Re_Nmd_55_An]. Without them, the rest will be in disarray.</p>

          <p>There you go! Now we can start planning a major assault while their warning system is down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll still take a while, though. Hopefully the higher-ups are on the ball. The Balaur could revive their Pharoses in the meantime, too. We may need your help again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be sure to let my superiors know you helped out, though. Thanks!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>She asked you to travel to the Mitrakand Summit and take out the soldiers that guard it.</p>

          <p>So you infiltrated the Mitrakand Summit through a windstream and slew the Balaur soldiers. Brynhild thanked you greatly for your efforts.</p>
