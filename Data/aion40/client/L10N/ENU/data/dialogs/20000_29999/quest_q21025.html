          <p>Sorry I'm so jumpy, but look at my finger! It was almost bitten off!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know what did this? A Strigik! I had to beat it on the head many times with my walking stick just to make it let go!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know we Asmodians are supposed to be strong, but I was simply never trained for that kind of fight!</p>

          <p>Indeed, and mine is almost completely in my brain. I can fight--I think--but I'm not nearly as good as a Daeva. Or a Strigik, for that matter. They look fluffy and cute, but watch out!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, the Strigik are what I came here to study, and I must admit...even through my fear, I was fascinated by them.</p>

          <p>Well, I've never seen anything like them in Asmodae. Phylogenetically, they seem similar to Sapiens, but do they have a culture of any kind?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anything I could discover about the native lifeforms could lead to valuable insights regarding Aether in the region, maybe even the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Along with my study of the Strigik, I've been asked to study the effects Tiamat has had on this land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you seen what he's capable of? They say he can literally move mountains.... That kind of power is terrifying.</p>

          <p>Well, the Strigik are part of my job too. Did you find [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_OwllauPack_Q21025]s?</p>

          <p>Mmm, yes, I do, but it's not the sort of thing that'll help me with my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't work from just a limited number of samples--I need enough to allow me to draw some sort of generalized conclusion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I asked for 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_OwllauPack_Q21025]s in particular. I'd appreciate you getting them for me.</p>

          <p>Hmmm...they seem to be used primarily as food storage. I see some dried fruit and fish, insects, grass, even a few stones....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So the Strigik appear to be omnivorous. And not very tidy, besides.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a small start, but it's more than I knew a few minutes ago. And knowledge advances with many such small steps.</p>
