          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. Forgive me for sending a summons out of the blue like this, but there's something important I need to share with you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Long ago, I discovered that I possessed the gift of divinity. It's a curious gift, because it doesn't allow me to see into the future, or even the present. However, I can sense a person's aura.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The intensity of the aura is a direct reflection of that person's destiny, and how it is tied to the fate of all Atreia.</p>

          <p>When I saw you at the ascension ceremony, I saw that your aura was one of the most intense--if not THE most--I've ever sensed outside the Shedim Lords themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are irrevocably tied to the fate of all Atreia, of that I am certain. I was so surprised that I told High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Balder] and Captain [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kvasir]. Now they want to meet you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Chances like these are few and far between. You should go.</p>

          <p>Welcome, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I recognize you.... You recently ascended, did you not? I was there at the ceremony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I imagine coming from Ishalgen, you don't have many friends here in Pandaemonium. Know that the Great Temple welcomes all.</p>

          <p>Ah yes, Veldina. Aion has blessed her with a great gift, though I feel she relies on it too much when judging others. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judgment can be cruel, and wrong. The Elyos believe they are blessed by Aion, and that we Asmodians are forsaken. Asmodae is a harsh land, and we might not be blessed, but we are stronger because of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please.... Visit Kvasir now. Listen to what he has to say. Walk in Azphel's shadow, my child.</p>

          <p>You do have a certain...air about you, though. Make sure to talk to me about the Fenris's Fangs once you've gained a bit more experience.</p>

          <p>The Captain of the Fenris's Fangs is an excellent judge of character, and Veldina's talent for divinity is without question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, the High Priest is resting, and I cannot disturb her at the moment. I will send word when she is able to see you. I bid you farewell, and may the blessings of Lord Marchutan ever follow in your footsteps.</p>

          <p>However, Priest Angulof told you that Agehia was unavailable, and asked you to return another time. </p>
