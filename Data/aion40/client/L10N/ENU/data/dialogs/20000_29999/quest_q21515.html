          <p>We're making rapid progress. Kamena will be a grand commercial square once we're done, all minarets and domes laid with the finest mosaics. Pretty impressive, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only problem is, it's hard to come by construction materials when most of Sarpan's resources are channeled toward our Legions. Right, right, fighting the Balaur is important. But development in Kamar keeps morale up!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no extra metal to make nails, so I've been using [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21515A]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Owllau_fam]. I'll pay you fairly for any you could bring me, eh?</p>

          <p>Let's see... thirty paces by eight paces, seven rods high... we'll need more scaffolding.</p>

          <p>Shards, where am I going to get that from?</p>

          <p>This is enough to keep us going for a week, I think.</p>

          <p>Because so many resources have been redirected to fight the Balaur, Solomon was almost out of nails.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was concerned that halting construction would damage morale, so he sent you to collect Strigik Claws as a substitute for the nails.</p>
