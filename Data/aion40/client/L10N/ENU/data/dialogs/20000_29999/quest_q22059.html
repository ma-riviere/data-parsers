          <p>I have a personal request. I wouldn't ask if I didn't consider you something of a friend, so please, hear me out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm having trouble keeping my hair out of my face since I broke the last of my combs. Who can kill--or cook--in those conditions?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you hunt the Dragonbound's [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_FanaticPet_58_An]s and get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_22059a]s, so I can make a comb from them? It's either that, or I chop it all off.</p>
