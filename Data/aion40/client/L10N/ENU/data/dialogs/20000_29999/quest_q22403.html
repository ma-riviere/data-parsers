          <p>Adella's Orb may be an excellent weapon, [%username], but it is not the best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it. An Asmodian like yourself with an augmented Adellan weapon in your hands? As feared as you are, nothing would dare stand up to you. You'd tear through the Balaur like wings through smoke, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I can only help you if you ask for help. Reians like [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gneise] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lumen] have spent their entire lives perfecting their craft skills. Go to them if you want to see what a true weapon feels like.</p>

          <p>The Asmodian with Adella's Orb. I've heard about you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I can help. With a shard of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ldf4b_weapon_upgrade_01], you have one of the key items needed to strengthen your weapon considerably. But such items are neither found easily nor given freely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will set you tasks. Complete them, and the Malevite is yours. Do we have a deal?</p>

          <p>You need two more items to upgrade your weapon, my shadowy friend. One is in my possession, the other is not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's more, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ldf4b_weapon_upgrade_02] I have is an incredibly rare jewel, awarded to the bravest of Siel's Spear Legion. To earn it, you must pass the challenges I set you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The other item, a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ldf4b_weapon_upgrade_03], can simply be bought. I believe [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ruaka] has them for sale.</p>

          <p>Ulian told you that the power of wizards can be harnessed to strengthen Adella's Orb. You left immediately to meet Grais and Lumen and gathered the items required to complete the process. On your return, Ulian upgraded Adella's Orb, morphing it into the even deadlier Siel's Wealthy Orb.</p>
