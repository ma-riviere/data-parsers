          <p>Ah, Daeva, I have been looking for you. I was wondering if you could help me.</p>

          <p>Some other Daevas told me they heard someone crying in the Nunglark Ruins. The other refugees think it's a ghost, but...</p>

          <p>We always thought Master Rhonnam saved all surviving villagers.... Did you ever see any Shulacks there?</p>

          <p>I'm afraid it might be a villager hiding from Balaur and Asmodians. Many Shulacks are afraid of Asmodians, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they'll come out at the sound of a certain flute song. Only Shulacks know it, and only teach it to those they trust, so they'll know that whoever plays it is a friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you were to go to the village and find this poor Shulack.... You would be saving a life.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Here, I'll show you how to play the song.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(She teaches you a simple, yet lively song.)</p>

          <p>You are very good! Try playing it atop a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_FOBJ_Q21105]. I can't tell you why--only that if you do, any Shulack hiding there will hear it.</p>

          <p>If you find anyone, tell them to come here to the Refugee Village. We'll be waiting.</p>

          <p>Really? How disappointing. I hope you don't think that because we are Shulacks, our lives are worth less than that of a Daeva.</p>
