          <p>The Shugo I met told me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said, "Is crucial for love and success! Want to heal wounds in less time? Magnificent Daeva needs energy. Akakakak!"</p>

          <p>It's a potion in a pill that has an energy to invigorate Daevas, leading to fuller and more comfortable lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugo said he'd cured Balder's headache, eased Suthran's love woes, and even cured a small boil on a Methu's wing! I saw him give a dose to a passerby and grow her hair.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can get this magical "Raksang Pill" for us, but first we need three Energy Stones.</p>

          <p>Other than that, I don't know what goes into the Raksang Pill. But I don't have to. I'll get the stones to the Shugo, and then we'll imbibe health and magic.</p>

          <p>The Shugo told me. We just need three Energy Stones, and you can get them from Illusionmaster Sharik, The Flamelord, and Raksha Boilheart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The energy from Raksang coalesces into such stones and gives them their restorative powers.</p>

          <p>The Shugo didn't describe Energy Stones, so I had no idea what they'd look like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you feel any energy coming off them? Supposedly, they invigorate Daevas in miraculous ways. Wait. Wait. I feel it. A floating sensation! Right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell you what. I'll reward you now, and keep the pill for myself once the Shugo makes it. Sound good?</p>

          <p>Merlean learned about a pill that cures all sicknesses, increases your abilities, and even makes you telepathic (but only if you use it correctly).</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though you were skeptical of this mystery Shugo's good intentions, you went to get stones to be used in this miracle medicine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Sharik, The Flamelord, and Raksha and brought their Runeseal Stones to Merlean. He kindly gave you cash instead of a share of his medicine, before he sent off the stones to his Shugo for use in making the elixir.</p>
