          <p>Ragnarok had this? SHARDS! Does that mean you killed it, [%username]? Ragnarok was mine! I was saving it for when I got bored of killing these minions! You're so blasted selfish!</p>

          <p>Brother Ifran...was Lord Marchutan's retainer, and he carried out the Lord's orders issued through this scroll. But...now the scroll is mine! MUAHAHAHA! More killing for Krizarid! Carrying out the Lord's orders often requires violence! Sweet carnage and violence!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But...I suppose I can't abandon the Vorgaltem Citadel...protocols and all that. Which means...YOU! [%username]! You inherit the role of harbinger of destruction! Blast! I'm so envious!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better check the scroll. I'm sure Lord Marchutan has sent a message. You're so lucky, [%username]! Curse my responsibilities!</p>
