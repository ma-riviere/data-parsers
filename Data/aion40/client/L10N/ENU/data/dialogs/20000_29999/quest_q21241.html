          <p>Hail, Daeva. If you've made it here, you must know your way around Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could use someone like you. Someone strong and fearless, experienced in the ways of Balaurea.</p>

          <p>Good. I am a Dramata Chaser. My mission is to find a way into Padmarashka's Cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But while the Balaur may despise the Dramata, they also know their value. The Padmarashka Convoy Legion blocks our access to the cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to pierce their defenses. Do you have what it takes to assist in our efforts?</p>

          <p>Your task is to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_21241]. They are the mortar that hold the Balaur defense together. Without them, it will fall apart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you take some trusted allies with you to back you up. Azphel grant you victory.</p>

          <p>Yes, Dramata chasing is a harsh life, one that swallows the unprepared. You may be wise to refuse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you find your strength up to the task in the future, return. We welcome more allies in our fight against the Dramata.</p>
