          <p>The blasted Aether Generator is starting to get on my nerves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time I tell Pandaemonium it's working fine, it breaks down. Then when I tell them it's broken, it starts working again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems to be functioning perfectly well lately, but who knows when that might change. So I've decided to do something about it.</p>

          <p>The 1st Pandaemonium Research Center thinks that if they examine local creatures for traces of Aether, they can determine if there's something in the Aether here causing the problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I've been collecting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21035a]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fellial_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_MillipedeFish_52_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But those things are vicious--I'm having a hard time doing the collection by myself. Do you have some time to lend a hand?</p>

          <p>Great! Don't worry, I did most of the work. I just need about 25 samples to meet my requirements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, you'll have to slice open [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fellial_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_MillipedeFish_52_An]s to get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21035a]s.</p>

          <p>They won't like that, so be on your guard. I'll stay here to make sure you don't get snuck up on.</p>

          <p>You know, the function of the Aether Generator is your problem too. Without it, you wouldn't be able to function here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe this is a fool's errand, but if there's the slightest chance this could help find the cause of its malfunctions, I think it's worthwhile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sooner this theory is supported or disproven, the better, so I'd suggest coming back to help sometime.</p>

          <p>Sorry, that's not enough. I need 25 more to meet the number I was given.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The scholars already have a theory, you know--that the creatures around here have adapted to Drana energy, and that they've started affecting Aether because of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To me, they're just [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Fellial_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_MillipedeFish_52_An]s, walking [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21035a]s.</p>
