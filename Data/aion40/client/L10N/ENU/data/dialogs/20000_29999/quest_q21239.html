          <p>Of course, of course, mighty Daeva! It's a simple problem, as all would be to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I simply request that you deliver something to an Archon named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gustava].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His present location can only be accessed with a windstream, thus my need for aid. I plead that you might assist me, superb one.</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you, thank you, most esteemed Daeva! My heart soars that you have deigned to aid this unworthy one! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gustava] is in a remote part of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could make a humble suggestion, take the windstream at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_C1_Q1]. You will need to leave it before it ends, however.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your generosity is as vast as the Abyss! I shall tell all I meet of your noble compassion!</p>

          <p>Ah, this is from Lucia, I assume. Quite the character, isn't she? I think she's taking the awe she has of us a little too far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, she's working in Balaurea! Isn't that something? She underestimates her own courage and strength.</p>

          <p>But that's neither here nor there. Thanks for bringing this over. It was probably out of your way.</p>

          <p>Lucia has an item requested by Gustava, but can't deliver it. She asked you (with much meekness) to take it to him for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found Gustava in Viscum Swamp and gave the Weighty Tool Box to him. He was appreciative of your efforts.</p>
