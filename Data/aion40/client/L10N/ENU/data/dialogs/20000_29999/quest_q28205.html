          <p>I'm proud to have watched you develop, [%username]. You truly embody what the Crucible was made to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your allies, as well.... You are all examples for Asmodae to look up to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is but one more stage to go in the Crucible.... Of course, it's the hardest.</p>

          <p>I know you are. But Stage 10 is filled with Balaur from Dark Poeta. These are serious foes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the final opponent.... Well, I don't know where or when Inggness found it, but...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you're not ready to face Stage 10, that's irrelevant. I have to ask.</p>

          <p>I hope you have the strength to back up your confidence. I can count the Daevas who've even come close to conquering Stage 10 on one hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Vanktrist.... Honestly, he terrifies me. Maybe because Inggness is the only one who knows anything about him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tymora] if...when you succeed. Good hunting.</p>

          <p>Yes, this is a serious step. I don't want you to take it unless you're prepared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A serious defeat in Stage 10 would certainly shake those who've watched and believed in you until now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to be able to give a solid performance out there. Steel yourself, then return.</p>
