          <p>Reians see all Daevas the same. To them, since their own people are all one, a Daeva is a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Which is why they've allied themselves with those sun-addled Elyos. Without disturbing our comrades-in-survival, can you put a dent in the Ellies' plots against us? Go to the Naduka Legion Garrison, and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_NPC_Q22051A]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They hide from their destiny at our hands, so take these Seeds of Detection.</p>

          <p>The Reians are always so annoyed with me, just because I don't think we should let the Elyos run roughshod over us.</p>

          <p>The only thing that smooths things over is my Agrint barbecue. But then, everyone loves a good Agrint barbecue!</p>
