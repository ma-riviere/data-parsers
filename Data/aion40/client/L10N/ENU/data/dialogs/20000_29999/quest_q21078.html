          <p>Comparing creatures here in Balaurea to similar ones in Asmodae is one of the most fascinating aspects of my work here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Mamuts, for example. They're mostly known as cold-weather creatures in Asmodae, yet here they thrive in swamps.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only that, their horns are much shorter than Asmodian Mamuts. Which is odd, to say the least.</p>

          <p>Well, for such a thing to happen, Mamuts here must not need horns as much for defense. Here! In Balaurea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there are other possibilities. Disease or mutation, for example. I'd need to study those horns closer to know for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is where you come in, [%username]. If you could obtain Swamp Mamut horns for me, my work would go much more smoothly.</p>

          <p>I can't tell you how pleased I am. What I find here could be of great importance, and not just for my next paper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best place to find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_mammoth_DR_51_An]s is probably near Gelkmaros Falls.</p>

          <p>That is disappointing, but there is much in this world, and it waits for no one, Human or Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So it is with my research as well. I will be here for quite a while yet. If you have time later....</p>

          <p>I've come up with several hypotheses that could explain the Mamuts' horns.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One involves forced migration. Another raises the possibility of adaptations that make up for horn length.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, of course, they're just hypotheses without actual data. Thus my request to you.</p>

          <p>Hmm, not entirely. I go through many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_mammoth_DR_51_An] horns in my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I'm to have enough to test my hypotheses, I'll need more than this. Otherwise, I'll have to interrupt my progress to get more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, you see, it's more efficient for both of us if you were to get the required number now, all at once.</p>

          <p>Hmmm. I see several intriguing avenues for study just from a cursory visual examination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's bit of a shame to have to take the lives of such docile creatures, especially in Balaurea, but it's necessary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not much, but I hope this will go some way towards recompense.</p>

          <p>Irkale has several theories about how and why Swamp Mamuts in Balaurea differ from those in Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, none of them could be proven without actual Swamp Mamut horns for her to study. She asked you to get some for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did so, and Irkale praised your diligence and contribution towards her work.</p>
