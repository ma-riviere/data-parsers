          <p>Good choice. I've always liked that one, myself. When you're up against so many opponents, tactics become all-important. Sometimes you'll need to team up with your opponents against someone, and then you'll turn around and stab them in the back!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just keep an eye out for someone trying to do the same to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, sorry, I don't mean to put you off. Are you still interested in the Arena of Chaos?</p>

          <p>Now, I don't remember if I've been over this with you, but it's one ticket per Daeva per day. I keep a list, so I'll know if you're trying to get one over on me. Plus, you need to be skilled enough. I can't let just anyone in there, or we'll be facing more distraught family members. Can't have that happen again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait one moment while I check that you're eligible.</p>

          <p>I knew it! You know why I say all that stuff about backstabbing? It's to weed out the weak. If it puts you off, you don't need to be going into the Arena of Chaos anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should start with the Arena of Discipline, and work your way up.</p>

          <p>Here's your ticket. One per day, so don't lose it. And none of this, "I left it in my other breeches." You need to present the actual ticket at the door. We once had someone try and pass off something she'd hand-doodled on the back of a running scroll. I do have eyes in my head, you know!</p>
