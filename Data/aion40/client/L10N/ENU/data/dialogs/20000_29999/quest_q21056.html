          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a rare moment, when I, Fundin the Fearless, must ask for the help of another.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make no mistake, Fundin the Fearless cannot be defeated, but I am just one man and this is a war. Now and then it falls to other Daevas to handle lesser tasks while I, Fundin, challenge the Dragon Lords themselves!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Elyos have wrested control of our garrisons in Inggison, the Elyos commanders [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q03], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q04], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q05] pose the greatest threat. Dispatch these worrisome Elyos, and I, Fundin, will offer a generous reward.</p>

          <p>There are those who call Inggison the land of defeat, but for Fundin the Fearless, Inggison is a land ripe for conquest!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, it seems that only one as heroic as Fundin the Fearless is capable of staving off the Elyos or the Balaur for long. I issued that combat order you carry a long time ago...and none have come to claim it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What is the reward, you ask? Ever heard of Lanse's Noble Necklace? It's a rare and precious item, but it will cost a little...extra.... About 10,000,000 Kinah extra. Well, then...are the commanders dead?</p>

          <p>This is one of the most powerful relics that I, Fundin, have ever come across in my travels. 10,000,000 Kinah is a paltry price for such a magnificent item.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I took it from a colossal Balaur I'd slain. The creature must have been ten...no...twenty meters tall! With fangs like spearheads, claws like scimitars, and seven...no...seventeen heads all belching fire! It was no match for Fundin the Fearless, but I did break a sweat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Therefore, the necklace is 10,000,000 Kinah. Do you want it, or not?</p>

          <p>You have made a wise decision. Wearing relics like this, your power might one day rival that of even Fundin the Fearless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I doubt it. Greatness like mine is only achieved once in eternity.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>10,000,000 Kinah is a hefty amount, and there is no shame in not having that much to spend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, without our Daevas wielding powerful relics such as this...it will fall to Fundin the Fearless to win this war.</p>
