          <p>This wicked world is full of lies and deceit. I am a Priest because I have faith and trust in the divine. The mortal get no such consideration from me.</p>

          <p>In fact, my long search for faith has taught me how to question and doubt.</p>

          <p>Indeed it is. Not even the most gilded tongue can deceive me. I have an instinct for picking out the suspicious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You, Daeva, I think I can trust. I am actually here to monitor this village and all who live in it, especially....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, it's not necessarily suspicious in of itself, but the Reians are...resistant to my particular skills.</p>

          <p>Well, I will say that it's...off-putting to deal with people so opaque to me. They could be in league with the Balaur and I wouldn't sense it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that I'm the only one concerned, of course. Agent Mastarius at Gelkmaros Defense Base is also deeply interested in them.</p>

          <p>In fact, it's time for me to report to him. If you're heading that way, could you deliver a message?</p>

          <p>Just tell him that all is well so far, and that I'm staying vigilant. Actually, you can tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mamalia] this and she'll pass it on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But first, ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shulack_DF4_5] if anyone's left anything suspicious at the warehouse. Report what you're told there to Phina too.</p>

          <p>Gehlen is very thorough, as usual. I'm not sure if it's vigilance or paranoia on his part.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in a place like this, perhaps paranoia is the right reaction. It certainly may keep you alive here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you for bringing me his report. Here's something for your time and trouble.</p>

          <p>You reported on the situation in the village to Phina in his stead. She commended your efforts, though she wondered whether Gehlen was being too paranoid.</p>
