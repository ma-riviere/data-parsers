          <p>You were right about that strange dream, [%username]. I too experienced the same thing after touching the Fake Stigma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, ever since I have been having the same recurring nightmare. A faceless, nameless void of confusion and terror.</p>

          <p>Do you remember hearing the name "Kromede" in the dream? I don't know if you know this, but there is an infamous Daeva called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Morheim.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Kromede in this strange nightmare is the same person, that would be...something worth knowing. She is powerful, and wicked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it turns out, several others have also had the same nightmare. We should look into this together. Will you help me?</p>

          <p>Good. Then I suggest you track down Bridget, a Daeva of Psychic Arts, in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_D1_2].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She came to find out how to remove the curse of Ereshkigal from souls in the Kurngalfberg Ice City, but she may also know something of this Fake Stigma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take it with you when you go to see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Bridget]. Just warn her before she touches it.</p>

          <p>Never mind then. I will find someone else. If you don't mind being tormented by nightmares, who am I to judge?</p>

          <p>Nonsense, hand it over. Hmmmm.... So, you keep having the same nightmare, over and over, ever since you touched this? I can see why. Stigma is generally just a shard of one soul, but this item has a great many souls trapped inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A lot of this seems to be going around, curiously. Just the other day, another Daeva brought me something similar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give me some time with this. I'd like to talk with the souls found in this item to see what they have to say.</p>
