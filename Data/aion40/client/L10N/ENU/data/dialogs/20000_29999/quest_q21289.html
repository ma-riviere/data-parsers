          <p>[%username]. I trust I can rely on your discretion? There is a small matter I need to speak to you about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have received intelligence that the Elyos are attempting to enter Gelkmaros through the Silentera Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we must prepare for this eventuality, but there is no need to make this widely known. It will only start a panic.</p>

          <p>The plan is as follows: should Vorgaltem Citadel and the Crimson Temple fall to the Elyos, Agent [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_3111_Boss_Da_1] will make his stand at the Gelkmaros Defense Base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As long as he stands strong, we cannot fail. Our job is to make sure he stands strong, and I want you to lend a hand, [%username].</p>

          <p>Ah, that is good news. I already feel much greater confidence in our victory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need you to do is, when Agent [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_3111_Boss_Da_1] is under attack, to use Mastarius's Aether Concentrator.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This device allows you to transfer some of your own Aetheric power to the Agent. In a place like this, where Aether is so scarce, he needs all the help he can get.</p>

          <p>Yes, this will no doubt be a bitter battle. One who is not fully committed would be wise not to make promises they can't keep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope that further experiences lead you to reconsider. Even if you doubt your own competence, I do not, and neither does the Agent.</p>
