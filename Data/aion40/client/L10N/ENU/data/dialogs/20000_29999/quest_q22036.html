          <p>Our job now is to see that the way there is open so that when the order comes, our legions won't get caught in skirmishes on their way to the real battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to accomplish this, apparently I have to sign a bunch of paperwork and write half a dozen sit-reps a day. This is how Pandaemonium thinks wars are won. You can probaby guess my own opinions on that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got a better plan. Get down there and kill us some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanFi_Noble_60_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanSC_Noble_60_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanWi_Noble_60_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_TDown_DrakanCl_Noble_60_An]s in the Outer Ring. I want to see some enthusiasm, [%username], or else I'll promote you and you'll be forced to write reports instead.</p>

          <p>Good. Wish I could've been there to do it myself, but the worst I see these days are papercuts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess that's my lot, now, and who am I to shirk it. But it's good to know that there are Daevas out there bringing the Balaur suffering in my name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your reward. You've earned it.</p>

          <p>Trois said that the Balaur Protectorate Legions in Tiamaranta's Eye would hinder Asmodian forces when the order finally came to move on Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You thinned out the Protectorate Fighters, Searchers, Protectorate Mage, and Protectorate Healers along the Outer Ring of Tiamaranta's Eye, and Trois seemed grateful.</p>
