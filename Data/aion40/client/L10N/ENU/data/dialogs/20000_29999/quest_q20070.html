          <p>So much for Asmodian promises. You and the Elyos are as bad as each other! You said you'd cooperate, but now you're at each other's throats as much as ever. Did you really think I'd never find out?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat must be laughing at us now. All this squabbling merely plays into our enemy's hands!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, the time for the decisive battle is upon us, and I have decided that we Reians can no longer afford to trust you. We will defeat Tiamat alone.</p>
