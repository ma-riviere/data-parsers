		<p>Oh, [%username]! You snuck up on me. Your skills in stealth and silence have been improving, I see. </p>

		<p>It's good to see more [%userclass]s turning in Mithril coins. I was starting to think that our Daevas lacked conviction.</p>

		<p>I'm authorized to reward Assassins and Rangers who have dedicated themselves to the service of Asmodae. I have a broad selection of weapons and armor which I will trade for Mithril coins...but these choice pieces aren't cheap.</p>

		<p>No [%userclass] can hope to massacre their fill of Elyos, Balaur, and beasts without a powerful weapon--I have a sizable collection myself.</p>

		<p>Even still...1800 Mithril coins is no trifling amount. Make sure that a weapon is what you desire, and then hand me the coins.</p>

		<p>It's far better to avoid an attack, but sometimes being struck is inevitable.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Under those circumstances, a durable piece of chest armor is essential to soak up some of the damage, not to mention enhance our ability to strike down the attacker.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If you'd like chest armor, I'll need 1200 Mithril coins.</p>
