          <p>Gah! Just thinking about the Elyos makes me hot with rage... even worse than these sharding reports I'm responsible for!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians may believe in that peace and love nonsense, but it's pretty obvious that neither we nor the Elyos agree fully with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can take over [%dic:STR_DIC_W_ZONE_NAME_IDLDF4b_Tiamat], we'll have an upper hand against both Elyos and Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm certain that the Elyos are thinking the same. We must drive them from Tiamaranta's Eye at all costs. Don't you agree?</p>

          <p>Maybe the Reians are right about one thing--maybe there must eventually be peace between Asmodians and Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if that happens, we must rely on our destiny. Can you imagine what the Ellies would demand of us if peace came on THEIR terms?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For now, though, the war goes on. I hope the Elyos are feeling the pain.</p>

          <p>Good, good. If we keep that up, they'll be hopelessly behind by the time we and the Reians engage Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might take a little longer to win against the Balaur, but better that than Ellie takeover.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be sure Pandaemonium hears about your success.... Probably in this next report I have to write....</p>

          <p>Trois said that it was essential to beat Elyos in Tiamaranta's Eye to make sure Asmodae gained the upper hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to Tiamaranta's Eye and killed Elyos Daevas there. Trois promised to report your good work to Pandaemonium.</p>
