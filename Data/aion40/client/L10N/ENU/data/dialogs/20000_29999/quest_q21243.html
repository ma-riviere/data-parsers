          <p>This? This quartz? What does...oh.... Great Azphel...[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Raid]. It's Ragnarok! The monster that appears in those images, I mean.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the great achievement of the Naduka Biolab, a hideous freak of nature, yet possessing massive power. If it's on the loose, my colleagues must know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ducalis] near the Earthfang Gorge to be vigilant. If he sees Ragnarok, he must retreat at once!</p>

          <p>Ragnarok, eh? That's serious indeed. All of us Dramata Chasers have been briefed on this creature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's nothing you want to face alone, Daeva. We're not even sure if the Balaur truly control it anymore.</p>

          <p>At his request, you took news of Ragnarok's escape to Dramata Chaser Ducalis at the Earthfang Gorge, to warn him to evacuate should the creature appear.</p>
