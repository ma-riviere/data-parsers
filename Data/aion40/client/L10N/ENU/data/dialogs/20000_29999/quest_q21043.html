          <p>Many people think the inhabitants of Subterranea have always worshipped the Balaur, but that isn't true. Mostly, they're brainwashed Reian tribesmen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even now, there are disappearances among the surviving Reians. Without a doubt, they can be found in Subterranea.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>There isn't much to be done for them now, I'm afraid, except to kill them. But perhaps with some research, we might be able to find a cure for what ails them.</p>

          <p>These brainwashed souls carry around parchments smeared with Balaur blood, as if it's some sort of holy relic. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know if it's related to their brainwashing or not, but it's certainly important. It may even be related to the powers some of them wield.</p>

          <p>Back in my homeland, there was a rumor that Balaur blood is blue. Of course, since arriving in Gelkmaros, I've seen plenty of evidence to the contrary.</p>
