          <p>It seems our hard work is paying off. Feles has learned a lot about the Strigik in a relatively short time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, they do seem to have a civilization of sorts. Or at least, they're organized. They are led by a chieftain who appears much smarter than the others.</p>

          <p>So it seems. He has enough of a grasp of strategy and tactics to make things much more difficult for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, that makes it hard for us to take care of the problem at the root. But I don't think he can plan for you--if you're up to a little assassination.</p>

          <p>His name translates to something like "[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Owllau_Wi_NmdQ_52_Ae]" in Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But just because he plans from behind the scenes doesn't mean he's cowardly or weak. The Shedim Lords prove that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Azphel watch over you. If you succeed, it would be a huge breakthrough for us.</p>
