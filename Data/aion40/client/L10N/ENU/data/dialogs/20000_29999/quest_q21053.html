          <p>Hunting Dramata is about conviction, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I still can't believe some Asmodians don't believe in Dramata. Hah! Once the baleful creatures have caused the deaths of thousands, then they'll start believing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could have been an Archon, but hunting these monsters is far more important.</p>

          <p>When a Daeva is born, we call it ascension. When a Balaur is born, they call it "awakening." Simply put, Dramata are dragons that have failed to awaken.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Dramata are failures that nonetheless wield colossal power, and serve a greater purpose. After failing to awaken, a Dramata feels depression, angst, and sorrow for the rest of its life. It crawls into a dark place and hides from the world outside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hidden in that dark place, the Dramata does the one thing it can to feel needed--it breeds. One Dramata can hatch hundreds, or even thousands of lesser Drakan children who then protect it with their lives, and later become soldiers for the Balaur.</p>

          <p>It's hard not to feel pity for the creatures, but the Dramata must be slain if we are to win this war. They are the reason the ranks of the Balaur continue to swell, no matter how much we cull their numbers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're here on the trail of a Dramata known as Padmarashka, one of the oldest and foulest of the Dramata. However...our progress is being hindered by the creatures in the Petralith Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], if you would eliminate those creatures, we could continue the hunt for Padmarashka. I have a pair of rare boots that don't fit me. If you slay the beasts, the boots are yours.</p>
