          <p>But if they're building statues of Petraliths... then that means they actually have Petraliths to copy. Or parts of them, at least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Huh. Artistic reproductions of Petraliths... I've never seen anything decorative in their village before. If there's any kind of ornamentation, it always has some kind of sacred purpose. Then these fragments... they must be connected to the Humnaz religion. Oh--I know where to look!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], find the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_21509all]s throughout the territory. There are three. There's got to be a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4a_Giantwar] in one of them!</p>

          <p>I knew it! Right again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I took this assigment, Luanna--do you know her? She's pretty much the best archaeologist in Sarpan--warned me that the Humnaz were complicated Sapiens, a complex warrior society that took years to understand properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it looks like I figured them out pretty quickly, eh? Ha! I'll be out of here in no time! Now, to get ahold of that fragment....</p>

          <p>Tanitia said that the fragments were just parts of an ordinary stone statue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She insisted that you went to Humnaz Village again to search for something related to the Petralith. You went to the village, and found a giant Petralith Fragment at the altar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you came back to Tanitia and told her what you saw, again she said that she knew it. She seems to take a lot to like.</p>
