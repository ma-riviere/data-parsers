          <p>Now that I have the fish, I need to get samples from Cellatu and Alitaurs. They don't look any different from the ones in Asmodae, but I suppose Ightris knows best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mmm, Ightris.... From her letters, she sounds very petite and demure. Wonder if she has long flowing black hair and smooth soft....</p>

          <p>Wha...? Oh. Ahem. Yes, right, the Cellatu and Alitaur samples!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She asked me to get them as well, but I haven't had time to get away from my post like I did with the fish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I...she needs several samples. Think you could do another favor for me?</p>

          <p>Hey, sorry if I've been a little short. Grauzer's been riding everyone hard lately. Between his ranting and the stress of suspense.... I think everyone's on edge right now.</p>

          <p>I don't need her nagging me. Grauzer's quite enough, thanks. Come on back when you have more Thorny Cellatu and Brokenhorn Alitaur samples.</p>

          <p>Sheesh, these things are more disgusting than I thought. But once I pack them with the fish, it'll be Ightris's to deal with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But how do I get them to her without leaving my post? Could you.... Just kidding! I need to return to the fortress soon anyway.</p>

          <p>You hunted Thorny Cellatus, Baby Thorny Cellatus, and Brokenhorn Alitaurs, and brought the samples back to Lucal, who actually showed some gratitude.</p>
