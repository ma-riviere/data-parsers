          <p>Hahaha, that's nonsense, [%username]. This stone has become my favorite possession. I could never get rid of it. It's mine...my own...my....</p>

          <p>...was...was I about to attack you, [%username]? I can't remember... My head is all fuzzy. I just want to finish my survey and get back to Pandaemonium. But first I need Concentrated Antimoni Ore, which can be found on the Pucas and Caltrops near here. Can you lend me a hand?</p>

          <p>Hunt the creatures, and take the Concentrated Antimoni. After I have that...I should be able to leave the Sunken Canyon. I need a vacation...perhaps a nice lake...underground... Yessss....</p>
