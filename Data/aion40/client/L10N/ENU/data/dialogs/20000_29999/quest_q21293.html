          <p>Lord Marchutan must have guided you to me, [%username]. I've just had some very important news, and I need a reliable Daeva to follow up on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I sent an Archon to investigate the reported Dramata activity in Gelkmaros, and to locate their lair if possible. Kimin just sent word that he has a new lead.</p>

          <p>Very. I am concerned that the Dramata may have already spawned, and if we don't destroy them before they hatch, we might have a Drakan invasion on our hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to find Kimin and get more details from him. He's waiting outside the Dramata's lair in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C6].</p>

          <p>Good! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kimin] may be newer at this than our expert Dramata Chasers, but he has already proven himself adept at uncovering information. I have no doubt that he can advise you on what you'll be walking into, and the best tactics to use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dramata are indeed a fearsome enemy, [%username], but you follow a special fate. Lord Marchutan's hand will guide you in this venture, I am sure of it.</p>

          <p>The Dramata are indeed a fearsome enemy. I thought that you were the one to lead us out of this pass, but I must have interpreted the signs wrongly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please reconsider. No matter how strong this Dramata may be, it still failed to ascend as a Dragon Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you doubt your skills, perhaps a few rounds in one of the Crucibles would help bolster your confidence.</p>

          <p>Who are you supposed to be? My backup? Agent Richelle must be going soft in her old age. I found this cave, I identified the Dramata threat, and I won't share my glory with some rank amateur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those Dramata Chasers have been twiddling their thumbs for months now, and I located Padmarashka in a snap! You will not mess this up for me, you hear me?</p>

          <p>[%username]? That [%userclass] who used to work with that dubiously legal raider group? Yeah, I know who you are. Some of us had to work for our successes. We didn't just get some prophecy handed to us on a plate. Agent Richelle might fawn over you for that, but you don't fool me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to do her bidding--for now--so I suppose I'll hand over this key. It gets you past the magical ward that seals the entrance to the cave. But I'm watching you.</p>
