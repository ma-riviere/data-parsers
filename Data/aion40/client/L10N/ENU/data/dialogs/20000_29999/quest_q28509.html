          <p>Psst! Daeva! You interested in secrets and mysteries? Then Moofrenerk has a big one for you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Down hall and down long ramp is Haramel Tower. Is supposed to be used for storage and transport, but on top...!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is tightly locked chest! Very mysterious! Moofrenerk is dying of curiosity!</p>

          <p>Ah! Moofrenerk sees Gestanerk creep in when he thinks no one else is around, then put papers inside. He acts very secretive, very nervous!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is it Gestanerk's secrets, or someone else's? Either way, might be worth much Kinah! Even if not, must know! Shugos must always know secrets!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One thing is sure: Gestanerk very paranoid about chest. Seems to have taken many precautions, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Like giving key to Keymaster MuMu Dang for safekeeping! Then there is rust...but that is not deliberate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is leak in ceiling over tower. Made lock very rusty. How do I know this? It is...NOT because I tried to pick lock, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So to open box, need Lubricating Oil so key will work on lock. Oh, and box is on storage platform high up in tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moofrenerk wants papers, but Daeva can have anything you find in box. Good deal, yes yes?</p>

          <p>Good, good! Remember, though [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_04_RatmanMWa_Key_18_an] has key, must get three Lubricating Oils from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_04_RatmanMWa_Num_18_an]s for it to work!</p>

          <p>Oh, you must also take [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Elevator_Lever] to get to storage platform where box is.</p>

          <p>Hmmm. Moofrenerk might get in trouble if Gestanerk catches me with papers. When get papers, take them to Vuet at Altgard Fortress. He will tell me what they are!</p>

          <p>This is... a really bad Elyos-Asmodian romance! Why would Gestanerk lock this up? Unless...maybe it has some kind of hidden code inside?</p>

          <p>Hmmm. I'd have to examine it more closely to be sure. Wish there were more samples.... But still! Thank you for delivery. Now take your reward and let me get back to this!</p>

          <p>Moofrenerk wants to know what's in the rusted box in Haramel Tower. At his request, you obtained the key to the box, and the oil needed to make it work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Again at Moofrenerk's request, you took the papers inside to Vuet, who found it was a cheesy romance story. However, he thought it might still be important, and rewarded you anyway.</p>
