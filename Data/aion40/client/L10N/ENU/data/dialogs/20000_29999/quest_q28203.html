          <p>I definitely think you're ready to progress in the Empyrean Crucible.</p>

          <p>Well, don't let that modesty keep you from accomplishing what you're capable of. It'd be a disservice to all of us.</p>

          <p>The next challenge is defeating Stage 7. But I have to warn you, the difficulty increases greatly.</p>

         <p>Good. But don't expect the usual in Stage 7. Your opponents will be...</p>

          <p>Actually, I'll let you find out for yourself. Let's just say they're...the best at what they do.</p>
