          <p>My armor is...soaking wet? What? You must be imagining things, [%username]. I suppose it could be all the blood, sweat, and tears I poured into taking the Altar of Avarice. Yes...that's it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> It was a hard fought battle. We were surrounded on all fronts, our enemies were closing in, hope was lost, and then...Fundin the Fearless appeared!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In one fell swoop, he shattered the enemy's defenses, and slaughtered dozens as he raged across the battlefield. Yes! It was glorious, and afterward, he was approached by fair Shaenna, who offered him a kiss in thanks. I'm so amazing.</p>

          <p>Nonsense, [%username]! You just have not yet witnessed the fury of Fundin the Fearless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway...now that I've conquered the Altar of Avarice, it's time to shore up its defenses. This is the staging point for the invasion into Ingisson, and soon the Elyos will witness the fury of Fundin the Fearless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eradicating the pitiful [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C2_WaterWorm_55_An]s nearby is too simple a task for someone as powerful as I, so I'll let you have the honor. What do you say, [%username]?</p>

          <p>This is a task suited for one of your skill, [%username]. You may be Asmodae's rising star, but you will never be Fundin the Fearless!</p>

          <p>I mean, [%username] the Fearless? That just doesn't have the same ring to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now, and slay the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C2_WaterWorm_55_An]s in the area. Oh, and uh...bring me their salivary glands...and make sure not to spill any of the liquid inside.</p>

          <p>Shards! I missed! Oh, er... Please ignore what just happened. I was just mad at Danton for something that happened earlier. I can assure you that we are not using these Waterworm glands as water balloons. That would be ignorant and dangerous.</p>
