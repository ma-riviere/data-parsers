          <p>Excuse me, young Daeva, but I was wondering if you could do a favor for a feeble old man.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am Shawster, and I must reach Rhonnam Refugee Village, but I'm afraid my legs just won't take me there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is someone there I need to talk to urgently.</p>

          <p>Have you heard of the famed detective Shorleck? I've heard he is there, and I must consult with him. You see...my wife has disappeared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last evening, she wanted to go for a walk outside the fortress. I told her it was dangerous, but she insisted she was tired of being cooped up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I accompanied her. I may be old, but any escort is better than none. We'd crossed the bridge in front of the fortress when...when....</p>

          <p>Thank you. We just settled down for a small lunch when I had to, er, answer nature's call. I was gone for only a minute, I swear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I returned, Iliene had vanished! There were signs of a struggle, and red stains I thought might be blood...her...blood....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last night, I remembered hearing of Shorleck, but I can't see him myself. I have an artificial leg, you see, and walking is tiring. I beg of you....</p>

          <p>Aion bless you! Tell him that...oh! That reminds me. Someone else is missing: my assistant, Maron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a talented, diligent young alchemist. Though he didn't get along with Iliene...despite being close in age, I guess they really don't have anything in common.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was supposed to have returned from herb gathering yesterday. I thought he was just delayed, but now I wonder if it's connected somehow. Tell Detective [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sherockian] all this, and soon. I am counting on you.</p>

          <p>Greetings. You have been to Altgard, I perceive. You were once a member of Ulgorn's Raiders, and arrived in Gelkmaros only relatively recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, we have never met. Nor did I know anything about you until this moment. I am a detective, you see.</p>

          <p>But no. It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. Tell Shawster I will accept his case.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ask him two questions: Where exactly he last saw his wife, and whether any items have gone missing. I trust you don't mind?</p>
