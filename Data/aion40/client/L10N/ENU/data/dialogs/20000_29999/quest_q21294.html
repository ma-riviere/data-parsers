          <p>I almost hesitate to send you into the cave, because if you try and fail, it might cause the Drakan to ramp up their security, and we won't get another chance. But Richelle has this thing about you because of the big prophecy and all, so I know you're all I'm going to get. Just don't mess this up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is my big chance, [%username]. If you can get that Dramata based on my intel, it will make my career. I hate having to put that in your hands, but here we are.</p>

          <p>I'm intelligence, not muscle. This is what we have meatheads like you for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and you're going to need a League for this. You may have a prophecy on your side, but that's not going to be enough to take down a Dramata.</p>

          <p>You're going to need all my intel if you want to pull this off, so listen up. The Dramata inside the cave is called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dramata_57_Al]. It has already spawned, and is trying to incubate its eggs. Time is ticking, and it's only a matter of days before they hatch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When that happens, Drakan will come pouring out of that cave. Our foothold in Balaurea might be threatened! You might not think that a newly hatched Drakan would be much of a threat, but believe you me they come out in fine fighting form.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, hurry and get your League together. You don't need to finish off all the spawn, just take down the Dramata. They'll never hatch without it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Or maybe enough people have seen through you that you can't get enough for a full League. Well, better that you shouldn't even try, so you can't mess this up. Maybe now we have a chance of getting it right. Maybe now Agent Richelle will stop looking at you as the answer to everything.</p>

          <p>[%username]? I heard a lot of unpleasant noises from inside the cave. You could hardly call them the sounds of battle. I must admit, I'm a little surprised to see you again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you actually destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dramata_57_Al], or is this you coming back to tell me you only escaped with your miserable hide?</p>

          <p>Yes, well. Are you sure it was dead? Balaur regeneration is legendary, and the Dramata are known for coming back from their apparent death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Agent Richelle assigned this reward to the Daeva who managed to defeat Padmarashka, but if you take it on false grounds, you'll have to answer to her, not me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, if you do turn out to be telling the truth, maybe I can get that promotion I should have been up for months ago...</p>

          <p>Kimin told you that Dramata Padmarashka had laid its spawn, and you must destroy the Dramata before it could incubate its Drakan spawn to hatching.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Kimin was dubious that you could achieve the results he wanted, you and your League came through and more than earned the reward Agent Richelle had assigned for this task.</p>
