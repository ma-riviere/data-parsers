		<p>Ah, [%username]! Come to trade in some Mithril coins?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I don't see enough Sorcerers and Spiritmasters trading in coins these days.... Too many weak willed Daevas who aren't eager to risk their lives on the front lines.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I've prepared weapons, robes, pants, and other armor pieces as rewards for those who have remained diligent and courageous.</p>

		<p>Looking for a new weapon, [%username]?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>An excellent choice--saving those 1800 coins shows dedication that many Daevas lack. Even some of the most renowned amongst us don't have that kind of devotion.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>The exchange is final, so please, take a moment to consider your options. When you've decided, give me the 1,800 coins.</p>

		<p>I've always considered robes to be the most important piece of armor a Sorcerer or Spiritmaster can own.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>After all, our robes are how we are most often identified in combat. If our robes appear tattered, enemies will be more likely to focus their attention on us. But if they are majestic, our enemies will flee in terror.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>You've made the right decision. Now, please allow me to count those 1200 coins.</p>

		<p>What Sorcerer or Spiritmaster can weave their most potent spells in uncomfortable pants? I certainly can't, [%username].</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>A pair of comfy pants is essential for combat, especially in situations where extended combat is required. We can't just stop to adjust our waistline in the heat of battle, after all.</p>

		<p>This is a great idea, [%username]. Now, show me those 900 coins.</p>

    <p>It's important to drape our entire bodies with the finest armor available, both for protection and to augment our spells and abilities. </p>

		<p>You're looking for shoulder armor, gloves, or shoes I see. Each piece will cost 600 Mithril coins.</p>

		<p>Regardless of which piece you choose, I am sure that it will be a solid investment. Think carefully, and tell me what you've decided on when you are ready.</p>
