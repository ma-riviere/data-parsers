	<p>You do? Ha! These things are almost crushed beyond recognition! I'm half tempted to see how well these fly. If anything, I might bend them back into something resembling shape.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Ah, I can't do that. Here's your reward.</p>

	<p>So you do! Ancient Crowns are useful, apparently. Personally, I can't see why, but if it keeps our researchers in Pandaemonium happy, then I'm all in.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Here's your reward, [%username]. Use it well.</p>

	<p>You do! Excellent, pass them here then, and be careful will you? The last Daeva who handed me a Greater Ancient Crown dropped it in front of me, and suddenly it was a Lesser Ancient Crown. Magic, eh?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Yes, yes. These are excellent. Good work, [%username]. Your reward is right here!</p>

	<p>You do?! Let me see!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Oof! You weren't lying! These are perfect--the researchers in Pandaemonium will be more excited than an Elyos with an olive branch.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Treasures like these warrant a substantial reward, [%username]. Use it well.</p>

    <p>We need ten of each item, and all have to be the same quality. Bring them to me and I'll reward you with Abyss Points which you can use to purchase armor and weapons.</p>
