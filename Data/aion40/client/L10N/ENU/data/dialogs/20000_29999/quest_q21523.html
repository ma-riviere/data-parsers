          <p>Excuse me, [%userclass]. Could you do me a favor if you're not too busy?</p>

          <p>Please ask Warehouse Keeper [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vort] where the Brilliant Magical Aether I asked for is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I requested it three days ago to repair the ship engine, but I still don't have it. Can you ask while I tend to my work?</p>

          <p>The Brilliant Magical Aether? I sent it from Pandaemonium by messenger two days ago. You mean it hasn't arrived?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My messenger hasn't been seen lately either. Oh, dear... something terrible must have happened to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that this answer helps Riger... but ask Trade Broker [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LDF4a_08] if she can help. And give Riger my apologies.</p>

          <p>Brilliant Magical Aether? Oooh, that very valuable, very high demand. Berinerk not seen for very long time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better to look in Pandaemonium. Not much chance of showing up here.</p>

          <p>That is unfortunate. I wonder what happened to the messenger. Did he fall prey to monsters? The Balaur? Or someone else?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll contact Pandaemonium--both to report this incident and to get Brilliant Magical Aether.</p>

          <p>You did what you could, so you've earned the reward. Please take it.</p>

          <p>Riger asked you to find out why he hasn't gotten the Brilliant Magical Aether needed to repair the ship from the warehouse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You learned from Vord that the messenger sent with the item had vanished. You tried the Trade Broker but without success.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Riger was chagrined, but he decided to contact Pandaemonium both to report the messenger's disappearance and to get another Brilliant Magical Aether.</p>
