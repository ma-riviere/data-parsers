          <p>Ugh. Have you ever been attacked by angry bees? It happens to me all the time.</p>

          <p>No matter where I go, what I wear, or how careful I am.... BAM! [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Bee_DR_51_An] come out of nowhere!</p>

          <p>And they're everywhere! Every time Danomdel and I go on patrol, they're there! And, of course, they only go after me.</p>

          <p>It's just not a few bees, either--it's always huge blasted swarms! It's like they hate me or something.</p>

          <p>Danomdel says the same thing! But he's not the one who has to deal with the blasted things constantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know why this is happening. It's my fate--I'm cursed with balfired luck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But maybe your presence is a sign it's improving. Could you kill some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Bee_DR_51_An] for my sake?</p>

          <p>I'd ask Danomdel, but we're always too busy. Besides, he just says "take a bath once in a while and you'll be fine!" As if it were that simple!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful, though--with swarms that big, those bees can cause as much pain as a Balaur.</p>
