          <p>We may be at war for our very world, but we still need rest and relaxation. Without it, we'll all burn out and become useless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why Pernon was founded: to give all Asmodians, especially Daevas, a sanctuary, a haven where they can be themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Doman] can teleport you there. Information Officer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Harretion] is waiting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He can tell you whatever you want to know about Pernon. If you're interested in having your own home, you should see him.</p>

          <p>Ah, how are you enjoying Pernon so far? As you can see, there's much to do even for those who don't own a home here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can visit others' houses, shop, craft, or just relax--get away from the horrors of war for a brief moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, of course, this is a place for Daevas to mingle--Daevas from all the corners of Asmodae who might otherwise never meet.</p>

          <p>Oh, it is! Did you know that Pernon is divided up into many different villages, each with its unique setting and style?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, owning a home takes Kinah and dedication, so it's not for everyone. You should consider it carefully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, the rewards are well worth it, and even if you don't, Pernon has a lot to offer. Like this free gift just for visiting.</p>

          <p>You teleported to Pernon, and talked with Hariton, who gave you a run-down of what Pernon was all about.</p>
