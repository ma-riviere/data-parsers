          <p>Whew! Sweaty work, this is. But I'm happy to do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No place better to be a smith, if you ask me. Daevas of Fire and Ice all over, so there's no need to worry about fire or water to cool off the iron. Nothing but top-quality work since I got here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hey, are you [%username]? The one involved with Kromede's Trial? I've heard stories, bits and pieces, and I'm intrigued. Can you tell me more about it?</p>

          <p>Just as I expected! Now I can finally get Dream Fragments!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me explain--Dream Fragments are something that blacksmiths like me consider legendary. They can change properties and shape according to the maker's will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's said that they were easy to come by when Aion first created Atreia, but during the cataclysm they were all lost. But if what you saw is correct, the creatures there must have Dream Fragments!</p>

          <p>How about this deal--you go back inside Kromede's Trial and get me my Dream Fragments, and in exchange I'll make you something that suits you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I get what I want, you get what you want. It's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Great! From what you told me, there are many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCromede_2up_Mguard2_38_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCromede_2up_Rguard2_38_An]s in this nightmare, so it's no walk in the dark. Just bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_18607a]s that they sit upon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is so exciting! You should get going immediately. While you're out, I'll be making something special for you. You'll love it, I'm sure!</p>

          <p> </p>
