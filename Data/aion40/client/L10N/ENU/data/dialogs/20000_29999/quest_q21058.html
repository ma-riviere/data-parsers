          <p>Aion forsaken, thick skulled, tail chasing, egg sucking cowards! Blast these infernal Elyos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos commanders [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q03], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q04], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q05] take over our garrison in Inggison, and then hide inside issuing orders! The wretches won't even leave the safety of the garrison to defend their own troops!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't care what it takes. I'll put my entire salary at stake and offer a reward to any Daeva who can slaughter those worms!</p>

          <p>Blech! I'll never get over the taste of Balaur blood. The curs sure do like to bleed. I can't even take off a limb without getting blood in my mouth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], what's that combat order you carry? I can hardly remember writing that...after a long night of drinking alone and seething in anger, I'd guess.... Wait, does this mean...you killed the Elyos commanders?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you did, I have a Turquoise Ring or a Corundum Ring to offer as a reward. I spent a fortune on these a long time ago, but now I'm so poor that I can't offer them for free. I'll need to ask for 20,000,000 Kinah. What do you say?</p>

          <p>I know it's a lot, [%username]. To tell the truth, I thought my brother Krizarid would have made me eat that order and come to collect on it himself a long time ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I figured I'd just be selling these rings back to the merchant I bought them from, since Krizarid would have no use for them. But our operations in Gelkmaros are keeping my brother preoccupied....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You, on the other hand, look like you could make use of these. The price isn't cheap, but the rings are well worth it. What do you say?</p>

          <p>I'll be glad to see one of these rings find a master. I feel bad keeping them in a lockbox when they could be helping us conquer Inggison.</p>
