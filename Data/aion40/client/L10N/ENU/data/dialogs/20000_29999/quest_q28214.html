          <p>What? That? Hah, that was barely a warm-up! I'll explain the next one, but I'm getting tired of repeating myself, so listen carefully this time.</p>

          <p>See [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Reigar] for a ticket, and choose which arena you are more comfortable in. Then get out of my way until you've proven yourself. I'm expecting a contingent of rather more... impressive Daevas, who I intend to oversee in the Arena of Chaos, and I don't want you to still be cluttering up the place when they arrive.</p>

          <p>Perhaps with this incentive, you'll keep competing and improve your skills. To think, we have to bribe Daevas if we want an army fit to fight Tiamat! I never would have thought.</p>
