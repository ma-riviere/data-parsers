          <p>He is making sure that you and all the other Daevas who participated in Gelkmaros's defense are recognized by Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>Lord Marchutan will be even more pleased, I'm sure! This could be the key to conquering Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must fight the Guardian Generals of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the heart of enemy territory, but that makes establishing our presence all the more important. Good hunting.</p>
