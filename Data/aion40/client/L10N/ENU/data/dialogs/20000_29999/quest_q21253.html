          <p>About the Piece of Zikel.... It takes special skills to enhance the Spellbook I gave you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just like raw gold--which is considered precious, but whose value alters when wrought into Kinah coins--so it is with the Piece of Zikel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, I know of one who can help you with this.</p>

          <p>Her name is Usener. She works out of Pandaemonium. Perhaps you've met her before?</p>

          <p>That would be my recommendation. Unfortunately, this work is so exacting that I doubt she'll help you for free.</p>

          <p>A wise decision. You should at least hear what she has to say.</p>

          <p>Fate guides us, but we can't let it do all the work. Be sure to give Usener my regards.</p>

          <p>Really? I'd suggest you at least hear her out.</p>

          <p>Perhaps you are confident enough in the power of Athana's Spellbook. Flattering, but there's always room for improvement.</p>

          <p>If it's the Kinah consideration, then I suggest reconsidering as soon as you can afford it.</p>

          <p>Now, I usually wouldn't work with books, but this is a special one. I have a few tricks for this one.</p>

          <p>Sorry. Without that Kinah, I can't get the materials. No materials, no enhancing of Athana's Spellbook. Oh, and remember, you can't have it equipped when you come to me--it has to be in your Cube!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't get me wrong--I KNOW it's a lot of money. But quality costs, not to mention the labor...</p>

          <p>That was a great workout for my skills. Thank you so much for bringing this to me. May this Spellbook devastate your enemies!</p>
