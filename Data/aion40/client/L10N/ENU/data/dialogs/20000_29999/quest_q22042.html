          <p>[%userclass], here. The Reians have a special request they wish to make of us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They need to heat steel to an extremely high temperature. We're not sure why, but we know what they need: White Charcoal from the Flame Dragrints.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our relationship with the Reians is comfortable at the moment, but could do with a little nudge in the right direction. Helping them get their charcoal would be a solid first step. Will you help?</p>

          <p>Yeah, this is the stuff. Good work, [%username].</p>

          <p>I'll make sure credit's given where it's due. The Reians will soon know that our blood is strong and reliable, unlike the watery drips the sunburnt cowards sneeze out.</p>

          <p>Lineta told you that the Reians had sent a special request for white charcoal, an extremely rare substance that naturally forms inside Flame Dragrints. You were asked to help, and gathered the charcoal in good time.</p>
