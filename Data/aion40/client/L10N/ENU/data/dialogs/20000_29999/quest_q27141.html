          <p>Today's task: it's time to get some more services in town! Collect [%dic:STR_DIC_E_junk_town_upgrade_flower_soul]s and take them to the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Town_d_SZTown_d_C5]. We'll use the essences to entice Goblets and Crowns Reward officers to our village!</p>

          <p>Heard about latest initiative, Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Always good to get more faces into village, yes yes? Especially when faces can be used to earn Abyss Points! Earn AP from comfort of own village, hmm? Akakak...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, does Daeva have essences for me? Must make invitation as enticing as possible to make sure Reward Officers come to village!</p>

          <p>Perfect!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Flower Essences so... perfect, Daeva! Always a mystery why Reward Officer would be interested in them, but I suppose no one can spend whole day staring at old metal, hmm?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will get started on invitations soon. Thanks, Daeva!</p>
