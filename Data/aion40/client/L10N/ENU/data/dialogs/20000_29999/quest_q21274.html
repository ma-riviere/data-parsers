          <p> </p>
          <p>There's just so many times you can watch the Balaur passing by, y'know? They're tres gross and all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hey, as long as you're here, you could, like, do me a favor! Do you know what Old Weathered Seals are?</p>

          <p>Really? Duh! I thought everyone knew about 'em! They're, like totally old items that can manipulate the wind and junk, if you have enough of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So they're used a lot here in Balaurea, 'cuz there's no Aether, right? Only some are too weak, but they look totally cool, so they're collectible! My friend Resma and I collect them! Did I mention that already?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I want to get my collection as big as possible, but I've gotta stay here and work, which is a total bummer. So could you get some Old Weathered Seals for me? I'd pay you!</p>

          <p>Okay, so you gotta go to places that you can only get to with a windstream or a Geyser. Yeah, like here! Fer sure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll see monsters or plants with [%dic:STR_DIC_E_air_collection_treasure01]s under 'em. Or maybe they'll be in some kinda box.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, just get me 88 seals, and you can totally have this ring I'm not wearing anymore. Good deal, right?</p>
