          <p>Ah, [%username]. I wanted to talk to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What have you made of the Reians so far? Have you looked around [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP] much? I was escorted through the city just a short while ago. They don't trust us, though I can't say I blame them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was one other thing. Kahrun's message...</p>

          <p>I think... I think his ideas are sound. Humiliating as it may be, working with our enemies may be the only way to ensure our blood lives on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to meet Elder [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raffaele] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP_07]. He has asked for a competent Asmodian to help the Reian people, and there's no one I would sooner trust than you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now remember, a great deal is at stake here. Blood for blood, soldier!</p>

          <p>Asmodian, you are not the only people besieged by war. We Reians face countless threats with each passing day. We fight Strigiks, the Calydon, the Balaur, Shulacks, Jotun, Sand Bugs, and many more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, we face a stark test now from another group. An insect race that I believe you know well.</p>

          <p>I understand that Aimah sent you here to work for us. I want you to defeat the Klaw threat for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will need to travel to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1_02] and meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eroos]. He will be able to tell you more about the Klaw headcount and strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are half as powerful as the rumors suggest you are, dealing with the Klaw threat should be easy enough, no?</p>

          <p>You're it? You're the help Rafael sent? Does he not realize the size of the task at hand?! Ugh. Well, I'll send you on your way, and when you die, maybe I'll get some actual help, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen. The Klaws of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_OP_21] have been interfering in our business. Worse, they've started attacking us here. We asked the Asmodians for a group of Daevas to enter the cave and wipe them out. If you're all they're sending... well, it seems you have enemies in high places.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to the south of the Refugee Camp and you'll find a path leading deep inside the cave. Go now, so we can get actual help before it's too late.</p>

          <p>Well... this is surprising. It seems that the Asmodians have steel in their souls after all. I'll report this to Kahrun right away.</p>

          <p>You were sent to Rafael to prove the level of Asmodian convictions. He assigned you a task: to kill off the Klaw inside a nearby cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did as Rafael asked and returned alive, much to his surprise. He praised your prompt work, suggesting greater interaction with the Asmodian people may yet be possible.</p>
