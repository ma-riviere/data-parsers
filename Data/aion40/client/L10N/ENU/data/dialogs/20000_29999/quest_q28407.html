          <p>Relyt said the sword hilt you found belonged to a Balaur overseer's weapon, gifted by Dragon Lord Tiamat. He wondered why and how the sword had been sundered, and sent you to the Esoterrace to uncover a clue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At the Esoterrace, you discovered the Storage Sphere of Surama, which you brought back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Relyt suggested going to Luigir, the expert on all thing Balaur and bizarre. She was thrilled by the sabotage potential of Surama's memory and told you to wait while she did...something...with it.</p>
