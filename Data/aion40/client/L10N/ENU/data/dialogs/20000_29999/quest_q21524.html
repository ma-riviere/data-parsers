          <p>Those sun-poxed Elyos are trying to curry favor with the Reians. With their arrogance and lack of subtlety, there's no way they will succeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it wouldn't hurt to remind the Reians--and the Elyos--what Asmodian claws are made of, just to head off any possible backroom alliance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's how: go to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41189_publicall] and wait for the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Dredgion]. Kill an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11525a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That will be a nice public demonstration that will also hold back Balaur efforts in the area.</p>

          <p>The Reians are smarter than the Elyos give them credit for, especially Kahrun. I've no doubt that he sees through their lies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, can't be too careful where the Feeblies are concerned. How did the assassination go?</p>

          <p>Good. Hopefully, this'll make the Elyos think twice about puffing themselves up to gain favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This ban on warfare chafes at me, but what can we do? We'll save our strength for when we need it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is for your service to Asmodae. We may not be able to fight the Elyos, but we will still defeat them!</p>

          <p>Fatebound Legion Centurion Tepes told you of Elyos plotting to curry favor with the Reians, and suggested a way to combat it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As requested, you went to a Dredgion Infiltration Zone and killed a Zorshiv Dredgion commander. You returned to great praise and a reward.</p>
