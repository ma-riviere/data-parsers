          <p>Don't worry, Daeva. I have not called you here to rebuke you. It seems that it was not our destiny to possess Siel's Relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, it's too late for recriminations. We must consider the consequences of what [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel] has done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll admit, even with all he's done in the past, the depths of his treachery took us by surprise.</p>

          <p>We can do nothing about the past, of course. But we can consider Israphel's legacy, and how it reflects upon all Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this became common knowledge, many people would lose respect for them, wondering whether they might turn against us as Israphel did. You and I know better, but lesser minds are weak and suspicious. It is our job to shield them from this terrible truth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have here a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10073a] binding you to utmost secrecy. I have the authority to command you to sign it, but I know I won't have to do that.</p>

         <p>Well, we can't undo what has been done, but we must make sure that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun] abides by this same [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_20073c] that I had you sign. The rumor must stop here.</p>
         <p> </p>

          <p>Fine, give me the letter. If it means getting rid of you Asmodians, I'll sign it. Now get out of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_sarpan_main]! This is Reian land, built with our own hands, and Pandaemonium has no business here!</p>

	        <p>Well, I hadn't exactly planned to tell the town crier of the depths of Israphel's treachery, so you can tell  [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Agehia] that she doesn't need to worry that I'll talk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, I was thinking about kicking all you Asmodians out of Sarpan, but I thought about what you'd done as a member of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel], and I reconsidered. Still, this is the end of our alliance, you understand?</p>
         	<p> </p>
          <p>Now, leave the letter with me. I'll read it over and send it to Agehia.</p>

          <p>Anyway, we can't let it happen. You may have defeated [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA52], but she was the lowliest of the Dragon Lords. Our enemy will come back strong, soon enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think there's any hope of returning to the old alliance, but we can at least try and convince Kahrun to let you stay.</p>

          <p>I bet if you rid him of some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q10073a] of certain groups in Tiamaranta, he would remember all that you've done for the Reians, and that his anger is really about Pandaemonium, not you.</p>
