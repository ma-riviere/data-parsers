          <p>Hello there, [%username]! Has it been a while since I saw you, or is it just because I'm so busy these days? Either way, I have some news that might interest you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've heard of the Empyrean Crucible and the Crucible Challenge, right? Well, Lord Marchutan has opened a whole new Crucible to test the skills of every Daeva: the Crucible Coliseum.</p>

          <p>Coliseum! It's a place for battling other Daevas. You see, the Empyrean Crucible taught you to work together with your comrades, the Crucible Challenge taught you to use your own wits. Now, there's the Crucible Coliseum--a test of your raw survival skills!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to tell you all about it, but the new Instructor can probably explain it better. Why don't you go and see him?</p>

          <p>Great! His name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shinin]. You see him over there near the doorway? Yeah, you can't miss him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you'll excuse me if I don't escort you over there. He's a bit... um... well. You'll see.</p>

          <p>Did I put you off? I mean, sure, the Coliseum is a challenge, but, you know, a fun challenge! Plus, you can see your skills improving all the time, so that's a good incentive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, if you change your mind, go and see Shinin, and he'll tell you all about it.</p>

          <p>You think you're ready for the Crucible Coliseum, do you? Most Daevas like you go striding in, but come crawling out. If that doesn't scare you off, we might be able to make something of you after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are several arenas in the Crucible Coliseum: the Discipline, Chaos, Harmony, and Glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each arena has its own rules, so I'll start with the rules of the Arena of Discipline. Now listen up, because you'll need to know this soon enough!</p>

          <p>I'd give you some advice, but really, it all boils down to: watch yourself. Your opponents will be among the toughest you've faced, if we're doing our job correctly. I don't want to let some fledgling in and end up with my superiors coming down on me for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I'm saying is, if you think you're not ready, don't go in. And if you need the rules explained again, ask. I'd rather repeat my speech than repeat the... incident.</p>
