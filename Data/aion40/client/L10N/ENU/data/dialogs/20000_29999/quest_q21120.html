          <p>What is your impression of Gelkmaros Defense Base?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, don't sugar-coat it. I know it's not in the best shape. We have so many concerns it's hard to do basic maintenance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such neglect could come back to bite us, so we're trying to keep up. But those blasted Balaur.... With their attacks, we never have time.</p>

          <p>Oh, there's definitely something you can do! I want you to buy us time so we can make much needed repairs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most Balaur that attack here come from the Marayas Wilds. Occupy them there, and we can get to work.</p>

          <p>Excellent! I suggest you start with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanWi_Re_53_An]s. They guard the Drana Growing Devices, so their loss will make the Balaur the most vulnerable to future attacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck, [%username]. For Asmodae!</p>

          <p>You're back just in time. We just finished up our most needed repairs, aAnd not a peep from the Balaur in all that time! You must have really pulled their horns.</p>

          <p>Interesting.... Very interesting. I'll have to tell my superiors about some of this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it sounds like you did them real injury. We should more than catch up on repairs before they're able to attack again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll be pressing the advantage you gave us soon. Asmodae thanks you for your labors.</p>

          <p>Aquila complained that due to constant Balaur attack, it was hard to keep Gelkmaros Defense Base in shape. She hoped that an attack on them would give some breathing room.</p>

          <p>You went to the Marayas Wilds and defeated Balaur guarding Drana Growing Devices. Upon your return, Aquila praised your work, saying you had turned the advantage back to Asmodae.</p>
