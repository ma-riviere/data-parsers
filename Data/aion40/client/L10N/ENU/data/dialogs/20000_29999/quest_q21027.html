          <p>Ah, [%username]! Perfect! Look, I have a favor to ask, but you can't tell Varca.</p>

          <p>There are supposed to be three of us guarding Feles--me, Varca, and Kantele. Varca thinks Kantele is on patrol, but....</p>

          <p>A big one. Kantele went to the Strigik Village to "clear it out" for research. Only she hasn't come back!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's just like her to go running off alone. I tried to stop her, but once her mind's made up, that's it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know if she's still out there or if the Strigik did something to her.... Please, find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kantele] before Varca realizes something's wrong.</p>
