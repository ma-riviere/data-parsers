          <p>Hold up there! I have to tell you something about Kromede's Tear!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a pretty necklace, and very useful, but the materials I made it with give it even more purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It actually has a special connection with none other than Kromede!</p>

          <p>Well, if you obtain a weapon known as the Greatsword of the Judge, it can be fused with Kromede's Tear to increase its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you have Kromede's Tear already, you'd only need to get the Greatsword of the Judge. Interested?</p>

          <p>Excellent! I'm looking forward to this. The process is really complicated, but I know I can perform it flawlessly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the Greatsword of the Judge, well, as you'd expect from the name, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] has it. Yes, the real Kromede.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's hiding in the Fire Temple in Morheim. She won't wield it against you, but she's still strong nonetheless.</p>

          <p>Are you that attached to Kromede's Tear as a necklace?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's useful, sure, but it's hardly my best work. But reinforcing the Greatsword of the Judge...now THAT would be my best work.</p>

          <p>If you ever change your mind, come on back. I'll leap at this opportunity!</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's neither here nor there.  Especially if you got me the Greatsword of the Judge.</p>

          <p>Do you know how solid the Greatsword of the Judge is? It'd take a real sharding moron to mess it up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kromede's Tear is a different matter, but it's irrelevant. I'm the best there is. Just ask the Daevas of Flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Trust me on this, and double-up your efforts to get the Greatsword of the Judge, then make sure it's sitting pretty in your Cube, along with the Tears. The results will be worth it.</p>

          <p>Whew. The Greatsword of the Judge is solid. That's great for battle, but it did make the process harder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, take a look at the results. I think they speak for themselves.</p>
