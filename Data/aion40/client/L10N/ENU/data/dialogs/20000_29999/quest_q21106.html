          <p>Don't you find this Rhonnam rather odd? He's quite reticent with Asmodians, but he happily chats with Sapiens like they were kin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems suspicious to me.</p>

          <p>What's more, the Sapiens actually seem to like him. Call him "Master" Rhonnam.</p>

          <p>Shulacks, Kobolds and Skurvs aren't normally that trusting. Wonder if they're drugged somehow?</p>

          <p>Neither do I, and I intend to change that. I want to know who [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rhombus] really is.</p>

          <p>Excellent. I believe you are doing Asmodae a service.</p>

          <p>I suggest approaching [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Brauni_DF4_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Brauni_DF4_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ratman_DF4_01].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're talkative, and naive enough not to hold anything back if you approach them the right way. Good luck.</p>
