          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. Lord Marchutan and his agent, Mastarius, have not forgotten your valor.</p>

          <p>Were it not for your aid, and the aid of your fellow Daevas, we could not have driven out the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They both spoke highly of your strength and courage.</p>

          <p>You deserve every bit of it, and more. However, as you know, one battle does not win the war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos are demoralized, and in disarray. We must seize the advantage while we still can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a special mission for you. If you agree, and succeed, I will enhance the power of your spellbook.</p>

          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Spellbook.</p>
