          <p>Welcome back, [%username]. In your absence we have learned much about Kumbanda and his motives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kumbanda seems to be heading for the Vorgaltem Battlefield. This is quite an unexpected move. He is heading straight into an area swarming with Tiamat's legions, when he should be moving away from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I already asked for the Reian Anilmo's help in figuring out Kumbanda's motives. I hope to hear his report soon. In the meantime, we must assume Kumbanda is heading there, and prepare.</p>

          <p>In short: we must drive the Balaur from the Vorgaltem Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Vorgaltem is closest to the Balaur bulwark, and an entrance to the Silentera Canyon can be found there. If we fail to win there, we may as well give up any hope of stopping Kumbanda.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must weaken the Balaur! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ankea] at the Scout Post will direct your efforts.</p>
