          <p>We've been trying to break into [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A4_03] for quite a while. It's harder than it looks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those Calydons may not be as smart as we are, but they know their territory and how to defend it. We need an edge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you search [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A4_03], you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21518A]s. Think of them as primitive notes and memos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can gain valuable intelligence from them--perhaps even a way to shatter their defenses. Can you get some for me?</p>

          <p>The Humnaz tribe is a minor threat in the grand scheme of things, but they're still a threat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every Daeva we need to send to defend against them is one less to send against Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21518A]s are so vital.</p>

          <p>Ah! This one! It's a detailed description of Humnaz Territory defenses, and their troop strengths in various regions!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This will go to the strategists at once! Oh, my blood is flowing. Those Humnaz will meet their doom yet!</p>
