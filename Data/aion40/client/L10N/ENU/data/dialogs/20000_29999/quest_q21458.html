          <p>Success! And it's all thanks to you, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've made a major breakthrough. I now know an important factor behind Taloc's growth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet my triumph is tinged with concern. I will tell you what I've found, but only if you swear to not tell anyone else unless I permit it.</p>

          <p>Good. Now, I've discovered that Taloc's growth is now entirely dependent on the flow of Aether within it. The wood I've examined from inside Taloc proves it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However...I've also found that the very presence of Daevas inside Taloc apparently slow down Taloc's growth severely!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My theory is that Taloc sees unwelcome Daevas as invaders, like a disease, and focuses his power on them, thus taking Aether away from growth processes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So all the Daevas entering Taloc are unwittingly harming him! If I could ask you another favor...could you tell Lord [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vidar] of this?</p>

          <p>Thank you. You may not know this, but Lord [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vidar] has some knowledge of ecology. I trust he will make a wise decision.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would speak to him myself, but this discovery has created many issues that I must start looking into at once.</p>

          <p>Yes, I suppose it would make more of an impression for Lord Vidar to hear it from me personally.</p>

          <p>I hate to leave behind my research, though. There are still some important unanswered questions.</p>

          <p>I grow concerned about this war. Our resources are being stretched to the limit. Time is ever of the essence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many Daevas nowadays who lack the training, strength, or intellect to truly shine. If they are the best we have against the Balaur and Elysea...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you didn't come to listen to complaints, did you? What news do you have, young Daeva?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I will order stronger restrictions against entering Taloc. Tell Irkale I will also provide whatever resources she needs to continue her research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know what would happen should Taloc stop growing, but my instincts tell me it would not be good for any of us.</p>

          <p>But I must not borrow worry from the future. What did Lord Vidar have to say?</p>

          <p>Yes, that is good news. With more resources from Pandaemonium, I can really start getting things done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now that Lord Vidar is enforcing stronger restrictions to protect Taloc, I have a little more time.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Irkale discovered important facts about Taloc's growth, yet also found out something disturbing. She asked you to report her findings to Vidar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You delivered the news to Vidar, who promised both stricter protections for Taloc and more resources for Irkale's research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Irkale was delighted with this turn of events, hopeful that she would soon learn more about the great Elim.</p>
