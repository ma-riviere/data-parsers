          <p>I have spoken to the council of elders, and we are very disappointed in this latest Asmodian treachery. If I had my way, I'd banish you all from Sarpan now. However, the others have asked me to put aside my anger so that we can concentrate on getting Siel's Relics back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to know what Israphel plans to do with them. All these years he's been plotting, using the powers granted to him as an Empyrean Lord to further his plan in secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we must scramble to catch up.</p>

          <p>Of course. Your task now is to obtain Siel's Relics. [%username], I want to believe that you are different from the other Asmodians. Your support of the Reians had certainly shown it to be so. But I am still wary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask you to share all your information with us, and to act only in concert with us from now on. We must work together to get back the relics, or we will all lose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To that end, go and speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Aimah]. I hear he has a clue to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel]'s whereabouts.</p>

          <p>Glad to see you back, [%username], and not a moment too soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Convent of Marchutan found a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10071a] in the Throne of Blood once Israphel left, and they've sent us the readings. Perhaps we can use them to track Lord Israphel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only... I understand the Reians are not best pleased with us. This would be much easier with their assistance.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garnon2]'s got just the expertise we're looking for. Take this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10071a] to her, and ask her to analyze it. Then, be sure to get them back from her once you're done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate to keep her out of the loop, but we can't risk the Reians getting to Siel's Relics before us, so try to give her only as much information as she absolutely needs.</p>

          <p>This is... well, it's beyond anything I've seen before. I need to bring in the sorcerers and ask their opinion.</p>

          <p>Well, while I'm calling for a second opinion, you could go and investigate the [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_FOBJ_Q10051] that leads to his old hideout?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He won't be there, of course, but you may find something.</p>

          <p>It's very strong! Lord Israphel must have created it himself, as a safeguard against intruders. But don't worry, I can undo it. Good thing you came right back, though--if you'd have been much later, I think it might have been permanent!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Anyway, the sorcerers just brought me some information about that energy signature you found. It turns out that similar energies have been detected in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1].</p>

          <p>I'm saying this because I trust you, but I really need to know if you hear anything that could threaten the alliance between the Asmodians and the Reians. We can't afford to jeapordize it now.</p>
