          <p>This Bloodied Insignia. You say you found this in the arena? And you're sure your opponent dropped it? It wasn't in there when you entered?</p>

          <p>The blood has dried onto it in a way that makes it hard to tell, but this looks almost like a Guardian's crest....</p>

          <p>Inggness. I should have known she was behind this. Well, now you know part of the story, I suppose I should let you in on the rest, or you'll just keep probing until you've exposed everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos in the Coliseum were originally going to be phantoms, but we found a rift that connects our Crucibles with the Elyos ones. We built the Coliseum on top of it, and allow Daevas to use it for training so that we can monitor the situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's all I can tell you. Now, keep your mouth shut, or we'll have more trouble here.</p>

          <p>Kijan ordered you to get rid of the blasphemous insignia, but admitted that the Elyos inside the Crucible Coliseum were real, and swore you to secrecy.</p>
