          <p>Nothing brings me more pride than being a part of the Pandaemonium Expeditionary Force. But if it weren't for Svidar, I never would have gotten here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though lately...I have noticed he's been a little...odd. More so than usual. I think there's something in those Leowasp wings he keeps eating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he's still a great person. He's looked after me since I was a little girl--just take his ramblings with a grain of salt.</p>

          <p>I'm trying to keep Svidar's responsibilities in line while he's got this Leowasp wing obsession, and I could use some help. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Right now I need to clear out the area around the Crimson Temple and shore up our defenses.</p>

          <p>This shouldn't be too difficult for a Daeva of your skill. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You just need to dispatch the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Draky_DR_54_An]s in the Vorgaltem Battlefield near the Crimson Temple, and bring me back their horns as proof.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unlike Svidar, I can promise I'm not going to cook them...I just need the horns for confirmation.</p>

          <p>It's great having someone like Svidar to look out for me. Though I'm more looking out for him at the moment. </p>
