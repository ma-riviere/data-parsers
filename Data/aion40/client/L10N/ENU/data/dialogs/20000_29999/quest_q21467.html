          <p>But now...now his body is...dependent on its gentle support. Without it...he would fade away into splinters and dust.</p>

          <p>And what good...is that, Daeva, if it is taken from him before...its nourishment...fills him? There is a giant insect within Taloc...called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDElim_2F_NeutWorkmanfly_Qeen_52_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> It seems...she has started spawning young...within Taloc. Her eggs tap into his bark, and leech...his sap. The Aether that would...sustain him...is being drained away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need you to kill her, Daeva. Then the eggs will die, and Taloc...will survive this frost....</p>
