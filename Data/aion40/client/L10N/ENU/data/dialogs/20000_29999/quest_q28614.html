          <p>Kromede's Tear is a fascinating item, you know. And not just because I made it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's what it's made out of that make it special. In fact, those materials have a connection you should know about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're very intimately connected to a weapon Kromede herself owns.</p>

          <p>Well, if I were to get this weapon, the Spear of the Judge, and smelt down Kromede's Tear, I can fuse the two together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The result is a lot stronger than the weapon you'd start with. It's worth not having the necklace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, you'd have to get the Spear of the Judge yourself. But there's a big payoff to it. Want to give it a shot?</p>

          <p>Yes! First I get Dream Fragments, then I get to work with the Spear of the Judge! This is a great day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one little hitch, though. As I said, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae]--the real deal--has the spear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Fire Temple of Morheim is her current headquarters. I wouldn't suggest trying negotiations or reasoning with her, though.</p>

          <p>I feel a little sorry for Kromede too, but what's past is past.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's a different person now. I'd wager her need for vengeance has taken her over completely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can do more good for Asmodae by wielding the Spear of the Judge in its name than letting Kromede live. Think about it.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But analyzing others isn't what I do best. Blacksmithing is what I do best. So did you get the Spear of the Judge?</p>

          <p>Some Daevas are just so uptight. Look, you don't have to worry about the Spear of the Judge. I'll treat it like my own kin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for the success of the fusion, well, ask the Daevas of Flame how often I've achieved what I've started out to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd say I have a pretty good track record. Trust in it, and make the effort to get the Spear of the Judge! When you've got it, make sure it's in your Cube, along with the Tears, and we'll be right as rain.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But definitely not out of my skill range. Take a look. Can't you feel the improved strength?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should try it out on the battlefield. Let me know how you like it!</p>
