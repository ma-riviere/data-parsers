          <p>Good news for you, [%username]. Lord Marchutan has opened the Arena of Glory to regular Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Personally, I'm not looking forward to the extra cleanup, but who am I to argue with a Shedim Lord?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're feeling bold, go join in the carnage. Why let little things like a lack of skill or ability stand in your way? If you manage to not make a red smear across the Arena, bring back your Glorious Insignias to me.</p>
