          <p>As in any region, controlling Tiamaranta's fortresses is key to controlling the entire area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in the Dragon Lord's territory, it's especially important. We must weaken Tiamat if we are to face him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you--or rather, Asmodae needs you--to lay siege to the Hearts and defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q12049].</p>

          <p>It's not just the strategic value of the Hearts; the power within could mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And when it comes to Tiamat, defeat is not an option. How did the siege warfare go?</p>

          <p>The Fatebound Legion thanks you. Asmodae thanks you.</p>

          <p>We have much to do, but I know you will be right there by our side, doing what needs to be done.</p>

          <p>Gidon asked you to participate in siege warfare to gain control of fortresses so Asmodae could more easily defeat Tiamat.</p>
