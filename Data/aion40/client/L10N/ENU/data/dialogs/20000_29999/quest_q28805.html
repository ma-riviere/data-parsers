          <p>Do you want to live in a fancy house? If you do, you must first have a lot of Kinah. So, how can you get rich?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Earn more, spend less, certainly. Meanwhile, save money when you can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a place in Aurora State that collects vintage goods for houses. These items are used, but they're free.</p>

          <p>Some people buy expensive furniture and then throw it away, just because they want something new. But they'll never get rich like that, nyerk.</p>

          <p>The items in this [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Housing_FOBJ_Recycle_Box] are secondhand, but many of them are good as new. I don't know what might be in there today.</p>
