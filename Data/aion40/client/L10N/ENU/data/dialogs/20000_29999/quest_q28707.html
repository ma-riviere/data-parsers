          <p>You heard of these special "Raksang Pills" the Black Cloud Traders are selling?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They say the pills cured Balder's headache, eased Suthran's love woes, and even cured a small boil on a Methu's wing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may be a con, but if there's even the smallest chance that they work.... Trouble is, two [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18707A]s are needed to make a batch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugo say you can get one each from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_02_DrakanMirrorNmd_60_Ae] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_03_DrakanFiremage_Nmd_60_Ae]. You've been to Raksang; can you help?</p>

          <p>Other than [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_18707A]s, I don't know what goes into the Raksang Pill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I don't have to. I'll get the stones to the Shugo, and then we'll imbibe health and magic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The motto they use is pretty snappy, too. "From Aion's great laboratory..."</p>

          <p>The Shugo didn't describe them, so I had no idea what they'd look like. Do you feel any energy coming off them?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Supposedly, they invigorate Daevas in miraculous ways. Wait. Wait. I feel it. A floating sensation! Right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell you what. I'll reward you now, and let you know if I need any further pills. Thanks for the help!</p>

          <p>Merlean learned about a pill that cures all sicknesses, increases your abilities, and even makes you telepathic (but only if you use it correctly).</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though you were skeptical of the Black Cloud's claims, you went to get stones used in making this miracle medicine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Illusionmaster Sharik and The Flamelord, and brought their Runeseal Stones to Merlean. He kindly gave you Kinah instead of a share of his medicine.</p>
