          <p>The best thing about exploring new parts of the world is finding all the new native creatures, and finding out what their insides are good for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_Twister_Aurora_60_An]s, for example. Nothing like them in Asmodae, but you know what?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can still take the Luster Fragments inside them and use them to create the potions and scrolls that our armed forces, yourself included, need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of which, I just ran out of supplies. Care to harvest some more for me?</p>

          <p>Good, good. Like I said, these are new ingredients, and the recipes I use them in will likely need some refining before Pandaemonium orders them in bulk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Still, the more ingredients I have, the more refining I can get done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks for your help, [%userclass]. Blood for blood.</p>

          <p>Lumiden told you that Luster Fragments, found inside the nearby Shimmering Twisters, could be used to create a range of potions and scrolls. He asked you to gather some for him, which you did without too much difficulty.</p>
