          <p>You doubtless know of the Marchutan Priory. And, if you're like most, you're wondering what we can offer you now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we do more than shepherd young Daevas. We're also dedicated to increasing the strength of our veterans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're opening our headquarters, and the facilities within, to a wider audience because of Lord Marchutan's prophecy.</p>

          <p>Lord Marchutan foresaw a great battle in Gelkmaros against Tiamat's forces, a battle that we would lose. Badly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We may not avoid that fate, but we can still affect the future. Are you willing to put forth the effort?</p>

          <p>Good. Then see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tymora]. She'll tell you of the Empyrean Crucible and how it fits into our mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She'll also show you the way to Priory headquarters, where everything happens.</p>

          <p>Greetings. You're here about the Priory and Empyrean Crucible? We could use some more [%userclass]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've always trained both young and experienced Daevas, and now Lord Marchutan's visions give us an even greater sense of urgency.</p>

          <p>He foresaw a great battle at Vorgaltem against Tiamat's forces.... He also saw Asmodae's Daevas crushed in that battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were stunned, but his word is destiny. There's nothing we can do about Vorgaltem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But one battle does not shape all of destiny. Now that we know of our failure, we can keep it from repeating itself.</p>

          <p>Yes. It's a series of foes designed to give Daevas practice in combat and teamwork, to better prepare them for the hard future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's inside Priory headquarters, which is now open to all. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Virvain] over there can lead you to Marchutan Priory headquarters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anja] is in charge of the training. I wish you Aion's blessings.</p>
