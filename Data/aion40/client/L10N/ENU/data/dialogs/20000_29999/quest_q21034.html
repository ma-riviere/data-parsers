          <p>Blast! Those infernal Gryphu at the Dragonspine Rise are hindering my survey of Balaurean minerals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Gryphu have survived here in Balaurea for centuries, and their ferocity is unmatched. Even I'm a little scared of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd prefer to ignore them, but there's no way I can collect minerals with the beasts pecking at my head!</p>

          <p>I've asked other Daevas to collect ore from the Dragonspine Rise, but most are unwilling to do it because of the Gryphu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You look a little stronger than the Daevas I've sent before, though.... I think you might even be a match for the Gryphu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Condor_DR_51_An]s are a concern, but the real problem is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Condor_DR_NmdQ_52_An], the alpha of the flock. Think you could take care of them for me, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Great! First, eradicate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Condor_DR_51_An]s. Then find and dispose of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Condor_DR_NmdQ_52_An].</p>

          <p>I imagine once Skraw falls, the rest of the flock will disperse and allow me to survey the Dragonspine Rise in peace.</p>
