          <p>The Balaur around here still haven't recovered fully from your previous assault, but the ones who remain have grown more aggressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems they've taken your advice as well, and are pressing the offense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have a bulwark around the fortress, of course, but it won't keep the Balaur out for long.</p>

          <p>Yes! But we cannot simply react to every provocation, or it will distract us from our long-term goals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are planning a much larger scale operation elsewhere, but if the Balaur realize that then they might have time to prepare. We need to convince them that we are still focusing our efforts on the Antagor Battlefield.</p>

          <p>Exactly. While someone distracts the Balaur here, the Fatebound Legion and the Pandaemonium Expeditionary Force will begin to move out in secret.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you'd like to volunteer, I would ask you to attack [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardFi_51_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardAs_51_An] in the Antagor Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated them handily last time, so it should be easier now. Interested?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. With you on the job, it means I can send even more of my most elite Daevas off to the other operation. You can handle more on your own!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To increase the distraction, I might suggest you use some of your more spectacular attacks. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardFi_51_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardAs_51_An] will be dumbfounded!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>To help him, you attacked the Balaur near the bulwark as a distraction.</p>
