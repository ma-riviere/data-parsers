          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. The Manastone Removers Association is changing the face of business as we know it. We have learned many things from the creatures around us, but none so promising as what we learned from the Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From these diminutive people we have learned the fundamentals of unionization as well as supply and demand. We've transformed our small business into a lucrative, Kinah-making enterprise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the old manastones around here are almost worthless. But you sell them over in the bad parts of Baularea, and their value rises twenty-fold. We're a gross product distributor, so bundles of 10 only for my special daily deal. Got any?</p>

          <p>Go through your warehouse and cube and see what you have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got a big order I need to fill on the Balaurean black market, so I'm only looking for HP +70, Accuracy +22, and Block +22 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I'm not saying I sell these to the enemy... that would be unethical. But whose hands these manastones end up in, that's not my concern. Do you have what I'm looking for?</p>

          <p>Business has no boundaries, especially not to the newly unionized Manastone Removers Association. Even Lord Marchutan himself can't touch us now!</p>

          <p>I'm union chief Greger. Would you like me to remove your manastones for you? Or are you here to exchange?</p>

          <p>No, no, no, no.... These aren't going to work for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My clients are very particular about getting their paws on HP +70, Accuracy +22, and Block +22 manastones, not... this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can do no transaction for you, Daeva. Union rules. Business is business.</p>

          <p>Let's just see here.... Looks like HP +70, Accuracy +22, and Block +22 manastones. Pretty good condition. A few dings, but passable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These will turn a pretty Kinah to my other clients. Ah, it's nice selling old manastones to customers who have no idea what they are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As long as it glows when you touch it, eh? Idiots....</p>

          <p>Greger said the Manastone Removers Association had found buyers for old manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you brought a bundle of 10 manastones to him as requested, and he exchanged them for new ones, AND made a profit.</p>
