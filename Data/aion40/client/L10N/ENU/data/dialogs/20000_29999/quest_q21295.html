          <p>These records can't be right. No way I could have made an error like--oh! [%username]! Just, ah, going over the battle reports again. Good job on that by the way now I'm sure you have urgent things to do bye-bye see you later.</p>

          <p>I suppose it's no use trying to cover this up. And perhaps since you were so successful in your previous mission, you might actually be able to help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I thought that taking Padmarashka out would be enough to stop its Drakan spawn from hatching. The eggs are quite sensitive to temperature fluctuations, and they need careful incubation. But it turns out I need someone to help me while I track down every last one.</p>

          <p>Re-reading the Dramata Chaser reports, I found a paragraph that I'd missed, about the Dramata Protectors. You seen, most Dramatas just lay their eggs and move on, and it's the duty of the Protector to hatch them. It's just Padmarashka who got so protective of its eggs and insisted on staying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can locate the eggs just fine, but [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q11293] is a problem. I need you to call upon your League again and distract it while I sneak in and destroy the spawn. Please don't hold my harsh words from earlier against me!</p>

          <p>Um. Yeah. About that. I'm really sorry I came down on you so harshly earlier. I resented you for getting an easy ride, but now I can see that you have the skills to back it up. You really helped me out, even after I'd been so rude, and I won't forget that.</p>
