          <p>I'm an amateur Alchemist. I'm not quite as good as the apprentices, but I'm getting there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have learned one complex recipe, though: that for Guestbloom Fertilizer. With the right ingredients, I can make five a day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can make you some if you like; I need the practice. But I will have to ask you for the ingredients. The gathering part is something I'm still learning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need one each of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_d_fragment_amazing_01]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_d_fragment_scary_01]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_od_d_fragment_lonely_01]s. Get them, and I'll do the rest!</p>

          <p>Oh, hello; you're the Daeva who was asking about Guestbloom Fertilizer, aren't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time I make some, I get that much better at Alchemy, so I'm grateful for the practice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have all the Aether Gems I need, I can get started in making the batch right away!</p>

          <p>Ah, perfect! Now, I just need to add this, let it heat... Cool it down... then just do... that, and...</p>

          <p>Whew! I almost messed up near the end there! But here you are: five doses of Guestbloom Fertilizer!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come on back tomorrow if you want some more. As long as you have the Aether Gems, I can make the Fertilizer.</p>
