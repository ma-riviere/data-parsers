          <p>I have a message that needs to be delivered to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Angrad] in the Krug Basin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fortress Brigade General needs a status report on his work there. She's especially concerned because she's heard rumors that Angrad hasn't taken well to his posting.</p>

          <p>I don't know. Politics? Perhaps his superiors just didn't know what kind of personality Angrad has?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That would actually be quite bad if so--everyone has certain competencies. Knowing what they are is very important in leadership.</p>

          <p>But I'm rambling. Is this task one you could undertake?</p>
