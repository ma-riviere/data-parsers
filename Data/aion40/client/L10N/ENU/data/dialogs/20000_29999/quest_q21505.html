          <p>The fires still raged in Menin Village when I had to gather my most important possessions and leave. Too many Shulacks occupied the streets for safety.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On my way out, I saw [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_IronGolem_57_An]s razing buildings. All that effort to make a peaceful home, gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someday we'll get [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A2_02] back from the occupiers, but how much of it will survive? Would you put an end to the Scouts' wanton destruction?</p>

          <p>Why yes. My spear is very shiny as well as functional for killing Balaur and Shulacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like me to pose while you admire it?</p>

          <p>Thank you. You don't know how much it means to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you think it's silly to worry about mostly demolished buildings in an occupied village, but I think of the days when we drive out Tiamat's forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then we'll be glad to have standing structures.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed the Scouts, and he thanked you for saving the village's structures for future residents.</p>
