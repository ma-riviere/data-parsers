          <p>I am so tired of this war... of all wars. Against the Balaur, naturally, but also the ones that tear Atreians apart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's edict has only given some Elyos and Asmodians a reason to unite against another common hate: Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The recent unpleasantness in Raksang hasn't helped. If only we knew the truth about what Hiel did or did not do while brainwashed....</p>

          <p>Ah, yes. You see the pattern here? This is Hiel's personal touch; I'd recognize it anywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This Sealing Stone is proof indeed that he had involvement in Raksang. This is... distressing, to say the least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But at least this is confirmation, and we can decide what to do next with open eyes. Please do not hold this against us.</p>
