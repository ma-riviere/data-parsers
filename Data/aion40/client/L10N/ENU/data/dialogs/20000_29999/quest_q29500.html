          <p>At this rate I might even have to turn over my seat as Preceptor to you! Not that I think you'd want it...standing here can be a little boring.</p>

          <p>A frightening number of Daevas, [%username]. There are some so stuck in tradition that they forsake using Greater Stigma, just because some originate from the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the truth is, Greater Stigma are integral in our battles against them and the Elyos. And it just so happens that the Temple of Destruction sent me some to provide to worthy Gladiators.</p>

          <p>Let's see...the Temple of Destruction wants to make sure the recipients of the Greater Stigma can use them effectively. But how to prove...? Ah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use *** at least 10 times, and then return. If you can do that, I have no doubt that you'll be able to use what the Temple of Destruction gave me.</p>

          <p>These are rare Greater Stigma, and all you need to do is prove that you can use them effectively.</p>

          <p>Here, take this Greater Stigma. I would recommend testing it out in Gelkmaros--our forces there could use the help of a Gladiator of your skill.</p>
