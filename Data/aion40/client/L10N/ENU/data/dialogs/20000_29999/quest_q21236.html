          <p>Filth born, muck lurking, abhorrent Sandstorm Obscuras! The creatures are all around the Temple of Scales, and their incessant chattering and whisking about is driving me into a rage...a far more terrifying rage than is customary!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't concentrate on plotting death and mayhem with them swirling about just outside base!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But whenever I go out there to kill the creatures and put a stop to the racket, their numbers replenish before I even get back!</p>

          <p>I'm at my wit's end, [%username]. I need peace and quiet if I am to draw up a plan to defend the Temple of Scales.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to go out there and eradicate the Sandstorm Obscuras. Just stay as close as possible so I can hear them wail as they die. It gives me all kinds of warm and fuzzy thoughts...even reminds me of my childhood.</p>

          <p>That's not an invitation, [%username]. Anyway, there are all kinds of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Shadowstalker_Sand_55_An]s that roam the surrounding area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill as many as possible, and bring me their Black Souls as proof.</p>
