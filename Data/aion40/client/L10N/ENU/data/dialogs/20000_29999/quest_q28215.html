          <p>If you're here, Shinin must have sent you. Heh, he's a character, isn't he?</p>

          <p>Anyway, do you need a ticket for the Crucible Coliseum?</p>
          <p> </p>        
          <p>There are several arenas: the Arena of Discipline, where you fight one on one, the Arena of Chaos, where you fight several opponents at once, and the Arena of Harmony, where you team up with one other Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All are barred to those without the appropriate ticket. I have one for you right here, but be aware that these are limited.</p>

          <p>Just wait a moment while I check my list. So many Daevas to keep track of! I can't let them in too often, and I need to make sure you're eligible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need an assistant! I keep telling them, but do they listen? No, they do not.</p>

          <p>One Arena Ticket, coming up. Now, I should mention, I can only give you one of these per day, so make sure not to lose it. If you come here with some sob story about being mugged by Spriggs, I'll know you're pulling my wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, I should probably count myself lucky. I have a lot to keep track of, sure, but Inggness, now. She's juggling three Crucibles. All those illusions... how she does it, I'll never know. No wonder she's a bit... touched.</p>
