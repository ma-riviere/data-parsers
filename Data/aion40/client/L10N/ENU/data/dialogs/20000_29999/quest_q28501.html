          <p>But, only not supposed to let you enter. Now the Daeva has found Haramel, maybe Gestanerk would want us welcoming you here, letting you in on the market? Yes? No? Yes?</p>

          <p>Okay, here's deal. Daeva enters Haramel and gathers five chunks of unrefined Odium ore, and five chunks of refined Odium. Daeva takes all nine...ten samples to my brother Moofrenerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moofrenerk makes sure [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_18501all] quality is good, then tells you location of Gestanerk. No samples, no information! Good samples, good information! Easy!</p>
