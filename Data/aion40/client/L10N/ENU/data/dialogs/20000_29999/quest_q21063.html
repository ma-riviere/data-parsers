          <p>You? Vanquish [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_2111_Boss_Li_1]? Lord Marchutan may be wise, but here I fear he overestimates your abilities!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To even approach her, you must pass through [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_B7], already well-defended by hordes of Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even when you reach her, Veille is invested with Empyrean Lord Kaisinel's considerable power. She could rip any Asmodian apart with a gesture--except me, of course.</p>
