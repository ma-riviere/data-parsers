          <p>Blast those clumsy Archons! How is a scholar supposed to get any work done with them trampling all my specimens!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have so much to do, and so little time--now more than ever with the Balaur and Elyos breathing down my neck.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't suppose you're willing to help out, are you, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I knew you would recognize the importance of my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now then...when the Archons first raged through Vorgaltem Battlefield, they smashed the Balaur bulwark.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will admit it was a spectacular sight to behold. But after the battle was over the Archons milled about the decimated bulwark and trampled all kinds of rare materials I could have used for my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need those materials...before they're ruined. Can you help me out, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent! Now then, this should be simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to head to the edge of Vorgaltem Battlefield and inspect the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Trash_Q21212]s scattered around the collapsed wall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They might seem like useless rocks, but to a scholar, they're valuable research material. I'm counting on you, [%username].</p>

          <p>My little brother Itar and I might conduct our research in different fields, but we share the same passion for knowledge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know, I know, I look like the smart one in the family, but Itar is actually quite intelligent. Though I do worry about him...he's always so bold when it comes to conducting research. That boldness could be the end of him one day.</p>

          <p>Well then, did you bring what I asked?</p>

          <p>By studying this specimen I will be able to learn more about the Balaur, and knowledge is half the battle, my friend. Thank you for your help--please take this.</p>
