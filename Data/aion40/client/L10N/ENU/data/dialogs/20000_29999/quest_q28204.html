          <p>Ah, you're really starting to sweat in the Crucible now, aren't you, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You'd better save up those Worthiness Tickets, because you're going to need them.</p>

          <p>That's not an insult to your skills.... It's just reality. That's the way we designed the Crucible.</p>

          <p>It has to be, considering its purpose. We'd be doing Asmodae no favors by going easy on you.</p>

          <p>No, let's step it back just a little first. How about you clear Stage 9 this time?</p>

          <p>Ah, Stage 9 is one of my favorites. The opponents in it are massive. You may have even fought against a few before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let that fool you. Thanks to Inggness, they may have a few new tricks up their rather large sleeves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I look forward to seeing how you do.</p>
