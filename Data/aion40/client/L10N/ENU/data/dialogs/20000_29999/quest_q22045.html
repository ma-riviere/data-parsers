          <p>Now we control this place, but we all know that the Balaur will back before long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to be ready for that inevitability. We need to match their steel with ours, and force them back with well rested and able-bodied soldiers. That means giving our guards a break from the nearby terrors, like the White Stonefury Statues that parade around the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you destroy them for us, [%username]? The respite is desperately needed.</p>

          <p>Mustan told you how the White Stonefury Statues were distracting the soldiers who were supposed to be resting up for the inevitable Balaur assault. You decided to help, and crushed the statues into dust.</p>
