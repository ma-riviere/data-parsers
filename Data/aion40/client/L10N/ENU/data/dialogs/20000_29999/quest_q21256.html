          <p>Thanks to you and other Daevas, the Elyos have been dealt a humiliating defeat, driven out from a position of such strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Agent Mastarius sends his personal praise, along with that of Lord Marchutan himself. The Lord observed the battle with keen interest, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He would have stepped in if he was truly needed, but he was gratified to find he didn't have to.</p>

          <p>As do we all. Which is why you're asked to conduct another mission, perhaps even more perilous than past efforts.</p>

          <p>The Elyos are demoralized and reeling. They won't be able to defend Inggison when we invade.</p>

          <p>Daevas like you give me hope for Asmodae's future. With soldiers like you on our side, victory is inevitable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are to invade Inggison and kill the Guardian Generals of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elyos will quake with fear, knowing we have a presence there. I wish you all the blessings of the Shedim Lords.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Dagger.</p>
