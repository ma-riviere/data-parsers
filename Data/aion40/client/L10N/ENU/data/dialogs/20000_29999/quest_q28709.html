          <p>To have been Drakan, lord of all Atreia, and hence reduced to this paltry Sapien form for eternity... 'Tis dishonor, troth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only be glad that mine subordinates cannot see me so laid low... like Chaokiki.... He was a Shulack, loyal for his kind. His song was espionage, sabotage, his feet fleet; he was much alike a shadow in the dark.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If thou hast pity for my plight, wouldst thou find Chaokiki and tell him his lord lives anon... in a sense?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>He has been working off debt to us ever since. But one worry we always had was that old master might return someday.</p>

          <p>Will tell others no need to worry now! Here, Daeva, why don't you take little something for easing our minds, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Maduka, a ghost in Raksang, asked you to deliver a message to Chaokiki, a Shulack who used to serve him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It turned out that Chaokiki did not die in glorious battle, but was living right in Pandaemonium, thriving by selling items to Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you told Maduka's message to Chopirunerk, he was relieved, as he was always concerned about Chaokiki's old bond with the Balaur.</p>
