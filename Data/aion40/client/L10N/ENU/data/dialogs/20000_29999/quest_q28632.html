          <p>You're not going to wear it, are you? Tsk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I got a better idea. Melt down the Flame, then use it to coat the Tome of the Judge.</p>

          <p>It's complicated, but if you want to see how it's done, you'll need to bring me both items.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've got Kromede's Flame, so you're halfway there. Now you just need the Tome of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>	
          <p>Fortunately, I can tell you where to get that...if you're interested.</p>

          <p>Good choice. You won't regret it. Now, as to that Tome of the Judge.... </p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>Word in Morheim is that a little lady you know named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] has it. She's in something called the Fire Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ask around, I'm sure someone can tell you how to get there.</p>

          <p>You think I can't stick a necklace and a book inside a raging flame without destroying both items?</p>

          <p>I know that sounds crazy, but I'm not an amateur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about this. I'm sure you'll change your mind.</p>

          <p>Did you bring me the Tome of the Judge? All I need is that and Kromede's Flame, and we can proceed as planned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't weep for Kromede.... She's been taken over by grief and hate. She doesn't deserve your compassion anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now let me just stoke this flame and we'll toss that book in there.... You seem nervous. Is there a problem?</p>

          <p>Once I took a polearm and I turned it into a dagger, and then back into a polearm. A much smaller polearm, true....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, I have no doubt I can combine the Tome of the Judge and Kromede's Flame. Come to me with both in your Cube, and I'll prove it to you.</p>

          <p>Or, wait...does Kromede's Flame go in first? I think I got that backwards. Oh well, too late now. Let's see what happens....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hey, it worked. It's Kromede's Tome! That's good to know. I'd better write that down for next time.</p>

          <p>Walter said Kromede's Flame can be used to reinforce the Tome of the Judge, and asked you to bring him both items.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Contrary to logic, you trusted him and gave him both Kromede's Flame and the Tome of the Judge. Walter somehow managed to not destroy both items, giving you Kromede's Tome.</p>
