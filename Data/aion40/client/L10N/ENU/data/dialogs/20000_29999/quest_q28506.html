          <p>So, Gestanerk. Many think of Gestanerk as big important Shugo, master of Haramel and ruler of Odium black market.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Truth, though...truth is very different.</p>

          <p>Truth is Gestanerk is just puppet. Asmodian named Hamerun pulls Gestanerk's strings, which pulls Haramel's strings in turn. You see, Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Truth is...if Daeva were to approach Gestanerk, he would be thankful for your intervention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should speak to Gestanerk. Story from Trico's mouth, or whatever, yes?</p>

          <p>Smart Daeva! Sees with branches of a rotting tree, should be climbed up to reach the highest point. No sense hacking down lowest branches first. No sense hurting us lowly Shugos...no no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva must see Gestanerk now, before it too late. Run past Haramel Tower, run through Odella Nursery, get to Haramel Skylift! Gestanerk normally there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember! Shugos are innocent here! Gestanerk included! Hamerun is responsible! Shugos are innocent!</p>
