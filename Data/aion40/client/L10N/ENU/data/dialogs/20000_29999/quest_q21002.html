          <p>When we first took this fortress, the Balaur were completely unprepared. They never imagined we could resurrect this place, even though we had been preparing for years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should have seen them flee as our battleships soared in, elite Archons dropping from the sky amongst them. I almost wish they had stayed to fight.</p>

          <p>It would have been glorious!</p>

          <p>Of course, the Gelkmaros War was not the first. We had already engaged in several battles here, the famous Antagor Battle chief among them. Much blood has been shed....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a pity you find yourself here now. As we are discovering, defending this place is far more difficult than occupying it in the first place.</p>

          <p>...is a good offense. Exactly my thinking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rather than sit here and wait for their next assault, we should press the attack and wipe them out. All of them, starting with those Balaur who were trapped behind our front line.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think? Are you up for a little Balaur hunting?</p>

          <p>Many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardFi_51_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_LizardAs_51_An]s are still wandering about in the Antagor Battlefield just outside the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Getting rid of them is technically Vyuin and Danomdel's job, but they're busy repairing the bulwark. That means you get to have all the fun. Sound good?</p>

          <p>Hmmm.... Are you scared? This is Tiamat's territory, true, but you don't need to worry too much. Many of them are injured, and most are weakened from lack of Drana.</p>

          <p>I'm sure you have other things to do now, but stop by again when you have a spare moment. I'm sure someone here will have some more work for you.</p>
