          <p>The greatest weapon Asmodae wields in this war is not a sword or a bow--it is its people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our hearts are stronger than polearms, our minds sharper than greatswords, our passions hotter than any spell any orb could produce.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Elysea fights with inferior weapons that look strong, but are brittle at its core. Which do you think will triumph in the end?</p>

          <p>But their arrogance also keeps them from realizing just how weak they are. So they continue to strut and preen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Veille, minion of Kaisinel, is one of the worst. In a sad attempt to shape better "weapons," she whips up unwarranted arrogance in her people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even now, as Asmodae marches on her stronghold, she believes she is unstoppable, that she alone will turn back the tide.</p>

          <p>Indeed. However, her just fate will not come without the participation of Daevas like you.</p>

          <p>Every time [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_2111_Boss_Li_1] dares show her face on the battlefield, you must show all Elysea what a coward she truly is.</p>
