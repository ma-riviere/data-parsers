          <p>I always held you in the highest regard as a student, [%username], but I'd bet now you could teach me a thing or two about Aethertapping!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's truly amazing that you attained the level of Expert so soon. I admit I'm a little envious of your talent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But poor is the teacher who is not surpassed by their student, so I'm not too distressed over it. Well, if I can stop blathering here for a moment, we'll make this official!</p>

          <p>Well, first the Master writes a letter of recommendation for their student, then High Priest Agehia gives her approval, and then there's a brief ceremony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that you will receive the title of Aethertapping Expert, and all of Asmodae will know of your accomplishment! Exciting, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, head to the Convent of Marchutan and seek out the High Priest. You are prepared to accept this honor, right, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Excellent! Now...I just need a moment...to write out a letter of recommendation...just another formality...the High Priest loves her formalities....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There, it's done. Take this to High Priest Agehia, and you will be recognized as an Aethertapping Expert. I'm proud to have played a part in helping you achieve this honor, [%username].</p>
