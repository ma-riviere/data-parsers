          <p>Exactly. It seems this area's gone through a lot of change since the Cataclysm.... Maybe it was more civilized then? Who knows?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever the cause, Taloc's been affected as much as anything else. Insects inside him have been mutated by Aether and gone out of control.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not only harming him, but they've been spotted even here in Gelkmaros. You up for an extermination expedition?</p>

          <p>Thanks. I have orders to do it myself, but I can't spare the manpower, and, well...giant bugs. Disgusting!</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11048_1F] are strong enough to leave Taloc and infest the surrounding areas. If we let them go too long...</p>
