          <p>Unlike many who were called here to serve, I volunteered. I may appear to be nothing but a mere weapons quartermaster, but I have far bigger dreams. I wish to honor my family.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, most of my family were killed by Balaur, and I am set to inherit what remains of the business. That's why I came here not just as a supply soldier, but to study as a Weaponsmith too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I don't want to run just any old weapon store--I want to open a chain of stores that are worthy of bearing my family name.</p>

          <p>Like my ancestors, I want to sell only the best weapons! Blades that are worthy of my family's reputation. Swords that will go down in legend!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to my training, I'm already second to none in sharpening blades, but my knowledge of armor is somewhat limited. I need to learn more. Much more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, the best sword is one that can penetrate any armor, isn't it?</p>

          <p>To be honest, the real reason I came to Gelkmaros was to...to get Balaur armor. It's reputed to block almost all weapons. My parents learned that the hard way....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not going to stop until I've created swords that will pierce Balaur armor. But to do that, I need to be certain. I need to test my swords against the real thing.</p>

          <p>I had heard there were many [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_DrakanCoprse_Q21000]s in the Antagor Battlefield not far from here. Do you think you could bring me some of their armor?</p>

          <p>Did you bring the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21000a]? I heard it has special properties, with an energy you can feel from several paces away. Hot and cold, all at once. Icy hot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you ask me, I don't think it's really a temperature variance. It's got to be something much more powerful. After all, Balaur armor is made from Balaur skin. Or so I've heard.</p>

          <p>That's it! Can you feel that? Such a curious aura. Almost like Aether, but different....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Definitely Balaur skin, too. It's amazing that the Balaur are able to hone their own skin until it gets smooth like this, and strong.... It must take forever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad for them--with this, I can make weapons that will pierce even the hardest Balaur armor. They won't stand a chance! My family will be avenged. Finally....</p>
