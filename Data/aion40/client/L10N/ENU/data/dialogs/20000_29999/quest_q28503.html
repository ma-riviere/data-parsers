          <p>Ah, clever Daeva! You understand language of business very well!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moofrenerk has friend who sometimes finds buyers for Odella. Gestanerk keeps most of profit, but friend has private buyer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can sell to private buyer, we keep Kinah! Problem is, Gestanerk keeps sharp eye on Odella count. That is where you come in, Daeva.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, Moofrenerk will share in profits from private transaction. You hurt Gestanerk plan, and we get Kinah! Win-win, yes?</p>
