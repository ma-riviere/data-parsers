          <p>Usener, who dwells in Pandaemonium. She has served Asmodae well in the past.</p>

          <p>However, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener] will most likely require some kind of payment for her time.</p>

          <p>A wise choice. Any advantage over Asmodae's enemies must be grasped with strong claws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think she--or anyone--has worked with such a weapon and materials before, but she will rise to the challenge. Of that I am certain.</p>

          <p>Yes, I can definitely do it, but it will take a lot of other materials and labor, so I'm afraid I can't do it for free.</p>

          <p>Still, if you decide to spend the Kinah, PLEASE come back! I promise, I'll treat your greatsword like my firstborn. Just remember it needs to be sitting in your Cube, not equipped, when you come to me.</p>
