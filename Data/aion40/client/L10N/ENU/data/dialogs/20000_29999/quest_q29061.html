          <p>You know something, [%username], I think we have quite a bit in common, really. A shared passion for chasing death, a knack for the weapons of the [%userclass], and the same love of cupcakes. Well, maybe not that last part.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But your skills have grown beyond what I can teach you. Here, take this recommendation letter to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hoogerwerf]. He will become your teacher now, as he was once mine. I look forward to hearing about your continued accomplishments.</p>

          <p>Hmm, I've been waiting for you, [%username]. Sigyn told me she'd be sending me a solid [%userclass] for additional training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me see her letter. She may have put some additional information in there.</p>

          <p>That Daeva hasn't changed a bit. She knows I'd teach you, recommendation or not, but feels it's her duty to detail everything her students have done as part of her recommendation process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It sounds like you impressed her, though, and that's not easy to accomplish. Don't pat yourself on the back just yet though. If you thought training with Sigyn was difficult, just you wait until I start with you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be alert, you never know when death may come looking for you!</p>
