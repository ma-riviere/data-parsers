          <p>Well, I suppose I'd better let you get back to it. And... oh! Why don't you take this necklace with you? It will help you whenever you're in trouble and should help you find the Protector that much faster.</p>

          <p>Working secretly with Aimah, you reported back to Garnon and told her that you couldn't find the Protector before setting off to meet her for the first time. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You tried to break the seal to the Protector's room, only to be attacked by the Balaur. However, you were able to fight them off, largely thanks to the necklace given to you by Garnon. Oriata then appeared. You asked her for the power to seal Siel's Relics, but she had been weakened and needed saving. You brought her the crystals she needed, and as you returned, Garnon and the Elyos leader emerged, vouching for you to receive the powers she had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You were given the power by Oriata, along with a stern warning to use the power for the benefit of all Atreia, else the planet would be doomed forever.</p>
