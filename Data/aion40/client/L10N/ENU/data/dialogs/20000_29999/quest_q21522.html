          <p>This is it, my friend. The doors to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel] Legion are finally open to you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The elders cannot deny you access any longer. They will look past your Asmodian origins, and welcome you into their arms as they would any Reian. You'll see this yourself, because you'll tell the elders yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's right. I want you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raffaele], look him in the eye, and tell him you completed the Koligran. Of all the elders, it was he who most vehemently opposed your entry.</p>

          <p>Ah. Yes. [%username]. I heard you had decided to challenge the Koligran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must admit I admire your optimism. Still, you are not one of us, and you have no right masquerading as one. Hopefully the Koligran showed you the strength of the Reian spirit, and dissuaded you from this foolish path of yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take no offense to my words, Asmodian. Your people are as protective as ours. You would have acted in the same manner had a Mamut sought to become an Archon. Some things just cannot be.</p>

          <p>This is unexpected. I do not know what to say. I cannot convene with the other elders as we gave our word to Kahrun that you would be accepted should you pass. And you weren't supposed to pass.</p>

          <p>[%username], I will grant you access to Siel's Spear Legion. This day will be remembered by both Asmodians and Reians for all time, hopefully for good reasons.</p>

       		<p>Kahrun told you how the elders had opposed you joining the legion, and set you the Koligran, fully expecting you to fail at it. Now that you'd passed it, it was time to confront the elders, and demand entry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You traveled to Rafael, the head of elders, and told him of your accomplishments. They, and sheer will, finally convinced him of your right to join Siel's Spear, and authorized the transfer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You return to Kahrun, who celebrated with you as you were officially taken in under the legendary legion's wing.</p>
