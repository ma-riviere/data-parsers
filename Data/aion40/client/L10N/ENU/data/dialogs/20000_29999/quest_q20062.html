          <p>[%username], I just heard back from my scientists. Unfortunately, as strong as the power cell you found was, it's not strong enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They need more items if we're to monitor any of Tiamat's sources. I hate to ask you to help again, but...</p>

          <p>[%username], you are a lifeline within a sea of apathy! Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said, we need more materials to help power the monitors. This time, though, I know just the thing! The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Monster_M_Flyingeye]s in the Giant Crater are inherently magical beings, with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_10060b]s that are packed full of energy for us to harness.</p>

          <p>Perfect! Now we just need to install the device.</p>

          <p>I've already placed a ward near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_S7]. That's where the monitor must be positioned, so please, take the Vigilance Core to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_ItemUseArea_Q20062A], activate it, and you'll set everything we've planned in motion. Remember, the ward will appear as a blue ring on the ground, but it will be invisible to the Balaur.</p>
