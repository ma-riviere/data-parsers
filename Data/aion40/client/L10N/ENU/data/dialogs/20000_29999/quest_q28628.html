          <p>Wait, [%username]. What are you planning to do with Kromede's Flame?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You could wear it as a necklace, of course, but that would hardly be the way to unlock its true potential.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, the way to do that is to melt it down--hang on, let me finish--melt it down and combine it with the Sword of the Judge.</p>

          <p>To reinforce the Sword of the Judge, you need three things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, you need Kromede's Flame--which you've already got. Next you need a talented blacksmith, and, well, here I am.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And obviously, to reinforce the Sword of the Judge you need to possess it first. Sound interesting?</p>

          <p>I don't mean to toot my own horn here, but I really do think I'm an excellent smith. You can trust me with this task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But like I said, before we begin you'll need the Sword of the Judge.</p>

          <p>From what I've heard, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] in the Fire Temple of Morheim is the present owner. Why don't you go make her an offer she can't refuse?</p>

          <p>One day I'll be one of the most famous blacksmiths in all Asmodae! Possibly all Atreia!</p>
