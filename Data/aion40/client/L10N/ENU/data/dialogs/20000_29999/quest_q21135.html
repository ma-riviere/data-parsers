          <p>I apologize for the mystery, but this is that important. I can't afford to risk it leaking out, especially not to....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I shouldn't say that either. I will tell you that it could mean the difference between victory and defeat here in Gelkmaros.</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]. I'd been told you were coming. Let me fill you in. You know that Nunglark Village was destroyed by the Balaur, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, whatever power they wielded not only destroyed the village, but changed the very composition of the soil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is very exciting. If we can get any information on the initial attack, we could unlock the secrets of Tiamat's power.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Unfortunately, the villagers aren't of much help, what with the trauma and the usual difficulties of eyewitness accounts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, one of them told me that there was a Shulack in the village who was a top-notch tinkerer. He created a bead that records images. If that bead was active during the attack, it could've captured the whole incident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those images could be invaluable to us. Ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gehlen]; he might know something of the matter. I'll continue my own investigations in the meantime.</p>
