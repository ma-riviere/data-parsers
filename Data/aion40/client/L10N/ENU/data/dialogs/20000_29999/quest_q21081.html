          <p>It's not easy, being here. The dead know that better than most, of course, but you've got stories and scars in those eyes of yours that'd fell the strongest of our kin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One dead Asmodian is one less Daeva to fight the Balaur, and the cowards. So, we need to gear up. Make us tougher than steel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better weapons makes for stronger Daevas. Simple logic. Show me that weapon of yours.</p>

          <p>Good. Pride gets you places, no doubt, but we've built our foundations on each other's support. This is no different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this Supply Certificate to a supply soldier, and you'll soon wield something infinitely more powerful than your current weapon. Think of this as a favor from your own blood. Your debt can be repaid in the blood you spill with your reward.</p>
