          <p>Finally! That monitor you installed has given us useful information. I've just received the first report. Let me tell you--it's quite a read.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems that if a heart is in danger, one of Tiamat's Incarnations will appear. That alter ego must be killed before the heart itself is incapacitated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah no... I misread! Tiamat's Incarnation is the heart itself!</p>

          <p>That's what it says here. Each heart has one incarnation. The Fissure Incarnate for the Heart of Fissure, the Petrification Incarnate for the Heart of Petrification, and so on. I can't expect you to do all this, but I would like you to fight against the Heart of Petrification, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Petrification Incarnate appears only once [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_Occupation_Combat] has begun. Obviously, this isn't something that you can carry out alone, so bring trusted allies and friends to fight alongside you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, one last thing. The Fatebound Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Benjal] said that he would go there to help you. Meet him once the siege starts. And good luck!</p>

          <p>Garnon told you that destroying Tiamat's Alter Ego (the Petrification Incarnate beast at the Heart of Petrification, in this case) would grant its victor control over the heart. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You tested the theory, killed the Petrification Incarnate, and returned. Garnon was amazed at your progress and sent you on to meet Adella, who told you the toughest fight was yet to come, as Tiamaranta's Eye would soon be accessible.</p>
