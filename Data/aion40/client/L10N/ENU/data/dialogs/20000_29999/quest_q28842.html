          <p>The seasons in Pernon are really beautiful, aren't they?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All things in Pernon grow and die along the cycle of seasons. You can create some amazing things when you know that. For example, I'm gathering plant leaves that harness the energy of the four seasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I don't have an easy way to collect them, as I must wait for each season to turn. If you bring me Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter Leaves, I'll reward you well.</p>

          <p>Now, let me tell you about the leaves. They're all different, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Spring Leaf has the energy of hope, the Summer Leaf has a nurturing energy, the Autumn Leaf has the energy of change, while the Winter Leaf possesses the energy of wisdom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm actually working on a way of combining these four leaves into one. Imagine it--the energies of all four seasons balanced within a single leaf!</p>

          <p>Your patience is remarkable. You waited for each season to pass, and collected a leaf for each one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These will be greatly helpful for my research. I hope you find this reward helpful, particularly as you seek other discoveries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll give you the same reward whenever you bring me the Leaves of Four Seasons, and I'd be grateful for your help again, next year.</p>
