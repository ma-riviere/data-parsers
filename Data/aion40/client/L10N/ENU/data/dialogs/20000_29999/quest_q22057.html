          <p>Feel that heat! So dry and bracing! Doesn't it just make you feel so alive? Not like the cold, so draining and sluggish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too bad it's all been formed by Tiamat's power. It tells you a lot about him that he'd create a place like this to live.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Dragonfly_58_An]s! Every patrol is delayed dealing with the sharding things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say... if you could cull them, reduce their numbers, our patrols would run more efficiently.</p>

          <p>Maybe I should wear more layers. Then I could enjoy even more warmth while I'm here....</p>

          <p>Good to hear. Now maybe our patrols won't be so tired all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say, I don't suppose you saved any of their carcasses? I hear they retain heat very well....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? Shame. Good job anyway, though.</p>

          <p>Kaisa complained that dealing with Flame Leowasps was causing patrols to return delayed and tired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you killed some for her, much to her gratitude (even with her obsession with heat).</p>
