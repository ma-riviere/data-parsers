          <p>If you're willing to give up its beauty, I can use it to create something even better.</p>

          <p>You see, the materials I used to make it have a special connection to Kromede.</p>

          <p>Actually, to a weapon she owns--the Staff of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If a famed, talented, good-looking blacksmith were to fuse the two, the staff's power would go up significantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you'd need to do is get the Staff of the Judge itself. Care to give it a try?</p>

          <p>And I thought life couldn't get any better! Now I'm going to be performing one of the most complex blacksmithing procedures ever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Staff of the Judge is in the hands of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae]. Yeah, the real Kromede.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's set up camp in the Fire Temple in Morheim. I suggest bringing some friends...you know she's no pushover.</p>

          <p>Look, when I call myself one of the best smiths in Asmodae, I'm not just making empty boasts here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just ask the Daevas of Fire. Examine something, anything, they're carrying. You'll see for yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it's Kromede you're worried about, don't be. At this point, I think she's irredeemable.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But something good can come from her. Do you have the Staff of the Judge?</p>

          <p>No, sorry, it's not. Or at least, it's not in your Cube. Did you even encounter Kromede? I understand she's no picnic to fight, especially after her Trial.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, as I said, she's not that innocent anymore. I think she's condemning all Shadow Judges, even if they had nothing to do with what happened to her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She needs to be stopped. You're the one to do it. When you've got everything, put them in your Cube and come see me. You won't regret it.</p>

          <p>The Daeva who loves what he does is blessed by Aion. And so are you, now that you have the new and improved Kromede's Staff.</p>
