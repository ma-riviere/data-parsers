          <p>I can't believe that an operation like Haramel was being run so close to Impetusium! Right under all our noses!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I blame myself. I've been under too much stress, tried to do too much on my own. I know I've been slipping lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now this! It's just not me, either; many of those here are kicking themselves for not noticing it.</p>

          <p>I know that in my head, but my heart tells me otherwise. Same with the troops here. They're planning all sorts of raids on Haramel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd encourage it, but it's a serious distraction from our main work: rebuilding Impetusium. But I can't blame them either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As long as Haramel still exists, it will be a weight on us all. You've been there...can you relieve our burden for us?</p>

          <p>Ah, that's the first good news I've heard in...well, longer than I care to remember.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q28504] are still keeping its operations going. They must be killed if its sinister work is to stop for good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Destroy everyone and everything you can in there. I'll tell the troops everything is taken care of. That alone is a huge help.</p>

          <p>Well, maybe we are. But we're Asmodians. We have our pride. And it's been wounded by that blasted plantation.</p>

          <p>Things have calmed down a little since word of what you're doing has spread, but the grumbling's rising again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seems everyone's agreed: if you can't get the job done, they'll take care of Haramel themselves.</p>

          <p>But our pride's been saved, and we can actually get back to our main mission. You don't know what this means to me...to all of us. Thanks.</p>
