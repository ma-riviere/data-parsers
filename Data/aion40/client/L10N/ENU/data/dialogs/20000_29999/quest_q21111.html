          <p>I would! But Bibiti thinks you are a weakling compared to this other Daeva. I defended you, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During our argument, Bibi Kal joined in, saying another Daeva was even stronger than either of you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We argued and argued, but could not come to an agreement. So we decided to make a wager.</p>

          <p>Just a small, friendly wager, [%username]. I bet on you, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you win, the refugees would really look up to you. Think of what you could do with that respect!</p>

          <p>Really, it is just one little test of strength. Asmodians value strength, do they not?</p>
