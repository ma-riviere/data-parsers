          <p>Actually, I feel a little bad for making you and Lucia get this to me.</p>

          <p>Don't get me wrong...I'm grateful, and I'm not turning into her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I can't really use these tools for what I was planning to use them for.</p>

          <p>Well, there's this geyser nearby that stopped flowing all of a sudden. I was going to use the tools to unplug it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I recently discovered that it wasn't a collapse of rock that's clogging it up. It's a huge Mudthorn!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess it's using the geyser as a hot spring. And you can't exactly break a Mudthorn apart with a hammer.</p>

          <p>Hah! I suppose so! Still, it's a problem. That geyser is pretty important to getting around the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My orders are to keep all travel avenues open. Unfortunately, I'm also a little behind schedule, thanks partly to that Mudthorn.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you busy? If not, I'd consider it a great personal favor if you could unclog that geyser for me.</p>

          <p>That's a great load off my mind. Now, the geyser in question is in the eastern part of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SZ_DF4_C1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C1_Mudthorn_55_An] only pokes its head out when it's hungry, so keep your eyes peeled.</p>

          <p>Of course. What was I thinking? We've really only just met, and here I am asking you to do work for me already.</p>

          <p>Never mind. Forget I asked. I'm sure you have better things to do.</p>

          <p>Anyway, I'd better get back to work. I need to figure out some way to get that Mudthorn out. Thanks again for the delivery.</p>

          <p>As you can see, you have a great view of that geyser from over here. So I saw some of your battle with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C1_Mudthorn_55_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That was some fight! It put up much better resistance than I thought it would.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe it was a particularly old Mudthorn? In any case, I saw the end, so I don't need to ask you if you succeeded.</p>
