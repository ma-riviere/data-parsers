          <p>Okay, my next plan is pretty simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go gather some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21510A]s from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A4_Worm_Oasis_56_An]s. There are a bunch growing in the desert oasis in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1].</p>

          <p>I'll explain later. Hurry!</p>

          <p>You're back! [%username], you look like you've been dragged through a Balaur garrison. Oh--I guess I forgot to tell you that the Amphas can be a bit violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whew! You must have been successful. I can smell those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21510A]s from here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, it's awful. Uck. It's like someone ate a pair of dirty socks, and threw them back up onto a fire.</p>

          <p>Ugh. Like a dead Brax dropped in a sulphuric volcano crater that's also full of old banana peels.</p>

          <p>Tanitia insisted that her plan required fruit, and sent you to gather the fruits of the Carnivorous Ampha.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She neglected to warn you that the Ampha was violent. She also neglected to warn you that the fruits smelled like if a Hornskull gorged on so many Mela that it exploded and then mouldered in the hot sun for a week.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You were eager for her next assignment.</p>
