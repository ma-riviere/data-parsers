          <p>Welcome to the headquarters of the Marchutan Priory. Not bad for a bunch of "thinwing coddlers", eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I know you wouldn't call us that, but there are plenty who do. They're idiots.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if nothing else, the Empyrean Crucible shame such Daevas. I'd like to see them try to run it.</p>

          <p>Indeed. But enough about those posturing weaklings. I assume you're here to challenge the Crucible, and I'm sure you'll do fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in case you didn't know, it's for groups. And it's kill or be killed in there. Either the group survives, or they don't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, why don't we make it a little more interesting.... If you're up to it.</p>

          <p>Hah, I knew it. Well, first you need to get your allies together. Asmodae can't win with just one individual, and neither can you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then, enter the Crucible. All you need to do is complete Stage 3 by defeating the Tran of Fire and the Tran of Wind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sounds simple, doesn't it? But we'll see if it actually is. Report back to me once you've succeeded.</p>
