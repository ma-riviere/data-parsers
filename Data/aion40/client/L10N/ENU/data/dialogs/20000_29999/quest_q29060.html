          <p>I've been waiting for you to return, [%username]. You have learned everything that I can teach, and thus, as Kalsten sent you to me with a recommendation letter, so do I send you to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Garvan] with a recommendation of my own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deliver this letter to Garvan quickly. You are well on your way to becoming a great [%userclass], and he will provide you with the guidance you now need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May you always walk in Azphel's shadow.</p>

          <p>Well, I was hoping this time would come, but I didn't expect it to be so soon. But, if Traufnir says you're ready, then I believe that you're ready.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's my belief that while the student learns from the teacher, the teacher may also learn something from the student. I look forward to our partnership, [%username].</p>
