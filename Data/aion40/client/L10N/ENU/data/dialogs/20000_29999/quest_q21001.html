          <p>Nothing seems to be going our way lately!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just the other day I found some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21001a] at a nearby Drana farm. I assumed the Balaur must have been using them, so I ordered my men to store them for further investigation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And then I got busy--there's so much going on here. So it's probably no surprise that I completely forgot about the parts and left them unguarded....</p>

          <p>Yes, [%username]. It was only this morning that I remembered, and I immediately sent a legionary to check on them. But it was too late--the parts were gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Right now we don't know any more than that. I can only assume they were stolen. The only clue is that there were some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Merdion_DR_51_n]s wandering about in the area. Looking very hungry, I'm told....</p>

          <p>Do you think it's possible? It's just a theory, but I'd heard that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Merdion_DR_51_n]s are gluttonous omnivores.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must do something! If rumor spreads that I lost all those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21001a], things will go badly for me. Do you have time to give me a hand?</p>

          <p>Excellent! It'll be easy to tell if my theory is valid. Snufflers have weak stomachs, so if hold them upside down and shake them, the parts should fall right out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there are a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21001a] missing. Please, don't come back until you've found them all.</p>

          <p>So you think there's no way that Snufflers could devour those parts? Do you have a better theory, [%username]? If so, I'd like to hear it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure that's what happened. The parts are gone, the Snufflers are nearby. It all fits.</p>
