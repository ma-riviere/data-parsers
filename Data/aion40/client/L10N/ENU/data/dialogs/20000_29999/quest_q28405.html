          <p>Perhaps I can restore more of the marble. If we can see the process for turning a normal Drakan into a Guardian General....</p>

          <p>All right. I've managed to wring out a little bit more.</p>

          <p>After Kexkra is attacked by the Elyos, he collapses from his injuries. Too damaged to protest, Surama's men drag him to a lab and inject him with Dragel.</p>

          <p>Please deliver this to Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dmytro] in the Gelkmaros Fortress. Maybe he can restore more and add to our understanding of Balaur technology.</p>
