          <p>Nothing difficult. I just need this order delivered to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vyuin] at the Antagor Guard Post.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Chairman Vellun has asked me to stay here until his research is finished, but this letter must be sent as soon as possible. It's official business, I'm told. From Pandaemonium, probably.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Thank you. Just give this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vyuin]. It's a sealed order, and it should only be opened by him.</p>

          <p>Can I help you? You don't look like one of our legion...or any other major one I know of, from your armor. Are you a Field Warden?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess it doesn't matter--I'll tell you what I tell everyone--avoid wandering around by yourself. Even this close to the fortress, the Balaur have been attacking almost every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, with my balfired bad luck, they'll attack any second now....</p>

          <p>A sealed order? Curious....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems I've been ordered to the Gelkmaros Defense Base, by...ah, Pandaemonium. I can't abandon my post here, though--it would fall to the Balaur instantly....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I see. They're sending a replacement. I wonder why they don't just send the replacement there. Curious. Maybe...ah, yes. I see. Things are finally in motion....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, nothing you should worry about. I suppose I'll get ready. Thank you for delivering this. I hope it wasn't too inconvenient.</p>

          <p>Vyuin said it was an order of dispatch to the Gelkmaros Defense Base. He began preparations to leave as soon as his replacement arrives.</p>
