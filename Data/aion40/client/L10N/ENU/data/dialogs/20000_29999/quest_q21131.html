          <p>Both the Vorgaltem Citadel and the Crimson Temple have fallen to our enemies!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we still have one last trick up our sleeve. Lord Marchutan's own exarch, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_3111_Boss_Da_1], has just arrived and will unleash the wrath of the Shedim Lords...but we need to buy him some time.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_3111_Boss_Da_1] is slaughtering our enemies as we speak, but he needs the support of Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to bless Mastarius's Aether Concentrator and increase the exarch's powers. It's tempting to fight at his side, but the exarch wields the might of the Empyrean Lords--we're better off standing back and supporting him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This has to happen soon, or the exarch won't have enough power to overthrow our enemies! Get to Gelkmaros Defense Base now!</p>

          <p>When [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_3111_Boss_Da_1] is under attack from our enemies, channel the Blessing of Devotion into Mastarius's Aether Concentrator. With 100 blessings, the exarch will summon the Empyrean Avatar and lay waste to these encroaching mongrels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Channel the Blessing of Devotion at least 10 times, and we will purge Gelkmaros of our enemies in the name of Lord Marchutan! Go now! There's no time to waste!</p>

          <p>I still don't know how we lost the Vorgaltem Citadel and the Crimson Temple, but it's good to know that we have Daevas like you to prevent us from losing Gelkmaros altogether.</p>
