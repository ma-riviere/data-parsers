          <p>Oh, they're cute and all, but I've been ordered to clear the area of hazards before I relieve Denskel at Krug Waterfall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already diverted some of the dangerous currents, removed sharp rocks, and disarmed Balaur traps. But there are still the Mookies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are so many, you can't help but get in their way, and they tend to be territorial.</p>

          <p>Hah! I see what you did there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seriously though, the best thing I can think to do is reduce their numbers so it's easier to relocate the whole poke of Mookies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But these [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_51_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_Big_51_An]s are everywhere! Think you could help out a bit?</p>

          <p>Great! Between the two of us, we can clear out quite a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_51_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Fungy_DR_Big_51_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, they'll be easier to wrangle then. There are quite a few on the path to the Cursed Tree Forest too. Good hunting!</p>
