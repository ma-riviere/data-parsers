          <p>We have been pressing Tiamat very hard--she is starting to fear us. But even this good result has led to obstacles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She is pouring ever more power into opposing us. We have been finding ways past, but it has been difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our Alchemists have just recently come up with a possible weapon: a potion that draws on the same power as the Hearts to fuel our Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it needs to be tested. I would like you to go to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_ItemUseArea_Q12066A] and drink this Experimental Potion. Tell me whether it works or not.</p>

          <p>I wish to assure you, [%username], that I do not consider you, or any other Daeva, a mere lab rat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would not have agreed to this had I not been assured that the potion would not harm, whether it worked or not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also would not have agreed had it not had so much potential. Did you try it? Did it work?</p>

          <p>That is good news! The generals at Pandaemonium will be very pleased!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's just a shame the potion can't be used elsewhere. But maybe with some work, and a little time.... I pray to Aion we have that time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if we can mass-produce these potions, we will have a significant advantage over Balaur and Elyos. Good job!</p>

          <p>Skafir needed you to test a potion developed by Pandaemonium's alchemists. It would only work in one of the Heart fortresses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to one of the Hearts and drank the potion. It worked, much to your and Skafir's delight.</p>
