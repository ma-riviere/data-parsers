          <p>Centurion Gelastra ordered me to bring an urgent letter to Faruth in the Krug Basin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said that I should use a Windstream at Dragonrest to get there faster, but I'm not really comfortable with that means of travel. What I mean is I'm scared to death, basically.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you maybe take the letter to Faruth for me, [%username]? I would really appreciate it.</p>
