          <p>Now, it's time to bring down the curtain on this little drama.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I shall write a letter to Shawster explaining my deductions, and what I think should be done next.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I'm doing that, do you have any thoughts on this case?</p>

          <p>Ah, very intelligent. I also dislike speaking of my deductions before they're confirmed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's the letter. Please deliver it to Shawster personally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and be sure to let him know Centurion Brynhild will contact him soon.</p>

          <p>I would like to request you not open the letter. Wouldn't want [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Homesiane] to think it'd been tampered with, now do we?</p>

          <p>Return here after you make the delivery. On your way back, muse on the case. I'll explain all when you come back.</p>

          <p>Pity. It's an attitude that is alien to me. I cannot imagine not seeing a case through to the end.</p>

          <p>But I suppose there is more at stake out there than a few individual lives. My thanks for your work.</p>

          <p>Heh. Hahahahaha! I knew I shouldn't have underestimated him! So his reputation truly is deserved!</p>

          <p>I suppose there's no use hiding it anymore. Give Shorleck my congratulations, and tell him it's where Skraw dwells.</p>

          <p>I see you understand the truth now. Yes, Shawster is responsible for Iliene's disappearance, and Maron's as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An old man with a young wife and a handsome assistant about her age.... A volatile combination. His story was a lie, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is what gave him away. The grass was trodden on, not by a woman's foot, but by something much heavier...like an artificial leg. And the stains he left behind resembled blood but were actually an herbal dye made from plants only found near Shawster's home.</p>

          <p>The Gryphu there will rip them apart. Centurion Brynhild must be told to search that area at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All in all, Shawster's biggest mistake was hiring me in order to divert suspicion. And turning to you to be his messenger. I thank you for your able assistance.</p>

          <p>Shorleck announced that he had solved the case. He asked you to take a letter containing his findings to his client, Shawster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Shawster read the letter, he behaved very oddly. He told you to give Shorleck a cryptic message. When you returned to Shorleck, he confirmed that Shawster was behind his wife's and assistant's disappearances.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He thanked you, and also told you that the area mentioned by Shawster had to be searched for signs of the missing couple.</p>
