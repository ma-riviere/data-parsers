          <p>Were you curious about that Piece of Zikel? It's much deeper than it appears. Great power often is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Its potential is limitless, but it remains potential until it's actively used and nurtured.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My point, of course, is that you won't be able to unlock greater powers in the dagger I gave you with just the Piece.</p>

          <p>That's correct. Well, not you, actually; you don't have the skills necessary. No offense meant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The experience, dicipline, and ingenuity needed to use the Piece of Zikel to its fullest are extremely rare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is only one person I know of with all the qualities necessary, and who'd be willing to take on this task.</p>

          <p>Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener]. You might have seen her around Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, this work is so intensive that I doubt she'll do it for free. You must be prepared for that.</p>

          <p>You won't regret your decision. At the very least, you should see what she has to say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even the smallest increase in power could make the difference in a battle, and thus, the entire war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Keep the dagger and the Piece of Zikel close to your chest, Daeva. I hope you realize just how precious they are.</p>

          <p>That is a shame. I'm sure you could've used the extra power that the Piece of Zikel could give your dagger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I apologize for not being able to offer additional help, but I must think of all Daevas fighting this war, not just one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, Kinah can at least be earned. Be sure to see me again should you feel comfortable with spending it.</p>

          <p>Ahem. Sorry, that was undignified of me. But you have to understand, using a Piece of Zikel is every smith's dream.</p>

          <p>I'd be happy to work on them. Unfortunately, it'll require special materials...expensive materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Altogether, they cost 8,000,000 Kinah. Yes, that's a lot, but I guarantee my results. Still interested?</p>

          <p>I do paid business off and on, but a lot of what I do is on my own, so I don't have the Kinah either.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>That was difficult, but so worth it. I've never handled such power before. Hopefully, it's not the last time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Try out Athana's Dagger now. I think you'll find your Kinah very well spent.</p>
