          <p>In short, the Balaur have found a way to unlock a further stigma slot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their tests were successful on the Mau, the Krall, and the Dragonbound. The fact that the tests were successful on the Dragonbound interests us most, for obvious reasons....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They actually describe the process here in significant detail. I could apply it you, if you're interested....</p>

          <p>Good! I was hoping you would say yes!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur documented their research brilliantly, as it turns out. You wouldn't think that lot could start a campfire, the way they fight, but they're smart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, just give me a moment or two to prepare myself....</p>

          <p>It's Balaur research, [%username]! I don't want to sound like too big a fan, but they've mastered a number of complicated process relating to Stigma, and I believe this is no different.</p>
