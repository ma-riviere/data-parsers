          <p>Great Aion, they don't know when to quit. You'd think the thrashing we gave them would teach them a lesson....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, [%username]. I was just thinking about those Balaur who destroyed the Sapien village. It seems they're still lurking about.</p>

          <p>If we weren't deadly enemies, I could admire their tenacity, as stupid as it may be.</p>

          <p>Their activity and numbers are increasing. My superiors are concerned they're planning to take over the area as a base of operations.</p>

          <p>Exactly! I like the way you think, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Balaur base at that village would seriously hamper future movement in this region. I've gotten orders to prevent that by any means necessary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But look around you. I have to deal with the Sapiens and Reians here, not to mention coordinating patrols. Can you go in and take out the Balaur in my stead?</p>

          <p>Make sure to steal [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21052a] from the Balaur you defeat. They're rations, so if the Balaur get hungry, they'll clear out sooner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might take more than one raid to send them packing, so to repay you for your trouble I can get you a top notch set of gloves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring 50,000 Kinah for Shugo fees, I can get the ball rolling on that. In the meantime, happy Balaur hunting!</p>

          <p>Look, I know these are Sapiens and all, but they lost a lot when the Balaur drove them out. They're suffering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If their old home gets taken over as a Balaur base, they'll suffer even more, as will we Asmodians.</p>

          <p>Otherwise, the survivors will just pick it off the corpses, and they'll have enough food to dig in no matter what we do.</p>

          <p>Disgusting stuff, that Dratamin. If any Human or Sapien tried to eat it.... Well, I don't know anyone who's tried, but I can't imagine anyone keeping it down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll make sure it's destroyed. Those Balaur will be short manpower and resources, thanks to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If those gloves came in, they're yours. In the meantime, I'll need you to conduct more raids in the future. At the rate you're going, though, the Balaur won't last long!</p>
