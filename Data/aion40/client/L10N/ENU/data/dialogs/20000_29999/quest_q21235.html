          <p>I ask Rocayd to do a task fit for a recruit, and does he complete it? Of course not! That would make life at the Temple of Scales just a little too simple!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Aion's grace...one of these days I will send all these milksop dimwits back to their mommies and daddies in Pandaemonium and replace them with scarecrows. Then at least I will have guards standing at their posts!</p>

          <p>Ugh, I have to wonder if Krizarid has to deal with this kind of nonsense in Gelkmaros. He keeps track of all his kills, and I'm behind by...oh I don't know, about two or three...thousand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Granted, he's my older brother, but I'll never catch up while I'm stationed here as a blasted nanny to a bunch of sniveling children!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, what are you still standing there for? If you want to help, I need Serrator Scales to reinforce our armor. If you can't handle it, then get out of my sight!</p>

          <p>Look around this area for the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2_LF4_C_DragonSnake_55_An]s and collect their scales. The beasts are weak, but the Elyos and the Balaur are not. Don't let the cowards ambush you while you're out there hunting.</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]! While you were out, I was able to take a welcome bloodbath! Yes, both Elyos and Balaur fell in droves, their corpses wilted and picked over by carrion and scavengers alike! It was glorious.</p>
