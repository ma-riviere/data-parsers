          <p>- Combat Orders -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While Fundin the Fearless is omnipotent, I am not omnipresent. It often falls to ordinary Daevas to protect Asmodae's citizens and smite our enemies while I am not present.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I, Fundin the Fearless, am being magnificent somewhere else, the Elyos garrison commanders [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q03], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q04], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_Gateway_Li_Guard_Boss_Q05] are always wreaking havoc. Therefore, I issue a kill order on those heathens to be enacted once our garrison has fallen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill the Elyos commanders and return to me for a handsome reward.</p>

          <p>[%username]...that combat order you carry.... Why, I issued it eons ago, and none have come to collect the reward.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I, Fundin the Fearless, even thought to carry it out myself at one point! But it wouldn't be a fair fight--there is no honor in crushing insects. But one like you could not hope to understand the logic of one as powerful as Fundin the Fearless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I am prepared to offer a Noble Earring as a reward if the order has been carried out. Except...it will cost a little extra...say 15,000,000 Kinah. Well then, have the commanders been slain?</p>

          <p>This Noble Earring is no insignificant trinket, [%username]. Wielding items such as this, even a Daeva like you could become as powerful as Fundin the Fearless one day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, that's not true, but it's important to reach for the sky, I always say. Rest assured, 15,000,000 Kinah is a trifling amount compared to the power of this Noble Earring.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reconsider if you must, otherwise I will take the 15,000,000 Kinah.</p>

          <p>This Noble Earring is a family heirloom, and it's difficult to part with it...but alas, Fundin the Fearless has no need for such baubles.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Return if you ever manage to scrounge up the coin. Otherwise, I will continue to safeguard this relic.</p>
