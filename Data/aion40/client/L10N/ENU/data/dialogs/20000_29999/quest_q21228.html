          <p>Blast! We've lost the Vorgaltem Citadel! How could Krizarid let this happen? I've heard the Archons whispering that Krizarid never sleeps, he only waits.... But perhaps that's just a rumor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nonetheless, we need to control that citadel or Gelkmaros Defense Base will be at risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our enemies are closing in, and it's not just the Balaur--the Elyos are here as well.</p>

          <p>It's not going to be easy, [%username]. We'll need all the strength Asmodae can muster.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Empyrean Lord Marchutan's legion is there, as is the Pandaemonium Expeditionary Force, but even their numbers won't defeat the Guardian General alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I need you to gather a force and march on the Vorgaltem Citadel. The Guardian General must die.</p>

          <p>I've sent several Daevas to the citadel already. Hopefully they're still alive and able to aid you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_21228] or this will go south in a hurry.</p>

          <p>Once you've captured the Citadel, make sure to find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Krizarid]. Just don't accuse him of sleeping on the job...unless you don't value your limbs....</p>
