          <p>I have to admit, I get depressed whenever I look around this place. Depressed and angry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They may be Sapiens, but most of them have lost as much as we have to the Balaur. Some even more. And they suffer just as acutely as Humans do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some escaped experimentation in Tiamat's laboratories, or have been on the run for months, starving. It's enough to make my blood boil.</p>

          <p>I agree completely. But it'll be hard, partly because they don't really trust us yet. With all they've been through, I don't blame them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is a Shulack named Chenkiki who has reached out to Asmodians quite often. She serves as a kind of intermediary between us and the other refugees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As such, when she approached me earlier with a request, there really wasn't a way I could refuse....</p>

          <p>Yes. She wants [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Remain_Q21104]s cleared from the Nunglark Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, the refugees strongly believe they'll return home one day soon, and want their streets and homes clear when they come back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's still dangerous there, but I'd like you to take this request. I have reasons for wanting it done.</p>

          <p>Let me explain--the Sapiens have lived in Gelkmaros for generations now. They may hold valuable information that none of us sees as important yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also have officers who can examine the debris for valuable information on the Balaur, like the composition of their weapons, the magic they use, and so on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when you clear the debris, gather the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Remain_Q21104]s you find. This will increase the refugees' trust in us, and get us intel at the same time.</p>

          <p>I know what you're thinking--I used to think it too. I thought all Sapiens were Balaur worshippers not worth a shard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But being here, seeing their hopes, their suffering.... It's affected every Asmodian stationed here. I know it's affected me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stay here for a while, talk to these lost souls. I know you'll be changed too, and will return to take my request.</p>

          <p>There's advantage to being in the midst of enemy territory. Besides having more foes to slaughter, of course. They're liable to be careless about small things, little signs, that could give up valuable information if interpreted correctly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's what I hope we can get from the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Remain_Q21104]s.</p>

          <p>Hrm.... Perhaps you didn't see the value in a seemingly worthless pile of trash, but don't judge so quickly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Besides, as I said, the refugees don't trust us. They may not believe we did anything without physical evidence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you see, coming back with [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Remain_Q21104]s is doubly important. Do not return until you do.</p>

          <p>Skira hoped that by honoring the refugees' request to clear debris from the Nunglark Ruins, they could gain their trust, and valuable information.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to the village and brought back fragments of debris. Skira could feel the power of Drana that she once sensed in Dark Poeta, and believed there could be a connection.</p>
