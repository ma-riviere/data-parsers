          <p>For all their savagery, the Balaur are such fascinating creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their technology--Drana, the Dredgion, the rift they opened in Dark Poeta...it's simply astounding! The Balaur might appear crude, but their aptitude for technology rivals that of even the shrewdest Shugo tinkerers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To have any hope of defeating the Balaur, we need to know more about them. Don't you agree, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Yes! Knowing is half the battle, I always say. I just wish my little brother Itar was more concerned with knowledge. Our family has produced a dozen renowned scholars, but sometimes I think he just doesn't have it in him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, that's neither here nor there. While I was out in the field protecting naive little Itar from the fierce beasts of Balaurea, I noticed an abandoned Drana Growing Device in the Dragonrest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to get my hands on it.</p>

          <p>It's too dangerous to take Itar there with me, and I couldn't leave him here alone. Perhaps you could fetching it for me, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring it back here, and I might be able to learn how the Balaur operate it. Then we Asmodians will be able to use it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this works, I'll gain renown from Lady Lumiel, and bring glory to our entire family! I fear I'm our only hope.... Poor Itar just lacks the conviction of a true scholar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, what do you think? Will you help me?</p>

          <p>Excellent! Head to the Dragonrest and locate the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_RuinedDranaSuction_Q21214]. The device itself is too big to move, but its power generator should be a superb specimen.</p>

          <p>Yes, all shall know the name of Tanar! Well, and his little brother Itar, who made many discoveries but always lived in the shadow of true greatness.</p>
