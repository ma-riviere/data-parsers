          <p>Ready for the next mission already? Hah, excellent! I admire your energy and courage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've gotten reports that the Balaur have created a new servant species to work places like the Twilight Drana Farm. We're calling them Dracuni for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They vaguely resemble Klaws, so we dismissed them at first. However, these creatures are the main labor used to cultivate Drana.</p>

          <p>Precisely. Your mind is sharp as well, I see. Good--Asmodae needs all the sharp minds we can get.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without their workers, the Drana will go ungathered. They lose their power and eventually crumble to dust. That is what we want. That is what your mission entails.</p>

          <p>When you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drakan_WorkerFi_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drakan_WorkerRa_55_An]s, take their pincers. My superiors want them examined to determine how Dracunis are created and how they handle Drana safely.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of my superiors, they're watching us both closely for this mission. Remember that--you do not bear just your personal safety on your shoulders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Leave as soon as you're ready. I will await good tidings.</p>

          <p>You understimate the importance of Drana to the Balaur cause. Their victory or defeat is not determined wholly on the battlefield, but also because of places like the Twilight Drana Farm.</p>

          <p>It is important to eradicate [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drakan_WorkerFi_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Drakan_WorkerRa_55_An]s, but we still need their pincers for study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I'm sorry, but please go back and get the Dracuni Pincers. You should hurry, before the Balaur remove the bodies.</p>

          <p>Thanks to you, we've finished our mission at the Twilight Drana Farm. We'll stay to continue observation, but our active work is done.</p>
