          <p>This is not a good time to be here, [%username]. Those blasted Balaur at the Naduka Biolab are messing with us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How? Bees! I've seen them myself. We were already warned by an Archon named Vyuin that the Balaur were experimenting with bees.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Come to think of it, ours showed up not long after he left. That's some coincidence....</p>

          <p>At any rate, we knew something was wrong when they showed up. Bees aren't exactly common in this region, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Olga is saying they're "messengers of the tippled jesters," whatever that means. They've been hovering nearby, but haven't attacked...yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand they're faster, more aggressive, and have strong venom. We need your help to get rid of them NOW.</p>

          <p>Listen carefully. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF4_SZ_C5_Lab] is in the deep end of the Petralith Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have no real idea what the Balaur are doing there...or to what. So I wouldn't go in unprepared.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll hunker down in the meantime in case the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_W_C5_Bee_DR_lab_55_An]s attack again. We're counting on you.</p>

          <p>Fine. I'll send for reinforcements from Pandaemonium. They'll feel out what's at the Biolab first before we do anything more.</p>

          <p>We'll play it your way for now, [%username]. I just hope we don't get stung to death before something gets done.</p>

          <p>Good. I think you just spared us a lot of hard hours of attack and defense. With foes as small as bees, it would've been tough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine what it would've been like had their numbers grown even more. And the Biolab would've done it--count on it.</p>

          <p>You did us a good deed today, [%username]. I won't forget it, and neither will anyone I talk to.</p>

          <p>Helline is concerned by Massive Bee Swarms that have been seen nearby. She theorized that they were the product of the Naduka Biolab.</p>

          <p>She sent you to the Biolab to get rid of the bees on their home turf, before they become a major threat.</p>

          <p>You went to the Naduka Biolab and wiped out the bees. Helline told you that you probably saved her and her troops a great deal of grief.</p>
