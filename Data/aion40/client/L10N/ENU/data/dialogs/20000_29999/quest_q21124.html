          <p>I've been looking over this blueprint you brought, and it's even more remarkable than I first thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you read the back? The note there is signed "Derren."</p>

          <p>Very. Derren the Hypnotist is the reason so many of my bretheren have joined the Dragonbound. Senegal, Hildisvini's lover, is another of his victims.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragonbound's ranks cannot grow further. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_FanaticPr_NmdQ_54_Ae] must be stopped.</p>

          <p>According to the note on the back, the location marked with an X is [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_FanaticPr_NmdQ_54_Ae]'s lab.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not take him lightly. Just because he deals with the mind doesn't mean he can't fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He will also be accompanied by brainwashed Dragonbound at all times, so be ready.</p>

          <p>I am surprised--I would have thought a Daeva like you would jump at the chance to slow the growth of the Dragonbound.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I can understand that you may not want to fight his victims. Aion knows we have had the same problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps another Daeva will be sufficiently detatched. Thank you for listening to my request.</p>

          <p>The Dragonbound won't stop their foul recruitment because of one death, of course, but you have hampered their efforts severely.</p>

          <p>Ortiz knew that name well as a man who had brainwashed many of his fellow Reians. Killing Derren would deal a severe blow to the Dragonbound.</p>
