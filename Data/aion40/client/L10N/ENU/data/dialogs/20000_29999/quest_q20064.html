          <p>It's finally time. After all these years, all these centuries, we can finally fight back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Before we enter, we must make sure we're prepared. We all saw what Tiamat did to your forces before. No-one could blame you that time, but if more lives are needlessly lost now, then that will be blood on your hands, friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You and I will scout the area and meet with the others already there, if they're still alive.</p>

          <p>So far, one Reian unit and one Asmodian unit have left for Tiamaranta's Eye. They will soon be joined by an elite Elyos unit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to go to Tiamaranta's Eye and join up with the Asmodian unit there. Your superiors sent the Fatebound Legion, led by [%dic:STR_DIC_N_LDF4b_Q20064_Boss_Dark]. It is she that you need to meet with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be leaving shortly myself to reinforce the Reian scout unit. Any questions?</p>

          <p>Our scouts have found little so far. No sign at all of that blasted Dragon Lord! Maybe now, with you at our side, we'll have better luck, eh?</p>

          <p>This is terrible! The Balaur are not normally this strong, [%username]. If this is indicative of their general strength, then we need to rethink our entire strategy here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll head back now, [%username]. I must report this to the council. In the meantime, the Balaur come. Prepare yourself.</p>

          <p>As you Asmodians say, blast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We clearly need to prepare better before assaulting Tiamaranta's Eye. This will take time and considerable patience, and it will stretch your peace accord to its limits. I only pray that it holds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I was to offer you a weapon for completing the task, but there's no sense in letting it go to waste. Please, take your pick, and know that we truly appreciate all that you've done.</p>

          <p>Garnon told you that it was finally time to go to Tiamaranta's Eye, and invited you to go and meet with the Fatebound Legion. You arrived, only for an unexpected showdown with an Elyos Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon saw what happened but was soon forced to retreat when a Balaur Legion, led by Tiamat himself, emerged from the stronghold and attacked.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You reported back to Adella, who was saddened by the events and warned that the operation would take much longer than initially expected.</p>
