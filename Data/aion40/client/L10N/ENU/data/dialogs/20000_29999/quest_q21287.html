	<p>Brought any goblets for me to look over, [%username]? Remember: the better the quality, the better your reward.</p>

	<p>Hah. Lesser Ancient Goblets can barely hold water, never mind value. Still, I'm required to take them in, and reward you for them.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Remember, though, you'll get a much better reward for higher grade goblets. Hopefully you'll have some next time I see you, eh?</p>

	<p>Hmm, not bad, [%username]. Not bad.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Ancient Goblets like these each tell their own story. Our ancestors used to tell tales via images, you see. It's a shame this goblet is so dented, because I can just about make out Zikel here.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Anyway, thanks for your work. Use your reward well!</p>

	<p>So you have! Interesting, isn't it? These designs, I mean.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The goblets are ancient, likely made right after the Cataclysm, yet the motifs are similar to the Reian quirks you see in their creations. Different trees with the same roots, eh?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Here's your reward, soldier. Good work.</p>

	<p>Well, stone the Shulacks, so you have! The researchers don't have a grade higher than major, and it's not often that we see items that warrant the classification.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These goblets will keep Pandaemonium busy for a good while, hopefully. Thank you.</p>

	<p>The Pandaemonium Treasury's put an order out for an unspecified amount of Ancient items. That means they'll take as many as you can bring me, [%username], and the rewards are well worth the effort.</p>
