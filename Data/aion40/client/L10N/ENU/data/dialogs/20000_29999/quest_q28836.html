          <p>I want to plant this sprout right away! However, I cannot. You see, not every home gardener can make a Bloom grow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are very sensitive plants in their early stages. The slightest mistake can keep them a sprout forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the keys is the soil. I'll need Patamor Soil. You'll find it carried by monsters in Patamor Thicket.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could go there and get enough for the Sprout, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

          <p>When I was a child, I lived in a Studio with my parents. When we got our first house, our first new decoration was a Guestbloom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been fascinated with them ever since. Especially since they're so common, yet still so mysterious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once I get your Sprout growing in the Patamor Soil, I hope to learn a lot.</p>

          <p>Ah, yes! Do you smell that musky scent? Oh... I suppose it's not for everyone, is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, yes, this will be enough. The Sprout should be able to grow full and hearty thanks to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I'll be with it every step of the way to observe and study.... Also thanks to you.</p>

          <p>Aridella needed fertile soil to cultivate the Guestbloom Sprout you gave her.</p>

          <p>You collected Patamor Soil while hunting in Patamor Thicket. Aridella thanked you gratefully.</p>
