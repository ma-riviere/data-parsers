          <p>So I was here yesterday and chatting with this refugee, right? And he says, "I swear by Siel's Spear. A pretty flower tried to eat me not five minutes ago."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's kind of ridiculous, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I told him I'd do something about it. So, would you go kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_Fellial_DR_56_An]s nearby so I can tell him you did?</p>

          <p>Refugee coordinating is all about hanging out with the neat Daevas who show up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like finding Siel's Spear in a discarded weapons pile.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like this: "Kahrun's eye! It's [%username] again." I love this job.</p>

          <p>Really?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That refugee must've been telling the truth, instead of exaggerating. But we all know how that can go, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One minute, you're telling your legion-mates about how you fought a Nojolf. Next minute, it's forty Drakan-spawn riding overgrown Nojolfs.</p>

          <p>Samuz said he'd met a refugee who got too close to a Gravel Moonflower... and nearly got eaten!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To set the refugee's mind at ease, you destroyed Gravel Moonflowers, then told Samuz all about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Samuz was surprised to hear how dangerous the plants really were and was impressed by your hunting.</p>
