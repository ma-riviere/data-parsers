          <p>As it happens, I've received some interesting news from the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1], and I hope it has a bearing on our investigation. There've been sightings of some strange phenomena they're calling [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4a_Monster_M_Aurora_58_An].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm betting that you can extract some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10072a] from them, and that will help us track Lord Israphel. I don't want to tell you any more than that, in case Garnon or Kahrun ask. That way you won't have to lie to them.</p>

          <p>Ah, good. This looks like exactly what the sorcerers were talking about.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're saying that we can combine the two different energy signatures--the one from the Throne of Blood, and the one from the Anaz Forest--to create a dimensional gate leading to... wherever it was that Lord Israphel went.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians have been very helpful to us. We won't forget that, angry though they may be in the end.</p>

          <p>Please don't ask me to explain this, since I'm not a sorcerer. However, I have detailed instructions and I know exactly how to activate this energy and send you to Lord Israphel's hiding place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The most important mission, of course, is to get Siel's Relics back. Lord Marchutan is counting on you for that. However, there's also another consideration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Israphel is an Empyrean Lord. There must be some good still in him. And you two have history. Perhaps you'll be able to talk him around.</p>

          <p>I'm sure you've heard the history of how the Dragon Lords rose up against their creator, [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA02], and tried to become gods themselves. That's why Aion created the twelve Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We created the Aetheric Field to defend the tower, but it just prolonged the tedious stalemate. The Humans and Daevas began to laugh at us and turn away from our teachings, since the twelve of us together couldn't defeat our five enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was sick of my comrades' inaction. I'd suggested many plans, but they rejected each one, afraid of war and pain and loss. I knew that those things would only get worse if we didn't do something decisive. Besides, I knew how to absorb the power from the Tower of Eternity and use it.</p>

          <p>I'm disappointed; I didn't think you had such a small mind. I needed that power to put down the Dragon Lords for good. All we needed to do was to lure them near the tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told the other Empyreans that we were holding a peace conference. Then, I went to [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA51] and convinced it that it could take this opportunity to crush the Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA49] had plans of its own, and destroyed the Tower of Eternity. As the Cataclysm happened all around us, I let the others think I was helping Siel to maintain the Aetheric Field, but I knew there was no point in sacrificing myself as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might call me a coward, but I am a pragmatist. I had another plan--one which it has taken me this long to orchestrate.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the new Atreia will need a leader. We've seen where so many voices would lead us, and it's clear that one voice must ring out clearer and louder than the others. We only need one Empyrean Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is my chance to redeem myself! I will lead Atreia into a golden age, and steer everyone onto the right path.</p>

          <p>You tried to destroy the relics and stop his plan, but he swatted you aside easily. Just when things seemed lost, the spirit of Lady Siel appeared. She embraced Lord Israphel and the relics, destroying them both.</p>
