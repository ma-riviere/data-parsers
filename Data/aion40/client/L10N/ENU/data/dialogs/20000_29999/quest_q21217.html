          <p>Aha! I've discovered what went wrong with the last experiment!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first I thought it was Tanar's fault for tampering with the magic stones...which still might be true. However, I also discovered that the stones did capture Tiamat's power, just as we expected!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It wasn't the formulas that were incorrect, it was our execution. I'm positive that our next experiment will be a success...but to do it, I need more magic stones to replace those you broke.</p>

          <p>Oh no, I told you to do it. I thought breaking the stones was the best way to measure the release of Tiamat's power, but it turns out that my equipment was the problem!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The power released from breaking even one stone was colossal. My equipment didn't react to it because it was ten times the amount I expected!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To replace the stones, I need more funding from the Pandaemonium Research Center. But I can't leave Tanar here, and he might get in trouble if I took him with me. Could you take my report to Chairman Vellun at the fortress, [%username]?</p>

          <p>The probability that the experiment would fail last time was low...and doing it again will cost a fortune.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the cost is a small sacrifice if we can discover the secret behind Tiamat's power. Hurry to Chairman [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Wolfgang] and hand him that report. </p>

          <p>Tanar and Itar.... Those two... I've never heard so much bickering in my life, but their minds are brilliant, and their research is rock solid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is...the experiment failed?! We poured enough Kinah into that experiment to fill a warehouse! And now they want more? Wait...so they think they've discovered the secret behind Tiamat's power....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This proposal is fascinating, but I can't allocate these kinds of funds without approval. Please show this to Great Scholar [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fjoersvith] in Pandaemonium, then get the approval of Brigade General [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Barretta].</p>

          <p>Ah, Itar! One of the brightest minds I've ever encountered. Tanar has his moments as well...though he is a bit pompous.</p>

          <p>Hmmm.... Interesting report. I always appreciated Itar's willingness to leap before he looks--it's something many scholars lack. He reminds me of myself at a younger age.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Itar's experiment is still a little risky, but not enough for Brigade General Valetta to deny it. No great innovations come without cost. Very well, I'll sign off on it. Take this to the Brigade General.</p>

          <p>Well, I see the Great Scholar has signed off on this, so even if I wanted to deny it, I couldn't now. Very well, I'll have this processed. I just hope we aren't wasting our resources.</p>
