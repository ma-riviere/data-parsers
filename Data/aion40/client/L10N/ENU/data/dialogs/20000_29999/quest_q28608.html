          <p>Wait, [%username]. About Kromede's Tear....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, it's a fine necklace, but because of its origin, there's a lot more you can do with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It has a special connection with a particular weapon wielded by Kromede.</p>

          <p>Well, if you get this weapon, the Sword of the Judge, I can fuse the necklace to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The result is a much more powerful weapon. It takes a talented blacksmith to do this, but I think I can do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need to do is get the Sword of the Judge. Interested?</p>

          <p>Woo! This'll be a great way to prove my skills to the world. I won't let you down, I promise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need to do is get the Sword of the Judge. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] herself still has it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's hiding out in Morheim's Fire Temple. I don't expect that she'll give the sword up easily, though.</p>

          <p>You doubt my skills? Or do you just like the necklace that much?</p>

          <p>It is nice, I admit. But I think the improved Sword of the Judge might help you even more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you have the necklace, and I have my skill. No feathers off anyone's wings if you want to wait.</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you get the Sword of the Judge? I can go ahead and do the fusion, if that's the case.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, it was a challenge...I'll say that. It might even have been a little difficult. But I pulled it off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, try it for yourself. It's a little lighter now, isn't it? Be sure to tell your friends who did this excellent work, will ya?</p>
