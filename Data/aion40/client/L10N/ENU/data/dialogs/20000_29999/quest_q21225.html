          <p>Enjoy your time here. Our presence here is a great victory for Asmodae, but victory must be maintained, not just achieved. Even now, the Balaur and Elyos seek to drive us away once more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strength and vigilance must be our watchwords.</p>

          <p>But of course. Yet even our victorious position emperils us. Enemy presence outside has made getting supplies difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus, we are trying to be self-sufficient. Already we've sent out patrols to gather supplies.</p>

          <p>Good. I want you to hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Varanus_DR_54_An]s at Vorgaltem Battlefield and obtain their skins. Serrator skins can be used for armor, shelter, even medicine. That kind of utility is exactly what we need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let the enemy see our continued strength. Blood for blood!</p>

          <p>Keeping a conquered area isn't just a matter of battle and spell-slinging. You have to think about supplies, manpower....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I let Legionaries like Krizarid take care of the martial matters. My friends in Pandaemonium say that death didn't exist until he was born.</p>

          <p>I know the hunting can be poor, but you must put all your effort into this. We're counting on those skins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Varanus_DR_54_An]s in Vorgaltem Battlefield don't just give up their skins, true, but they are hardly Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd compare them more to Elyos, maybe? They are certainly equally pretty.</p>

          <p>These are quality skins. I'm already planning how best to use them.</p>

          <p>You did a fine job, [%username]. You've made it that much easier to hold this tower.</p>

          <p>But our need hasn't been sated, not by a long shot. If you can spare more time later, we'd really appreciate it.</p>
