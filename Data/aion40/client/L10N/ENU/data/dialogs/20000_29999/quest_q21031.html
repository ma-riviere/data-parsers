          <p>I'm here in Sunken Canyon looking for rare minerals.</p>

          <p>There are some large deposits of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_Amethyst_Q21031] buried here, which is fantastic. Antimoni is a rare mineral.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, not long ago I found this flawless Antimoni. It radiates a kind of eerie light, but I still find it enchanting. It's become rather...precious to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By Aion's grace...sometimes I think I hear it whispering, but surely I'm imagining it.</p>
