          <p>Thanks to you, I can actually work in the Dragonspine Rise without getting attacked by Gryphu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hardly see any these days. And if I do, some yelling and rock-throwing actually gets them to slink off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's like they know Skraw was killed by an Asmodian, so they're running scared of any Asmodian they see.</p>

          <p>Hah, exactly! Still, a new leader will emerge among the Gryphu sooner or later. It's just the way the world works.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Dragonspine Rise is so rich, I want to be surveying there for quite a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I think we need to take this opportunity to suppress the Gryphu population once and for all.</p>

          <p>There you go! Without Skraw around, the remaining [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Condor_DR_51_An]s should be easy pickings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once they're all gone, there won't be any leader, and it could take years for them to return. More than enough time for me to work.</p>

          <p>Used to be, especially when Skraw was around, that you'd hear infernal cawing all the way over here, constantly.</p>
