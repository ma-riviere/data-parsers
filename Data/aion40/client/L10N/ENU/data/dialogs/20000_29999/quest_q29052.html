          <p>Back when they called me "The Great Darfen," I'm sure I looked as you do: happy only when crafting furniture.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then the politics started and Rayot was the only one who stood beside me against the fools who thought... Well, never you mind what they thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The point is you have a talent, fated unto you by the Empyrean Lords. You should craft something that proves your talent.</p>

          <p>Yes! You need to progress, else the Lords will get angry for squandering their gift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must craft [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_D_SKILL_MENUI_299b]. It's a variation on a piece you may have made before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The key is to continue crafting until you come up with the higher-end item.</p>
