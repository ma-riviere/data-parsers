          <p>Since I've been here, we've tried everything to keep track of those sharding Balaur prisoners. But they keep disappearing without evidence of a breakout.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I even disguised our Daevas as Balaur and locked them up. But our decoys sit in their cells, while the real monsters go free.</p>

          <p>You're not the first to suggest that. A Reian tribesman spoke of a secret passage inside our fortress. That's it over there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I have to clear the investigation with Relyt before I go, or else he'll accuse me of taking a vacation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you start looking into things ahead of time, he can't fault me, can he?</p>
