          <p>Don't fuss, it's unbecoming. I just noticed your name on the list of Daevas who've been recognized for their distinguished service to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Empyrean Lord Marchutan decreed that those on the list are eligible for personal training in the Crucible Challenge, and knowing you... I figured you'd be interested.</p>

          <p>I figured as much. Opportunities like this are rare. The entrance to the Crucible Challenge is over there, by Mordan the Perpetually Cranky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are 6 stages to work through. I'm interested to see how far you get on your first attempt... do me proud, [%username]. I have Kinah riding on this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rules and regulations are the same as those in the Empyrean Crucible. To get credit for completing training, you have complete the 6th Stage and defeat Vanktrist Spacetwine.</p>
