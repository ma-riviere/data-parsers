          <p>The Sunken Canyon near the Dragonspine Rise--a fissure created by the power of Tiamat--is a source of many rare and useful minerals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Needless to say, Pandaemonium has taken quite an interest in the region. This is a rare opportunity to observe subterranean minerals and life forms we wouldn't normally have access to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested, [%username], I could use your help in this regard. We need to eradicate some dangerous creatures from the area--creatures which, as it turns out, can be harvested for Aether.</p>

          <p>Well, first you would need to acquire [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21041a]s from within the creatures. Then purchase a Disposable Aether Refining Device to refine the crystals into Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is quite a troublesome task, I understand, but you will be amply compensated. You will receive not only a Mithril coin, but something extra as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you willing and able to assist me?</p>

          <p>You will find an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21041a] within the body of each [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Mimic_Crk_52_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Vespa_Crk_52_An], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Kuillus_Crk_52_An], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Bookie_Crk_52_An] you slay.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They don't seem to have anything in common except for the fact that they were nearby when the fissure was first formed. No doubt this is why their bodies contain unstable Aether crystals. This is a good thing, though--it means they are not completely contaminated by Drana!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring me 15 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21041a]s and a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_d_redeem_jewelry_02a] to refine them, and you will receive a Mithril coin...and something extra.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will await your return.</p>
