          <p>We can use the Reian dead against the Balaur--and the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps it seems needlessly brutal, but this war is no place for weep-eyed formalities. There are Reian undead disturbed by something near Siel's Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are vicious, no longer truly our allies but monsters. More importantly, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_YunWi_Ghost_59_An]s carry [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_22018a]s. Those Crystals make powerful Godstones. The Legion needs them, [%username], so oblige us.</p>

          <p>Fighting the Undead... it is not something easily forgotten.</p>

          <p>Hopefully the Ghoulish Crystals will be worth your effort. You did get the Crystals, didn't you?</p>

          <p>Good.</p>

          <p>I need to figure out the best way to form the Crystals into Godstones, but once I do, I'll make sure they're distributed throughout the Legion.</p>

          <p>Hindla warned you that disturbed and angry Undead Reians wander the area around the Siel's Temple Ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She also told you that they carried valuable Crystals that could be turned into Godstones, so you collected some for the Legion.</p>
