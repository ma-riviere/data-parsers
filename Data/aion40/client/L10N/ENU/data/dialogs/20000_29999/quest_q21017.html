          <p>Those bees you killed looked odd, and I had a suspicion. So I sent some of them to Pandaemonium. I just got their reply.</p>

          <p>It's not just my luck--these are no ordinary bees! Each one is packed with Drana energy. The scholars theorized that they were bred that way by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that this was done in Dark Poeta as well. Even Sapiens have been altered this way for the Balaur's dark ends.</p>

          <p>I agree. No wonder they were only attacking me--and other Archons and Daevas, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, now that I've brought this to their attention, they want me to solve it by destroying the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_BeeNest_Q21017]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But frankly, the thought of facing those bees again... Do you think you could go in my stead?</p>

          <p>What a relief. With my luck, I know I'd mess up anyway.</p>

          <p>I think I saw a few [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_BeeNest_Q21017]s somewhere in Antagor Battlefield. Burn 'em, smash 'em, I don't care--just make sure everything in them is dead.</p>

          <p>Oho, so that's where they were. I guess the Drana makes the bees smarter as well as stronger. Not as smart or as strong as Asmodians, of course. Their defeat proves that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of this would be possible without you. I'll make sure Pandaemonium knows it too!</p>
