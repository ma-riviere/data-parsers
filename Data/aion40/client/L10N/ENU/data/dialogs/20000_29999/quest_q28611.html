          <p>By the way, what do you plan on doing with Kromede's Tear?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, I know you can just wear it. But there's a lot more behind that thing than looks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The materials I used have a special connection to Kromede.</p>

          <p>Well, not to Kromede herself, but to a weapon she wields...the Jewel of the Judge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can smelt the necklace and use it to coat the jewel. Its power will increase significantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have Kromede's Tear, obviously, so all you'd need to do is get the Jewel of the Judge. How about it?</p>

          <p>Ha, I wish the boys in Pandaemonium could see me now. First I get Dream Fragments, now this!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, right, the Jewel of the Judge. Actually, the real [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] still has it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard that she's in the Fire Temple in Morheim. Just remember, she's not the same Kromede you met in Kromede's Trial. She's...changed.</p>

          <p>What, it's too much trouble for a big tough Daeva like you? Or do you just like your shinies?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You won't find anything else in the world like the Jewel of the Judge. Especially not after I get my hands on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. And considering Daevas are immortal, that should tell you something!</p>

          <p>I hope you don't feel too bad. If what you told me is true, Kromede's been consumed by grief and hate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she was innocent before, she isn't anymore. She's a threat that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, it didn't get in the way of getting the Jewel of the Judge...?</p>

          <p>You deny it, but it seems pretty clear that it did.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, compassion is great and all, but we're at war here. Besides, Kromede's not worthy of it. Not anymore. She's too far gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So buck up, Daeva. You need to be ruthless. Kromede certainly will be. When she's done, put the weapon and her Tear in your Cube so I can get started.</p>

          <p>Phew, that was pretty intense. It's the most I've worked in such a short amount of time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But once you wield Kromede's Jewel in battle, I think you'll agree it was worth it!</p>
