          <p>[%username], this is a carefully-tended plant, ready to become a part of your home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's more, if you put this in your home, I'm certain that your butler will be very pleased.</p>

          <p>Take this Bloom to your home and put it wherever you want. Once you've placed it, perhaps you should ask your [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Housing_Butler] what he thinks about it.</p>

          <p>Ah, very nice. You got Bloom for free, did you? Very prudent. It is wise to save your Kinah when you can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You place a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Housing_Pot] the same way you arrange furniture, so I need not repeat myself.</p>

          <p>I would not presume to tell you that. I am a butler, not a personal decorator.</p>

          <p>Perhaps by the door? But that is just a suggestion.</p>
