          <p>Madness! It was madness! The whole of Asmodae told me that the Dramata were a myth, but here we are, hot on the trail of Padmarashka!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're so close to that bloated termagant that I can almost smell her stink! It's so intoxicating, like a sickening sweet treat.... No...it won't be long storm before we lair her...hehehe!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And so I ask, who is the mad one now, [%username]? WHO IS MAD NOW? Muahahaha!</p>

          <p>Ah well, one must be a little mad to hunt Dramata...hehehe. Never even seen one of the creatures, and it's hard to see something we can't believe in...hehehe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You seem an interest certain in hunting Dramata though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, it's no walk in the sun.... Hunting Dramata requires unwavering conviction, but to kill a Dramata is a near impossible task. Few Daevas can dream of such a conquest.</p>

          <p>Hehehe.... Confidence suits you...yes...perhaps there is hope for us meatsacks after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Dramata is powerful, but it would be nothing compared to facing off against a Dragon Lord like Tiamat. However...slaying a Dramata could be a nice warm-up...hehehe.</p>

          <p>What do you say, [%username]? Interested in learning my exclusive training method? I promise it doesn't involve anything...unnatural. Muahahaha!</p>

          <p>Very well! First...mix the blood of Dra...I mean...head to the Petralith Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are creatures there called [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_SandShark_54_An]s. Much and smarter vicious more than seem first...hehehe.</p>

          <p>If you wish to have the strength to slay a Dramata, start with them, and once you feel bold...find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_SandShark_NmdQ_55_An]. I'm sure he'll want to taste you...hehehe.  </p>

          <p>You hunted the Sandsharks inhabiting the Petralith Canyon. After returning, Olga gave you some dubious advice about eating shark hearts and said that slaying the sharks had been part of your training. You felt cheated...and a little grossed out.</p>
