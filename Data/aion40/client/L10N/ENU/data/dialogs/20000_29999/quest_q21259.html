          <p>You know, the Piece of Zikel isn't a magical tool that enhances a weapon all by itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can count on one hand the people I know of who have the skill and patience for the painstaking process. That's one reason why you rarely see the Piece.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I know one of those people who is available and almost certainly willing to help.</p>

          <p>Only in a sense. You see, the work involved is so specialized that she'll doubtlessly need a large amount of Kinah to do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener] will be completely transparent. She's a professional in that regard.</p>

          <p>I knew it. I knew you'd realize how important having extra strength is during a war like this one. Some Daevas never do, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It might end up being a sacrifice for you, but you'll get your money's worth, trust me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and let her know that I expect some gratitude--perhaps some supper--from her the next time I see her. A finder's fee, as it were.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But perhaps you should talk to her first? What can it hurt? The worst case scenario is that you have to put it off for a while.</p>

          <p>What? A Piece of Zikel? And Athana's Mace?! Of course I'd be willing to work with them! Are you a blasted fool?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Athana's Mace is one of the best-made weapons in Atreia, and Pieces of Zikel are the rarest of the rare. I can't pass up this opportunity.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But I won't charge you for labor; having this chance is payment enough for that. But can you afford the expenses?</p>
