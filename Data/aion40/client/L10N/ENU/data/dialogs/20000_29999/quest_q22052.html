          <p>While you were out, I learned that an Ellie named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_NPC_Q22052A] leads those vile Elyos Scouts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's knock his people off their clawless feet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without letting any Reians know, you must eliminate him.</p>

          <p>The Ellies are ready, too. The moment they're released from Kahrun's influence, they'll come after us with wings and weapons outstretched.</p>

          <p>Much as we have in common with our Reian allies, love of the Twiggies isn't on the list.</p>
