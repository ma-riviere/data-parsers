          <p>Did Belik tell you of the Dragonbound? Yes? Good, then I will not need to explain much further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As he told you, they are abducting and brainwashing Reians to add to their number. One of my brethren vanished just before your arrival, in fact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are not yet strong enough to storm their base at Udas Temple. We are waiting for more official support from Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>We need you to keep the Dragonbound from taking any more of us until that time arrives.</p>

          <p>They will divert manpower to replace those sentries, thus giving us breathing room. Can you do this for us?</p>

          <p>Belik's judgment proves sound once again. You have accomplished more than I could have hoped.</p>

          <p>I can tell that you are no ordinary Daeva. You may be the key to tipping the balance of this conflict in our favor.</p>
