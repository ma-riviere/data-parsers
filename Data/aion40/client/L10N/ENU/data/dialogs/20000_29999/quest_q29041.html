          <p>A Fine Drana Fragment. Was hoping I'd have it by now so I could run a few Stigma tests...but no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe the Shugo figured the fragment was worth something, and hightailed her way to the nearest vendor or broker.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_22] was her name. I don't suppose you fancy finding out what happened to my shipment? I'll pay you for your time.</p>
