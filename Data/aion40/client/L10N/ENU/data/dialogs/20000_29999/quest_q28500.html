          <p>Up to my neck in paperwork, [%username]. Got more paper cuts than an Ellie librarian, so I go and tell command, and you know what they do? Give me a special assignment. Typical.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to look at it for me. Sounds exciting, and you get to stretch out those legs of yours. Now, here's what's what. Odella and Odium have both been sprouting up all over the black market.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Streets of the stuff, enough to drive a Shugo tradeship into the ground. But the thing is...we heard that the Black Claw lot have actually been producing LESS Odella because their Skurvs have been getting abduc...</p>

          <p>When you stood there like a plum listening oh-so-intently to my little story, that's when. Now pay attention!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So...where was I? Oh yeah. Odella volumes up, Black Claw Odella production down. Something ain't right. Turns out the Black Claw Skurvs were being abducted and taken away to a hidden Odella plantation! Right under our bloody noses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We haven't found the place yet, but have narrowed down the entry point to just one location. All I need now...is someone to do the leg work. Someone like you, [%username].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You need to head over to Impetusium and speak to Gulkalla. He's been trying to coordinate the search for this new plantation, but you know...I hear the stress has made him...distracted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, that's between us. Go and see him, he'll be waiting on the upper levels of the reconstruction site. Unless he fell off, like that other one....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>First, Odium shell fragments. They're what you get after you extract Aether out of Odium crystals, and they've been spotted a couple of times around here. Find a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Mystery_OdStone_001_Da] and a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Mystery_OdStone_002_Da].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you've got them, hunt down a Shugo named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_IDNovice_1]. He's been seen sneaking around Impetusium for a while now, and we think he might have something to do with the plantation.</p>
