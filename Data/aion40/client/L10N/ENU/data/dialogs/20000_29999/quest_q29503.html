          <p>You're a sneaky one, [%username]. I've heard of your exploits across Atreia. I'd call your tactics dastardly, but to an Assassin, I imagine that would be a compliment!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To win a war like this, we can't just rely on honorable combat between two armies--our enemies surely do not, especially the arrogant Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need Assassins like you to carry out covert missions and take objectives that others can't. Stealth can be a most effective weapon, wouldn't you agree?</p>

          <p>Hahaha, I knew you would, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speaking of the need for stealth, the Temple of Death recently issued an official statement promoting the use of Greater Stigma. In addition, I received a shipment of Greater Stigma for Assassins!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Temple of Death must have recgonized the contributions of Assassins like you. Unfortunately, I can't just give these away without some kind of trial. Interested in proving yourself?</p>

          <p>Now then...I'm sure the Temple of Death would like to see the Assassins I reward at least proficient in using their own Greater Stigma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To prove yourself, use ***...hmmmm...about 10 times should be enough. Do that, and I'll reward you with one of these new Greater Stigma.</p>

          <p>Hmmmm...I'm dubious of taking the word of an Assassin, but I suppose you wouldn't lie to your own Preceptor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Very well, take this. A new Greater Stigma direct from the Temple of Death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not in a place to tell you what to do, but I'm sure the Temple of Death would appreciate if you took that Greater Stigma to Gelkmaros and used it to aid in the war effort.</p>
