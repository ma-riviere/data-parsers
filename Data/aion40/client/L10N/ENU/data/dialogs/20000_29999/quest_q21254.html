          <p>Welcome, [%username]. From Gelkmaros to Pandaemonium, the streets still buzz with talk of your part in our triumph over the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are grateful to you, and to all the other Daevas who played their role. Thanks to you, we continue to hold our own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mastarius asked me to convey his personal thanks, as has Lord Marchutan himself.</p>

          <p>Because of your valor, I ask you to take on another difficult task. We must keep the perilous situation you averted from returning to threaten us again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The time is ripe to turn the tables and attack Inggison. The Elyos will be frustrated, demoralized.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you agree to the mission, your ultimate reward will be an enhancement to your Bow. Will you accept this responsibility?</p>

          <p>My heart soars to see Asmodians like you fighting these battles.</p>

          <p>Your task is to kill the Guardian Generals of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A], opening the way for our conquest of all Inggison.</p>

          <p>There are many other Daevas, of course, but relatively few I'd entrust with a mission of this importance.</p>

          <p>Athana wishes to counter the recent Elyos assault by invading Inggison. Thus, she asked that you kill the Guardian Generals at the Temple of Scales and the Altar of Avarice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Bow.</p>
