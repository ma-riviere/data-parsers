          <p>Our success in Gelkmaros is dependent on expanding the terrain under our control. We must install Aetheric Field Generators as quickly as possible to press the attack.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of prime importance are the Nunglark Ruins and the Marayas Scrubland, but not much progress has been made as of yet. The Balaur have already installed Drana growing devices in those areas. They beat us to the punch.</p>

          <p>Indeed. The Drana growing devices represent the most advanced Balic technology. They not only activate Drana, but they keep our generators from producing artificial Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if we succeed in installing new Aetheric Field Generators, they will be useless unless we can destroy these Drana growing devices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are like living creatures, and they reproduce even if destroyed. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Martinez] is doing research into a way to permanently remove them, but he needs help. From you.</p>

          <p>Ah, it's good to see you, [%username]. Brigade General Valetta said she was sending someone to help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been studying the Drana growing devices as she asked, but I can't give it my full attention. I'm quite busy, you understand, but here's what I've worked out so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aether generators and the Drana growing devices are too close! Drana devices grow Drana, Aether generators restore Aether. Back and forth, back and forth, like a stone slab I once saw at the Temple of D...</p>

          <p>Oh. Right. Aether. Drana. As the two devices conflict, a special environment is being created. Anything that wanders nearby might be horribly mutated or killed. Or worse!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I'll need you to get some samples from the area. First some [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_OdPlants_Q20022], a very common plant in this area, though not so common as Duggan the Elder mentions in...what was that book?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be a moment finding this. You should also bring back some tissue samples from a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Hellhound_Wolf_53_An] and a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_OdAndDrana_Q20022]. That should do it.</p>

          <p>Exactly as I asked. If I'm right--and I'm right 81.7 percent of the time--I will now be able to chemically mutate the tissue of the Drana growing devices, rendering them useless.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm...perhaps you can help kill two qooqoos with one stone? There are some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanWi_Re_53_An]s near the Drana growing devices in the Marayas Wilderness. If you can dispatch them, it will make the upcoming process easier, and aid my research too.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Right, the solution. Applying this will stop the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF4_DranaSuctionDevice_B3_Q20022]s from absorbing Drana, and enable you to destroy them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should target the Nunglark Ruins first. The Marayas Wilderness can wait, since you eliminated the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_DrakanWi_Re_53_An]s there. Speaking of which, tell me--in detail--about your experiences with them. How did it make you feel?</p>
