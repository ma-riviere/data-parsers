          <p>Gah, those Strigik are a lot more trouble than we thought. They don't look strong, but they are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They don't even bother trying to communicate with us. They just attack, and keep on attacking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then, we are intruding on their territory. I guess we'd react the same way if we were them.</p>

          <p>It is. Feles is having a hard time getting research done, and we're usually overwhelmed and forced to fall back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ones that come right from the village are especially strong. But that's the one place we need to investigate most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could use some support here, [%username]. Cutting down their numbers in the Strigik Village would help us a lot.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and bring back 20 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21028a]s from them. Feles thinks she can figure out something about their diet or lifestyle with those.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>It's going to have to get done somehow, with or without you. I just think it'd go a lot easier if it were "with."</p>

          <p>Man, I'd rather be fighting the Elyos. At least they're Human...sort of. But they're still a little like us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Strigik, though.... They're even more vicious than the Mau. I could almost swear their eyes glow with hate....</p>

          <p>But that's just me. Feles is looking forward to studying those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21028a]s, you know.</p>

          <p>Sorry, that's not enough. Feles said she needs at least 20 to get anything useful out of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd pluck all the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_21028a]s out of one bird if I could, but she says she needs a wide range of samples to get accurate data.</p>

          <p>Don't worry, Varca and I can protect her until you get back.</p>

          <p>Those are Strigik Feathers, all right. They sure stink like them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With this many, I'm sure the Strigik Village is a lot quieter. Should be easier to infiltrate now.</p>

          <p>You've done a lot for all of us. Thanks a lot!</p>
