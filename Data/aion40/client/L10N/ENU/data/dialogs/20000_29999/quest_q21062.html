          <p>I suppose your deeds may impress minor Daevas like Kirhua, but it'll take more than that to wow Fundin the Fearless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you can go now. I've already taken care of every major threat here! Except the Elyos, of course, but their demise at my hands is inevitable!</p>

          <p>Well, if the beast [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dramata_57_Al] is still alive, then the Elyos will probably be after her. Looking for backbone or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no time to consider our options, kin. We'll hold off the cowards - you must kill the beast. Go!</p>

          <p>You disturbed Fundin the Fearless's beauty sleep! Er, I mean, recharging rest! To slay even more of Asmodae's enemies!</p>

          <p>Well, I can be magnanimous--I'll share with you this minor victory. But it would've gone even faster had I been part of your group!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now that the Elyos know an Asmodian defeated their Dramata, they will be even more susceptible to the crippling fear that comes with hearing the name Fundin the Fearless!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I give a slight nod of approval to you. And your scroll is glowing--perhaps Lord Marchutan also wishes to consult with the great Fundin?</p>
