          <p>I was wondering if I could ask you a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few days ago I had some of my bad luck and took a wrong turn. I ended up in the Sunken Canyon, where I met a Daeva of Minerals named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Carabel].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She said she's searching for ore containing Aether in the region, but I'm a little concerned about her well-being in such a place. And...</p>

          <p>Well...it just seems strange that she's out there all alone. She even refused an escort, very vehemently, I hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently she acts very furtive and secretive at the fortress too. Whenever someone approaches her, she gets tense and hostile.</p>

          <p>I know, I know. It's just that I've seen her at the fortress myself, and she always seems weighed down, as if she's carrying something heavy....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think she may be smuggling gems, but she'd be stupid to take such a big risk. She'd be punished severely for sure if she were caught.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Even if I'm wrong, she's still alone in that hostile place. Mind checking up on her?</p>
