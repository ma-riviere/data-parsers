          <p>Well, you have a couple of choices: you can buy a design for Agehia's Breastplate, or Agehia's Noble Breastplate. Unlike most designs, both are one-time use only, but the Noble version produces a Noble item with every crafting success.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>The Agehia's Breastplate design is pretty rough. There's a lot left up to the Armorsmith's skill and decision-making.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you might get Agehia's Noble Breastplate out of it...or you might not. It depends on how good you are.</p>

          <p>But it's cheaper--just 167,500 Kinah! If you're confident in your ability, it'll be fine! Do you want to buy it?</p>
