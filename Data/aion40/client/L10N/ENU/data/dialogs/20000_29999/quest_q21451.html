          <p>These are grim times, [%username]. Taloc is causing more problems than ever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An old friend of mine, Theilo, is suffering from severe fever and hallucinations. He's been that way ever since he returned from exploring Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's not the only one either. It seems many Daevas are suffering from a form of Aether addiction.</p>

          <p>Yes. Daevas are exposed to large amounts of Aether inside Taloc, so their bodies start demanding unreasonably high levels all the time. They go into withdrawal once they can't get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A scholar named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Schiemann] has been claiming to know of a cure. I haven't wanted to deal with him, but...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Frankly, I'm desperate now. Theilo has been there for me, so I must be there for him. Can you speak with Wistron for me?</p>

          <p>Good. Give him whatever help he requires.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have to warn you, though--the reason I didn't want to deal with him is that he's arrogant and insufferable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But for Theilo's sake, please suffer his attitude and bring back a cure.</p>

          <p>You may think that because Daevas are immortal, such illnesses are irrelevant. That can't be further from the truth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eternal life can also mean eternal suffering. Even if they die and return to an Obelisk, the Aether addiction will still hold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you can't understand, having been inside Taloc without falling ill. But I beg you to reconsider, for Theilo's sake.</p>

          <p>Bah, these Daevas have some nerve. They just go traipsing into Taloc, get themselves addicted to Aether, then don't even bother to mention this to Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I'd been brought in at the start of this, I could've saved them a lot of time and trouble, maybe saved a few Daevas from their agony.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But nooo! They dilly-dally, and now I have to start three steps behind. I tell you, if it weren't for my own curiosity, I'd tell them to...</p>

          <p>Oho, they're finally taking me seriously, are they? Better late than never, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they had one thing right: Taloc caused this malady, so Taloc very likely holds the key to curing it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since I certainly can't go in myself, I haven't made the cure yet, obviously. I need someone to go in for me....</p>
