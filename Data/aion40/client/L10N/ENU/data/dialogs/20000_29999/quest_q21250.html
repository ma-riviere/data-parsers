          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. You have come at a time of great rejoicing. Know that Mastarius has not forgotten about you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He knows that you contributed to his...our victory over the Elyos. He has made sure Lord Marchutan knows the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to your devotion, the sun-cursed have been driven back to Inggison.</p>

          <p>Exactly Lord Marchutan's words. He wishes to press our victory and turn the tables on the Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They will be demoralized, shaken. We will take advantage of this and invade Inggison, just as they invaded Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you help us, I will reward you by helping you to empower your greatsword on Lord Marchutan's behalf.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. You are a shining example for all of Asmodae. Your mission is to invade Inggison and defeat the Guardian Generals of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once we have both fortresses in our grasp, we can move on the Elyos. But we will succeed where they failed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Marchutan and the other Shedim Lords are watching over us. Victory will soon be ours. Blood for blood!</p>

          <p>But as much as Asmodae has already demanded of you, we cannot afford to let you rest too long. The Elyos won't.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Elyos territory and defeated the Guardian Generals. In gratitude, Athana promised you a Piece of Zikel, to unlock even greater power in Athana's Greatsword.</p>
