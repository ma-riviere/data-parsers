          <p>I see you still have the Piece of Zikel. I assume you've not found anything to do with it yet?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you: you can't just wave it over a weapon and expect it to become empowered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It actually takes great skill, patience, and discipline to actually fuse the two together.</p>

          <p>I said I was sorry! I have a lot on my mind, what with my duty to keep the Elyos and Balaur from demolishing us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, I don't think your smithing skills are up to the task. It requires the kind of skill one develops through a lifetime of training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, I know someone who fits the bill. I'm not sure if she's been training all her life, but her talents make it seem like she has.</p>

          <p>Her name is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Usener], and she lives in Pandaemonium. Perhaps the two of you have already met?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I anticipate this will cost you a good deal of Kinah, both for her time and materials. But it will be worth it, I assure you.</p>

          <p>Very wise. Even if it turns out you can't afford it, you should at least listen to what she has to say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I'm sure you've been able to tell, Balaurea is a dangerous land. Any advantage we hold over the Balaur or Elyos could be vital.</p>

          <p>Oh? Shame. The smallest increase in strength could be the difference between victory or defeat here.</p>

          <p>I don't know what expenses Usener will have, so wouldn't it be more prudent to ask her before giving up?</p>

          <p>All right, then.... You've come to the right person. I can certainly do what's required, but I'm afraid I'll need to use some rare materials of my own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those materials will cost 8,000,000 Kinah. Sorry, but that's non-negotiable. Still interested?</p>

          <p>Er, I'm afraid you're short on the components there. I won't be able to afford to take this job on without it. And frankly, that would be a tragedy for both of us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, you too. Partly because you'd not get your stronger Staff, of course. But also because I'd have to murder you for dangling hope of working on a Piece of Zikel in front of me, then cruelly taking it away.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>By Azphel.... The Piece of Zikel is everything I'd ever heard. It's like it just melted into the Staff like butter over a hot plate of Granker Pasta....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That was well worth it for me. I think that once you wield the Staff in battle, you'll find it worth your while too.</p>
