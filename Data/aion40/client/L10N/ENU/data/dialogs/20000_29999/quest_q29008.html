          <p>But this is a great test. You must impress the Convent of Marchutan with a weapon worthy of High Priest Agehia herself.</p>

          <p>Agehia's Noble Greatsword is the key to great things. Will you take up the challenge?</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mime] has the design you need. You'll have to buy it yourself, but it's worth the Kinah.</p>

          <p>Yes, I do have the design you need...in a sense. I actually sell two: one for Agehia's Greatsword, and one for Agehia's Noble Greatsword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both are one-time use only, so be careful. The first costs 251,000 Kinah, and the second 334,500 Kinah. The good part is, if you buy the better version, you'll get a Noble item every time, as long as your crafting is successful. Any questions?</p>

          <p>The design for Agehia's Greatsword is very basic--there are many factors left up to the smith, like Aether balance and metallic reactions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Making Agehia's Noble Greatsword from this design takes great skill, patience, and a little luck. As such, the chances are against the average weaponsmith succeeding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the price is lower--only 251,000 Kinah, and that includes a prototype.</p>
