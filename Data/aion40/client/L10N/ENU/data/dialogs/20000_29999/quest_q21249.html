          <p>There! Ha, I love it! Sometimes I think maybe I really am the genius everyone says I am!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sorry, I'm a little excited. I've never worked under these conditions, yet I still managed to make something so beautiful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will it work? Well, it should. Theoretically, it's perfect. Of course, that says nothing about practice....</p>

          <p>Yeah, you're right. Nothing to do but trust in fate and give this a shot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hey, if I could ask you for one more favor.... If I don't make it, I want you to take a message to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Javis].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's a family servant, practically raised me. Tell him...to look under my bed. There's a letter there I want him to read.</p>

          <p>Thanks. That's a load off my mind. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Javis] should still be in Gelkmaros Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, nothing left to do but to give this armor a try.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While I'm getting it on, could you make sure there are no Balaur left in the area? No sense getting attacked just as I get out.</p>

          <p>So...you'll mow down a bunch of Balaur and search a dangerous facility, but won't deliver a simple message?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you afraid of servants? Or maybe Gelkmaros Fortress? That's where he probably is, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're going to be that way, I'd like you to leave now. Your very presence just annoys me.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Such a handful, the young master. A brilliant armorsmith, but so irresponsible, drunk half the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I try my best to keep him out of trouble, but I'm a man, not a machine. So...where is he? In some tavern, perhaps?</p>

          <p>Really! The Naduka Biolab! He really was in trouble this time! He was lucky you were there to help pull him out of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now he has an exciting new toy to play with, so he probably won't be home anytime soon. At least it'll help keep him alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for helping the young master and reassuring his overworked, underpaid guardian. I'm sure he'd want me to give you this.</p>

          <p>Starket has completed the Drakan armor, but wasn't sure it'd work. He asked you to contact his guardian and family servant, Javis, should something go wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, the armor worked. Giddy with success, he changed his message to Javis: he would now be trying out his new armor across Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went to Gelkmaros Fortress and met with Javis. He was amazed at what his master had gone through, and repaid you for your time.</p>
