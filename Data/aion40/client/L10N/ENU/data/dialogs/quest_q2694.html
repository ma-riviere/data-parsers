          <p>The Aether that's driving the Krall mad is strange, and it's affecting the Krall physically. Krall who've gone mad are reported to be...well, green, if the report's correct. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're abnormally strong and completely insane. You should be able to handle them, though. </p>

          <p>If you hunt Insane Dark Shamans or Insane Cursers in the Contested Expanse or the Kunpapa Outpost, you'll be able to get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2694a]. Of course, I'm not certain it's green--I haven't seen it. It's definitely dangerous, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to Heiron through the rift, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallWizardMad_40_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallWizardMad_42_Ae]s and bring that strange Aether back here. Any questions?</p>

          <p>Remember, the rift appears in Mahisha's Nest, southwest of Kidorun's Campsite. When you get to Heiron, take the road south from the Decayed Grove past the Black Tears Swamp, and that will take you to Kishar Village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to go past the village and up the hill to the east. That's where you'll find the Krall who've gone mad. Keep in mind, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallWizardMad_40_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KrallWizardMad_42_Ae]s are known to be extremely violent, so please be careful. </p>
