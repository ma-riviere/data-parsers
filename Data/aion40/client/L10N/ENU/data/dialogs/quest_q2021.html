          <p>The Mau are up to something...and I think I know what it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deep within the earth under [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_15], I can feel pulses of energy. Mystical energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've studied this sort of thing before. That's why Brigade General Suthran assigned me to this forward post.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if I'm going to learn more, [%username], I'm going to need your help.</p>

          <p>I'm not going to lie. This is a really dangerous task--too dangerous for me.</p> 
          <p> </p>	
          <p>Go to the entrance of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_20] and examine the large totem. I need to know what the Mau are placing there as offerings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mau will tear apart any intruders, but I can give you a magical disguise that will make you look like a Mau. Don't talk or fight, and it should hold up...for a little while.</p>

          <p>Taora sensed pulses of mystic energy coming from the Black Claw Tribe. She transformed you into a Mau to get close and see what offerings they were placing under their great totem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found no offerings when you scouted the totem but did see three smaller totems marked with the name Zemurru.
