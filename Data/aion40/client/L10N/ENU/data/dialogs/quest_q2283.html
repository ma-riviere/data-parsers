          <p>The defeat of the Black Claw Tribe has been my biggest achievement since I came to Altgard, and I owe it all to you, Daeva. I wish I had a dozen like you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must report the good news to Pandaemonium, or rather you must! They must know of your achievements here.</p>

           <p>It says here you weakened the power of the Black Claw Tribe in Altgard. Suthran had driven them back, but you finished the job. And I'm extremely happy to read that some Mau want to ally with us.</p>
