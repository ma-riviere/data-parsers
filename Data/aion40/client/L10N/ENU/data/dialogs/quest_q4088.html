          <p>Sniff...sniff...you have recently been to Brusthonin, right?</p>

          <p>Most Shugos say they have nose for business, or nose for Kinah, akakak. But Micorunerk has best nose of all. Micorunerk's nose knows all! You come from Brusthonin because it is the only place with both a stuffy smell and a salty sea smell, nyerk. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you happen to meet a pirate there? Funny hat? Keeps talking about a compass?</p>

          <p>But no one gives a Shugo delivery location information. If it weren't for Micorunerk's nose, this Shugo wouldn't even know it goes to Brusthonin! You know where he is, Daeva. Would you take this small package to him?</p>
