          <p>Your name is prominent in those stories, and I wondered what kind of person you were. Meeting you now, you're quite different than I expected.</p>

          <p>In Theobomos, there's a story of an Elim--Koreumtor, the Elder of Wisdom--who probably could have helped you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hasn't been seen for a while, but I do know an Elim who might know his whereabouts. Would you like an introduction?</p>
