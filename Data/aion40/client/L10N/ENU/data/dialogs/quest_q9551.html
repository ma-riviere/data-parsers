          <p>I had a contract with the Shugos to make deliveries for me all over Atreia! Apparently they didn't feel like making the deliveries, so they ran off!</p>

          <p>Now they're denying any of it happened! They say no Shugos ran away, and the deliveries are delayed because they're overloaded with work.</p>
