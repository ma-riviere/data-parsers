          <p>There is a Shugo cube craftsman. Legend crafter he is, yes! Great Shugo's name is Vindachinerk! Vindachinerk made 100-slot cube. Beautiful, delicate, a wonder. Very very nice cube, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he went to the Abyss, then disappeared after being harassed by jealous Shugos. Now only two disciples know where he is, nyerk.</p>
