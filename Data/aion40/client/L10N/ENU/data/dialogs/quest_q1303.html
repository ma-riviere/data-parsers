          <p>Strange incidents have occurred across Atreia ever since the Cataclysm. They were hardly noticeable at first, but are becoming more serious as time goes by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you noticed the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_lupyllini_19_n]s around the fortress have started to attack people?</p>

          <p>Yes, they're the ones. It could be something in their food or water making them violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only the Plumas know for certain. Maybe I can coax some answers out of their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1303a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hollow core is prone to capturing toxins in their bodies. Would you help me out?</p>
