	<p>I wish I could see the Balaur Treasury for myself. Seeing that mountainous hoard of ancient relics would warm my scholar's heart.</p>

	<p>I suppose I'll just have to be satisfied with the treasures others bring me. Do you have any Ancient Icons I might examine?</p>

	<p>It's not that old, but it's in good condition.</p>

  <p>We have to preserve our cultural heritage. We can't let artifacts like these stay in the hands of the Balaur.</p>

	<p>I'm not saying I can't exchange any more relics for you, ever, just not right now. You wouldn't want to waste those Abyss Points, would you? And you see, you're all full up for now. Just check with me when you're stronger and have room for more points.</p>
