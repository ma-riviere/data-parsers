          <p>I know supplies are short right now, but I hadn't imagined how many people would be lining up to come help. It's really keeping me busy, organizing all this. </p>

          <p>The armor from Kurngalfberg must really be great. Have you come to earn some, too? </p>

          <p>All right then. You've heard the latest, yes? The Daevas of Flame are melting the ice in Kurngalfberg with Magic Flame Wards as fast as they can, but it's still very slow going. They're running out of materials to create the flames faster than they're making progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They've requested support from the Beluslan Fortress--Magic Wards material in exchange for armor found in Kurngalfberg. Since that means Balaur armor, it's worth a pretty penny--assuming you'll let someone pry it from your cold, cold hands.</p>

          <p>Let me check...they sent a list, you see. Blessed Huge Magic Flame Ward Components are [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring those, you get a pair of Kurngalfberg pants as a reward.</p>

          <p>Glad to hear it. You can get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03] from the Balaur in Draupnir Cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful, though--you can only get Balaur Black Magic Crystals and Blue Balaur Blood from special Balaur such as Lazy Dragashum, Instructor Afrane, and Greatscholar Jaadis. I wouldn't go alone if I were you, but you'll know best, I'm sure. Blood for blood!</p>

          <p>Busy? I know, it seems like a small task. It's really important, though. If those rewards don't appeal to you, you might consider getting the materials for other wards. Small Magic Flame Wards get you Kurngalfberg Gloves, Pauldrons, or Shoes, while Blue Magic Flame Wards get you a Kurngalfberg jacket. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it and let me know what you'd like to do. All hands are welcome in this task. </p>

          <p>Hmm. This was good work, but it seems we've had a misunderstanding. I need 3 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01]s, 3 bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and 30 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s. That's not what this is.

          <p>You brought all of them! That's wonderful. You wouldn't believe how many people sign up to bring in materials but never follow through. As it is, we've had far more people bring in the materials for Small Magic Flame Wards than anything else.</p>
