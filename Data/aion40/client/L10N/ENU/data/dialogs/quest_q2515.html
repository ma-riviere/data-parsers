          <p>Feign ignorance then. It doesn't matter. I have several very important jobs for someone. Perhaps you'd be interested. There's quite a large reward involved. </p>

          <p>I need someone to go to Pandaemonium and deliver this letter to Araison. He's been writing love songs to me, and I'd like him to stop.</p>

          <p>In Market Street there's a merchant--[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mareke]--who has a necklace for me. Ordinarily I only shop in Prosperity Road, of course, but this item seemed to be of high enough quality for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And on the way back, stop into Morheim and find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_5], who's ordered me some fabulous face cream--all the ladies in Vanahal use it, he says. </p>
