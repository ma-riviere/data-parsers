          <p>Bah! This letter isn't what I expected at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, this? It's a letter from Judge Anund. I'd expected it to be about my impending transfer to Pandaemonium, but it contains new mission orders. I'm to get rid of the protectors in the Sky Temple of Arkanis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It makes no sense. I'm collecting information about missing Daevas. Why are my superiors distracting me?</p>

          <p>The Sky Temple of Arkanis is inhabited by many brutal creatures--protectors created to guard it. They attack everyone who approaches the temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My gut is telling me something's wrong, though. The Shadow Court never cares about things like...well, anyway. I'd like to continue to concentrate on my original task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you go to the Sky Temple of Arkanis and get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SAMD_30_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MaidengolemD_30_Ae]s in my place?</p>

          <p>Good, good. That's one less concern. If you're taking care of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SAMD_30_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MaidengolemD_30_Ae]s, I can keep trying to figure out why these Daevas are missing.</p>
