          <p>I've got to go see Moreinen. I just wish I didn't have to go to the Temple of Knowledge to do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did I mention how much I hate that place? She loves it--she's my darling historian, after all. But she has to know how uncomfortable other people feel in there--like we're being pressured to study or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No point in talking to her now--she's too angry. Ol' Eramir really screwed up this time. I should have visited sooner, huh? I ought to get her a present or something...just to show her I really do care....</p>

          <p>Right! Everyone loves presents, don't they? She can't stay angry with a guy who's given her something nice, can she? Especially...when the guy's made the present himself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's what I'll do, [%username]! What should I make, though?</p>

          <p>I know! A good Aether Crystal's as beautiful as a jewel, and you can scent it with fragrance, too. She'll love it!</p>

          <p>I can make one if I have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shopmaterial_co_12a], [%dic:STR_DIC_I_first_aid_30a], and an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_od_d_n_c_20a]. Those aren't easy to get...but I guess if these things weren't rare, they wouldn't be so special.</p>

          <p>Seriously, I owe you one. Thanks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_od_d_n_c_20a] itself will be the most difficult to get. You have to extract it from above the Morheim Ice Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should be able to get hold of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shopmaterial_co_12a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_first_aid_30a] right here in Pandaemonium. There's a cooking merchant called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Daraia] and a general goods merchant called [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nekai]. Either of them should be able to help us out.</p>

          <p>That's not just what I do for fun. It's...kind of what I'm for. It's a duty, you know? I had to study it, work at it, like any other role around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That means I'm way behind on my basic skills, though. I haven't practiced Aethertapping for ages. Please help me.</p>
