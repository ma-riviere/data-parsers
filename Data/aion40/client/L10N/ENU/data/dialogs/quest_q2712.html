		<p>Gladiators, Templars, Rangers and Assassins should talk to the combat administration officers.</p>

		<p>Impressive, [%username]. I haven't seen gold coins for a long time. Such a pretty color...</p>

		<p>You've done well. Sadly, not everyone does. Like Qooqoos, some stubbornly refuse to spread their wings. </p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Many young Daevas may never discover what you've learned today--there are great rewards for those who find strength in the darkness.</p>

		<p>Twenty gold coins? [%username], you are the best of the best, and deserve the best of the best.</p>

		<p>You know, when Pandaemonium first issued these coins, I expected minimum efforts from young Daevas.</p>

		<p>But you...I'm proud to meet someone we can count on to fight for the victory of Asmodae.</p>

		<p>1, 2, 3... Yes, you have exactly 8 silver coins, and for that, I'll give one of these rewards.</p>

		<p>Not everyone is as accurate with numbers as I am, but you should know you don't have the correct number of coins to collect a reward.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>So, check back with me after you carry out enough missions to earn 10 or more gold coins, or 8 or more silver coins.</p>
