	<p>Twenty gold coins. I can appreciate how much you must have gone through to collect that many.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>A high priest of Pandaemonium once told me this half in jest--"The one who becomes rich by collecting coins is the one Asmodae really needs." You understand, do you not?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I think this may be useful to you, [%username].</p>

	<p>Your reputation seems to have been earned. It's hard enough to get one gold coin, but you've collected forty!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I'd like to give you something special, [%username].... Oh, yes. This is just the thing.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Consider it a just reward for a brave [%userclass].</p>
