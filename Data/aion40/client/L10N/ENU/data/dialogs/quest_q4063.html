          <p>I really do admire those Brohums. They survived when Humans didn't.</p>

          <p>They were the stronger race then, but we're the stronger race now.</p>

          <p>The Brohums have some method that kept their lands clear of contamination. Since they won't share the secret with us, we'll just have to take those lands from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they can't defend it against us, they don't deserve to live there.</p>

          <p>You'll find them all over Brohunir and the Iollu Forest. If you're as strong as I've heard, they shouldn't be a problem.</p>
