          <p>I've got a big, big order to fill, Daeva. Perhaps you can help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We only sell manastones outside the city limits in bulk orders now. Our deal is dimes, Daeva. We deal in bundles of 10, no less, to the outsiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I've got a gang of soldiers-for-hire looking for MP +60, Evasion +12, and Parry +20 manastones...and they'll pay nicely for 10 of each, so that's what I need. Can you help me out?</p>

          <p>Let me just make this very, very clear to you: 10 apiece, MP +60, Evasion +12, and Parry +20 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The union's new rules, not mine. But I'll reward you well if you can get them for me. Check your cube and warehouse for them...odds are good you have them on you.</p>

          <p>Well, it's your loss, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd rather have one big bundle of mysterious manastones than 30 old and dying manastones that you know aren't worth their weight in Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> But that's just me. And you, apparently, are not like me.</p>
