          <p>Faith and arms, [%username]. Well, my initial crystal estimates were incorrect. I assumed five crystals would be enough for my experiments. I was way off guild with that figure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only thing constant about science is its watery flux, am I right? Ha ha ha. Ahh, I could go on and on.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I'm getting at is, I'll need a few more [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1610a]s. Two crystals to study their influence on Aether, one to balance the metasis phase, another one to...</p>

          <p>Five. Five Earth Crystals are what I'll need.</p>

          <p>Oh, you are an exceptional friend to the sciences!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should be able to locate a good batch of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3_40_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth4_40_An]s near the Lepharist Research Center. You'll know what to do from there, I assume.</p>

          <p>I believe I made it very clear that you'd encounter [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3_40_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth4_40_An]s when procuring Earth Crystals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, this is more frightening for you than I'd thought...and having already used every sample I had! Now I have nothing left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the name of science, please keep your word! You don't realize how valuable those five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1610a]s are to me...to all of Elysea!</p>

          <p>Yeah, I didn't think so either. You'd rather break bones than study them. Here, this is the reward I promised you for your help.</p>
