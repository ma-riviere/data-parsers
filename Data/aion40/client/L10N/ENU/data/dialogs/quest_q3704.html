          <p>You're the one Nereus wanted, aren't you? [%username]? I don't mean to trouble you, but if you're heading to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_All], then I'm in need of your services too.</p>

          <p>The researchers have contacted me, and want me to recover some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3704a]s for their studies. We're in an arms race, they said, and if we're going to keep our noses in front, we need to know exactly what they're field testing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As luck would have it, or Kaisinel would choose it, the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_All] is the site where the Balaur test their prototype weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I need now is for someone...someone like you mayhap, to go to their training grounds, and take those weapons from them. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Very good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I understand the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3704a]s are all kept inside a big [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDAB1_MiniCastle_DragonArms_Q3704]. Find that, and you're halfway there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the Balaur won't be thrilled with you plundering their supplies, but Nezekan watches, and waits for the scales of justice to start leaning towards the light. Do not disappoint him, [%username].</p>

          <p>Hmm, the balance isn't quite right, but that's quite typical of prototype weapons. This edge though...I've never seen anything like it.</p>
