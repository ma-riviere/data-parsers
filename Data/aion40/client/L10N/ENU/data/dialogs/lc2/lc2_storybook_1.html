          <p>Who's Who: Benes</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva of Divine Clothing who operates a Fine Boutique on Divine Road in Sanctum. Benes began studying needlework as Andu's apprentice at the age of seven. Naturally gifted, she rose quickly through the Handicrafting ranks and opened her own shop just a short 15 years later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With her unrivaled color-coordination abilities, it's no wonder that Bennes is called "the magician of colors." Her brilliantly colored Stenon dress remains a top seller to this day, despite the twenty-year-old design. A true classic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Benes is the author of the bestsellers "Now This is Needlework", "Living as a Single Woman", and "A Fashion for Any Occasion".</p>

          <p>Do you have your eye on someone special? Someone who makes your blood run fast? If he hasn't made the first move, it's up to you. Invite him on a picnic date. Now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Show up ten minutes late to your date, but arrive wearing a Stenon dress in all its vivid glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From the very first glimpse of you in that dress, he'll be yours.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>To be the center of any gathering, try the Chipao line from Benes. Wearing Chipao, from the moment you step into the room till the moment you leave, all eyes will be on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Chipao creation in red will really make a statement, but the current rage in Sanctum is black and white stripes.</p>

          <p>It's so hard to look your best while carrying off that casual, simple style.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To liven up your everyday attire, try adding accessories from Benes. May we recommend a cowboy hat or a pair of red-framed glasses. Perhaps a pair of quilted sox suspenders? Come see us to view our entire line. We're sure you'll find something just right to liven up that old pair of leather leggings.</p>
