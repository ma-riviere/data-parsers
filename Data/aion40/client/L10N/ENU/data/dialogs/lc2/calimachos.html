          <p>The roads of scholarship are long and harsh. For knowledge gained without wisdom is useless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And there is no compass to guide you to wisdom. Only an open mind and a passion for knowledge can help you on your way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Using your skills, [%username], to protect and benefit those seeking knowledge of Atreia's past and future is indeed a great pursuit. I encourage you to continue down that noble path.</p>
