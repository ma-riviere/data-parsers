        <p>Have you ever noticed how some Daevas can figure stuff out from just reading a book? And others, yeah...like trying to teach a Sprigg. Why I had this one student, Jiradia, do you know her? You do...oh, never mind.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>My advice? Don't try to learn everything at once. Learn and master one skill at a time. Methodical. That's the trick.</p>
