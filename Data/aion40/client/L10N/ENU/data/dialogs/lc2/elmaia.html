          <p>Arieluma, Geradina...or is it Rollan? What? It's [%username]? Are you sure?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course you're sure! Where is my memory today. I swear, I may still look young, but I ascended more than 200 years ago...or was it 300? Some days I think my body ascended but my brain stayed behind!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes. If you get any accessories from me today, I suggest you double-check your packages to make sure I don't give you the wrong thing. Sorry, but some days....</p>
