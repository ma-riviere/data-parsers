          <p>Sanctum Daevas may appear civilized, but deep inside they are all gossiping busybodies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was at Protectors Hall before being assigned here, and the Holy Templars there hang out at the Dionysia each evening to gossip. Hmph!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've enjoyed a drink with them on occasion, but talking about someone who's not there makes me uncomfortable. [%username], if you plan on staying in Sanctum long, take care not to become the subject of such conversations.</p>
