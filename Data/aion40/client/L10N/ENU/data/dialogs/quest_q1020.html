          <p>We know that the Abyss is connected to Elysea and Asmodae, but it seems the Balaur also have access to it from their dimension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It doesn't take a military genius to work out that they'll try to get to Elysea through the Abyss. Of course, they wouldn't dare approach our Abyss Gate with our Guardians protecting it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Krall are constructing their own Abyss Gate using the Odium they've refined. If they succeed, the Balaur will be able to enter Elysea.</p>

          <p>And we will. Or you will. The Abyss Gate is deep within [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA23_1]. When you reach it, touch the guardian stone to summon [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterSQ_20_An], who guards the gate. Kill him and take his Seal. It's the only way to block the gate.</p>

          <p>Failure is not an option, [%username]. The weight of Elysea is on your shoulders. Carry it well, and report back to me once you've sealed the gate.</p>
