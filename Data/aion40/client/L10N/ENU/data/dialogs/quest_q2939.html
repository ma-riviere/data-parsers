          <p>I'm afraid it's sizable. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fraiban] needs this titanium Greatsword in the Abyss. I sent him a crate of weapons four days ago, and he's already ordered more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, it's worrisome. Every other day more orders arrive. Strife in the Abyss is rising. I'd like to look in myself, but I might as well be welded right here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you would go in my stead, I'd owe you a debt.</p>

          <p>Thank you. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fraiban] will appreciate a smith bringing them personally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He works out of Primum Landing. It's a lot safer than other places in the Abyss, but I'd keep your guard up.</p>

          <p>Back to the forges, young'un. Someone else can go.</p>

          <p>Maybe Elgar could look after the forge, and...no, better not, or I'd come back to a burned-out shell.</p>
