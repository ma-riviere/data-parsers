          <p>Are you ready for the big time? We really need someone to retrieve raw materials for Blue Magic Flame Wards. Think you could do it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't mean to imply you couldn't, but acquiring them will be...a challenge. Hardly anyone is attempting it and we need them really badly. I'm sure you know the tale by now, but I'll go through it again, just in case. </p>

				<p>You've heard the latest, yes? The Daevas of Flame are melting the ice in Kurngalfberg with Magic Flame Wards as fast as they can, but it's still very slow going.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>They're running out of materials to create the flames faster than they're making progress.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>They've requested support from Beluslan Fortress--Magic Ward material in exchange for armor found in Kurngalfberg. Since that means Balaur armor, it's worth a pretty penny--assuming you'll let someone pry it from your cold, cold hands.</p>

          <p>Creating Blue Magic Flame Wards requires [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s. You'll get a Kurngalfberg Jacket as a reward.</p>

          <p>Glad to hear it. You can get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s from the Balaur in Draupnir Cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be careful, though--you can only get Balaur Black Magic Crystals and Blue Balaur Blood from particular Balaur--Kind Saraswati, Instructor Afrane, and Greatscholar Jaadis. I wouldn't go alone if I were you.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>If the jacket doesn't appeal to you, you might consider getting the materials for other wards.</p>

          <p>Hmm. This was good work, but it seems we've had a misunderstanding. I need 4 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_01]s, 4 bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_02], and 40 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_DRAUPNIR_QUEST_03]s. You know what I'm saying, right? Go get the right materials and I'll give you your reward. </p>
