          <p>Did you talk to Benyar? I hope you weren't offended by his unfriendly attitude. He doesn't trust Daevas. He insists that we Humans must do everything for ourselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand what he means. We don't want to become too dependent on help that could vanish at any time. It's a hard thing to swallow, this feeling of helplessness....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there are things that require assistance. If we let our pride rule us, all could be lost.</p>

          <p>Exactly. I'm telling you this because I need to ask your help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went to The Whispering Forest to collect firewood the other day and I saw Liches, Unfests, and Lament Obscuras, all closer than ever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're getting closer to this Refugee Village every day. If we don't do anything, they'll overrun the refugees and all our efforts will be for nothing.</p>

          <p>We Humans aren't capable of dealing with them. We can avoid them well enough most of the time to collect food or firewood, but if they attack, we haven't a chance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Benyar might not admit it, but it's beyond our abilities.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Aion created Daevas to protect Humans in situations like this, so I'm asking that you use your power to destroy the undead in The Whispering Forest.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Look for [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LichD_39_An]es, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GraveknightD_40_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShadowStalkerD_40_An]s in the Whispering Forest.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>At her request, you went to The Whispering Forest and destroyed Friar Liches, Graveknight Guards, and Lament Obscuras.</p>

          <p>When you reported back, Vonduca was relieved and expressed her gratitude.</p>
