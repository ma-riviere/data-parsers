          <p> </p>
          <p>The first day I saw him I knew he had to wear something I'd created someday. If only he were a model, I could dress him up all the time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this outfit! It's my heart and soul, my elegant glory. I hope to see him in it!</p>

          <p>Oh. My. How generous she is. Observe this dizzying array of colors, this novel mix of fabric and leather. And, lo, we'll be able to see more of my skin than ever before! Is it supposed to be an undergarment? Or perhaps a rain coat?</p>
