          <p>Azphelumbra, [%username]. Oh dear! We simply must get you out of those dreadful clothes! I'd just love to take some measurements and use you as a model for my next masterpiece...but unfortunately I have a more pressing matter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that you're a Daeva of distinguished tastes, and I'm hoping you will understand the importance of this little situation. My very reputation hangs in the balance!</p>

          <p>Well, I'm holding this fabulous fashion contest--the inaugural Daskin Fashion Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You haven't heard of it? This is most embarrassing...it seems word of the contest hasn't spread as far as I had hoped. But regardless, I need three talented judges. I've sent out letters, but haven't received any responses!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just can't imagine why! I need you to seek out my judges and get their answers, [%username].</p>

          <p>Wonderful! I've invited [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eiren], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kari], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phyper] to judge the contest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eiren deals in divine clothing, and his instincts are second to none. Kari crafts and sells armor in Beluslan, and comes from a long line of master tailors. Phyper...he might seem the odd duck of the group, but his aesthetic sense is top notch. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I implore you, [%username], please get their responses. The success of the contest depends on it! </p>

          <p>Beauty is a fickle and subjective master. I'm enamored with my wife, but is she the most beautiful woman in all of Asmodae? For me, yes, but for others, I'd imagine not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The truth is, we're all beautiful in someone's eyes, but well designed clothing enhances our natural beauty. Know what I mean, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You're in luck, I've just completed some new designs. Please talk to Lark.</p>

          <p>Daskin.... Right. I got his letter inviting me to judge some...contest of his. I haven't given him an answer, and I was kind of hoping he would just stop pestering me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm familiar with Daskin's talents, but we're two different artisans. There's a clear difference between tailoring divine attire and frivolous costumes. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judging in the contest wouldn't be all that difficult, but it wouldn't be beneficial for either of us. I've got strong opinions about clothing, and I wouldn't want to ruin Daskin's reputation by being too critical. Please tell him that I decline.</p>

          <p>Ah yes, Daskin! I'm flattered that he holds me in such high esteem. Don't get me wrong, I'm a first rate armor fabricator. But as for judging costumes...I'm not so sure that I'm qualified.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a little worried, but this is a great chance to meet others involved in our trade. Besides, Daskin told me that I'd be well compensated--more than enough to cover the business I'll be missing out on!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please tell Daskin that I will make preparations at the shop, and see him in Pandaemonium in time for the contest.</p>

          <p>A letter? I never got a letter. Either it was lost or Daskin made a mistake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judging a fashion contest? I've asked Daskin about it before, so it seems he's come around to the idea. I might not look it, but I have an excellent fashion palate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm afraid the timing is all wrong. I'm in the middle of an important mission, and I don't have the time to travel to Pandaemonium to attend a contest.
