          <p>Ah, [%username], I'm so glad to see you again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I made a mistake when I sent you out to hunt those angry spirits before. Yes, they were troublesome, and I'm glad they're gone, but I failed to notice they weren't the only ones causing issues.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have another problem on the ground.</p>

          <p>Wild Sandstorm Spirits are creating whirlwinds down there. They're throwing the students off the flight course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm supposed to evaluate everyone fairly, but when external factors interfere in the test, that's impossible.</p>

          <p>Now whenever anyone fails, they just say "Oh, it was a gust from below." There's no way for me to know if that's true or not, so I have to let them retake the test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So please, go to the ground and get rid of ten of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_7C_elementalair3_32_Ae]s for me. It'll make the test more fair.</p>
