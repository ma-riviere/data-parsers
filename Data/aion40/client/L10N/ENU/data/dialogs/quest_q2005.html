          <p>A few of our number seem determined on making our whole gang look like incompetent fools. I've never seen anything like it.</p>

          <p>You think I'm talking about Derot and his crazy moneymaking schemes, right? Wrong. Derot may be greedy, but he's not foolish. I'm talking about a few of the others who'll stay nameless...for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those idiots thought it'd be a good idea to head out to the Odella Plantation and get their greedy hands on the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2005A] there....</p>

        <p>Had they bumped into a Mau war party, I'd understand! But it was nothing worse than the Dundun sentries that are always there. And to our shame, these fools still had their skulls cracked!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It gets worse. They fled in...I can hardly say it...disarray.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I need to assemble some real raiders to head back to the Plantation and show the Mau we're not all so cowardly.</p>

          <p>Head back out to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA192] and rough up enough [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_8_An]s so that they know not to mess with the Ulgorn Raiders. While you're there, gather up some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2005A], just to help us meet the quota for the next caravan.</p>

          <p>Good work. Excellent work, in fact.</p>

          <p>The growing number of Mau worries Ulgorn. He's concerned that they'll outgrow their land, and then they'll try to expand to Anturoon Crossing...and eventually Aldelle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a good thrashing from you, I'm sure they'll think twice about coming here. Here's your pay. You've earned it.</p>
