          <p>The local Krall sure have been acting strangely!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When they first invaded, they were typical Krall, mounting raids and causing trouble wherever they went.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, though, they're burrowing deep into the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA08], and when our scouts get close they just go berserk! And I mean more berserk than usual.</p>

          <p>Sure, if you think you can take on the Krall. I should warn you though, [%username], these Tursin tribesmen are wily as well as strong, and there are many of them in that cave. You'll need your wits to get into the mines, never mind back out from them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dukaki have been mining ore in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07] and taking wagonloads of it into the caves. This ore must be something special: eight Krall watch each wagon--far more than for regular ore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need samples of whatever it is they're mining. Think you can get me some?</p>

          <p>Great. One of our scouts slipped into the caves the day before yesterday, and said she saw rows of bins along the walls. She opened one and found ore inside, but a Krall patrol chased her off before she could take any.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need you to head into the mines and fetch three samples of the ore. Once you have them, take them straight to Captain [%dic:STR_DIC_LA139].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully he can work out just what those Krall are up to.</p>

          <p>You know, you're getting quite a name for yourself. I've had villagers asking for you by name, and even traders traveling from Verteron have heard of your exploits. Keep this up and I'll have to start paying you more!</p>

          <p>Hmm. I'm afraid I can't work on such a limited sample, mercenary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need at least three chunks of ore to study if I'm to ascertain any sense of consistency in them. I cannot make solid observations on such a small sample.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Looks like Odium, but it's not normally this translucent. The Krall must have processed it, but why? What would processed ore do that Odium normally cannot? I must think on this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As for you, my friend, I'll see to it that your services are recognized. Take this bonus, and keep up the good work.</p>
