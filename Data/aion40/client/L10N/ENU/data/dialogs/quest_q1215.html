          <p>You've come to the wrong place if you're after information. I only arrived here recently. You've probably heard more than I have, stranded out here on the coast. Not that I'm complaining.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it would be nice to get my hands on something a little more substantial than the odd jobs.</p>

          <p>Yes! And there are so many mouths to feed. You'd think at least one of them would ask if I needed help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And they're always whining--nothing can please them! Something's always wrong, no matter what I do.</p>

          <p>Frustrating. That's putting it delicately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least they all like the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_shell_n_c_10b]. Haven't managed to pick that dish apart yet, so I'm sticking to it. The trick now is getting enough of it to feed everyone.</p>      
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't suppose you have time to help? You don't seem too busy, and I really could use a hand.</p>
