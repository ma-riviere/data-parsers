          <p>Kidorun Grave Robber Band is still struggling, nyerk. The Drakes and Drakies still attack us!</p>

          <p>I think they see us small Shugos as supper, nyerk. That is why they chase us, but not Humans or Daevas.</p>

          <p>Daeva, you helped us before--you will help us again, yes?</p>

          <p>Maybe if Drakes and Drakies attacked again, they will avoid area, so we can go in and mine.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_MahishaDrakyD_31_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DrakeVioletD_33_An]s are what need to die! Daeva willing to do the deed?</p>

          <p>Ahh, good good! Just remember: [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DrakeVioletD_33_An]s much more aggressive than [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MahishaDrakyD_31_An]s. They will attack anything, Shugo or Daeva, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Huarinrinerk cannot go out there to confirm kills without first knowing if kills done! Bring back scales so I know you did your job!</p>

          <p>Should never have come here. Wish I had never heard the word "Malek." It is nothing but cursed.</p>

          <p>Not that we distrust great Daeva of Pandaemonium, but it is official Shugo policy, you see.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You probably did kill many Drakes and Drakies, but without [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2570a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2570b]s, I cannot pay you. Please understand, my reputation would be ruined if I did!</p>

          <p>Scales are kind of pretty, nyerk. Yet they were attached to meanies that caused us so much misery. Now I do not know what to do with them!</p>

          <p>Hmmm...maybe make into jewelry and sell on the side? Could be profitable....</p>
