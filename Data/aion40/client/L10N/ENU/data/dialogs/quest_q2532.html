          <p>Making a Durable Potion Bottle is simple if you have all the materials--collecting them is harder than actually making the bottle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Almost done here...</p>

          <p>And there it is. It does go pretty quickly--like I said, the hardest part is gathering the materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that's left is to deliver this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gigrite]. You don't mind doing that, do you?</p>

          <p>Shugo Express Mail it is, then, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I certainly can't take it myself. I admit, I was hoping to avoid paying the high Shugo prices, but considering how very much I care about the undead problem, it's important to me that it arrives.</p>

          <p>That's fascinating. Anyway, thank you so much for your trouble. I'll set to my task right away.</p>
