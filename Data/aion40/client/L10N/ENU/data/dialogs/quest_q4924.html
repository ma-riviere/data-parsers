          <p>Divine Power skills are special abilities that Aion has granted to Daevas. But because they're rarely used, even some veterans are rather inexperienced with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Divine Power Test is an incentive proposed by the Governor to solve that problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We call it a test, but it's really more of a training session. It ends when you use a chosen skill ten times. What do you think? Would you like to give it a go?</p>

          <p>Very good. Let me see...you're a Ranger, which means you have access to the Destruction Trap skill. That will be the subject of this test.</p>

          <p>Hmmm...the flow of your Divine Power is smooth and uninterrupted. It seems you've practiced the Divine Power skill properly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well done--you've passed the test. But continue to hone your skills--we need more Rangers like you in the Abyss War.</p>
