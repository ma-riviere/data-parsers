          <p>Dear comrades, the time has come.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is time to incapacitate the Observatory and weaken the Aetheric Field of Elysea, as great Lephar has ordered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Comrades in Belbua's Farm will raid the Tolbas Village at 6 o'clock to distract the Guardians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Guardians gather in the Village, our comrades waiting in the Cantas Coast will infiltrate the Verteron Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>BURN THIS PLAN AFTER YOU READ IT.</p>
