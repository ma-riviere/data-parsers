          <p>Purification Mechanism </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to process Odium properly, it must be melted and filtered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The melting point of Odium can be lowered by boiling the essence of Betua sap and Odium in an iron cauldron. Add the Betua sap essence regularly during the process to avoid failure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Filter the Odium liquid through a dense sieve made of woven Aria stem fibers. Any impurities will stick to the Aria fibers and be removed.</p>

          <p>Necessary Materials</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Betua sap essence: Boil three bottles of Betua sap until its volume reduces by two-thirds. To prevent the sap from boiling over, heat it at low temperature, stirring occasionally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aria sieve: Must be made of at least three-year-old Aria. Pound thick Aria stems with a stone, tear them into strips, boil them to soften, and bind them to make threads. Weave the threads tightly into a sieve.</p>
