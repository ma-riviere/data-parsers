          <p> Dear Polinia,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My dearest cousin, I know you are continuing to make me proud.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I hope everything is well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> It is such a long time since I wrote anything that I feel awkward holding a pen.</p>

          <p> I am sending this to you with a youngster who brought me an old book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> This stranger had many questions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> They helped me out a great deal, so there must be something important about this book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> However, old books are not at all in my line as you know.</p>

          <p>That's why I'm recommending them to an expert. Don't be modest; I know you too well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> This youngster is very polite and sincere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I know you are busy, but I'm sure it won't take too much of your time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I hope you and all priests are getting along well.</p>
