          <p>Day 1 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today is my first as warden of Rentus Base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is an honor, to be sure, but I almost refused, given recent events.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if my appointment was at all due to pity? But I must dismiss such unworthy thoughts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will do my best to live up to the expectations placed on me.</p>

          <p>Day 33 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have been quite busy of late. Plans to fortify our position are proceeding ahead of schedule.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Already two new structures are complete, and the smiths report that weapons and armor have been finished.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My work load increases daily, but I do not mind. It makes me feel useful, and it helps me forget.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, tomorrow we begin construction on the expansion of the Residential Zone.</p>

          <p>Day 40 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was a terrible accident today. An unstable explosive detonated, and only Raynon's selfless sacrifice prevented an even bigger catastrophe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could not help but think of Kerran. He saved many lives the day he died.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was it worth it? Many of those he saved only went on to die in later battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How many more of us need to die? How many more spouses and children have to leave behind grieving families?</p>

          <p>Day 48 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since the terrible accident, thoughts of my Kerran and Alanna come to me daily.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wrote a letter to Nillis, but I never sent it. No need to burden him with my brooding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see the casualty reports. So many lives cut short.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We fight for our freedom, but will there be any of us left to enjoy it?</p>

          <p>Day 53 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am still trying to come to terms with the news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The notification came early this morning, and I still hold the letter in my hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nillis is dead. He was displaced in a skirmish near Elementis Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My eldest son. My dear boy. Gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm all alone. All three of my children are dead now. I'm only glad their mother never lived to see this day.</p>

          <p>Day 55 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's hopeless. I realize that now. All we do is toss our children to the Worgs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We train soldiers and forge weapons and think that we can do anything against the might of Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if we bested him, another Dragon Lord would step up to replace him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We would start the same cycle all over again, and waste even more young lives needlessly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nillis. Kerran. Alanna. What did I sacrifice my children for? For a stalemate? I cannot accept that.</p>

          <p>Day 59 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have thought it through. The Reian Tribes have only one hope for survival.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur came to the negotiating table once. That means that, to some degree, they too must want this war to end.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I've heard the whispers that Fregion, mightiest of the Dragon Lords, is concerned about the Balaur's lust for blood and power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is something that can--no, must--be exploited. It is the only way I can think of to end this war before more lives are lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the sake of my children, for everyone's children, I must try.</p>

          <p>Day 72 of Commission:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I finalized my bargain with Brigade General Vasharti: information and access in exchange for the safety of the Reian Tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is no way to take Rentus without the deaths of those within. I cannot deny this upsets me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Brigade General has given a personal guarantee on behalf of Lord Fregion that these will be the last Reians to perish.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have told them much, about many things.... Things I never thought I would reveal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if I am a traitor, so be it. If no more children die, it will all be worth it.</p>
