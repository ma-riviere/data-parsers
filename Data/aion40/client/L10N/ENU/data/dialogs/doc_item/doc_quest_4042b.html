          <p>My loving sister, Sahnu, why didn't I listen to you? I gave up everything to come to Nahor Castle and be with him. Now all is lost. People here hated me, saying the lord of the castle should not be with one such as I.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He must have listened to them, because soon after that he dumped me for a young trollop named Karemiwen! Even though he said he would love me forever!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the contamination came, they fled together to Adma Stronghold and left me here to die.</p>

          <p>He locked the castle gate so that I couldn't follow him. "There's no room in Adma Stronghold for you!" he said.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone else has died of starvation or contamination. The undead are at the gates. Soon they will find a way inside. All I can do is cast this bottle from the window to the water below.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I could see your face once more. Soon I will be gone, but my hatred of those who betrayed me will continue forever. I miss you, sister.</p>
