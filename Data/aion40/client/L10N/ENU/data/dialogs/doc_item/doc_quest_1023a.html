          <p> Top Secret: For Your Eyes Only </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Observatory consists of two parts, one that transfers data to Sanctum, and the other to stabilize the Aetheric Field. First lay explosives around the tower, then infiltrate and lay explosives in the communications area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the light of Aether falls, detonate the explosives that will cut off the communication network. Then detonate the charge that will destroy the engine that stabilizes the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will not be easy to carry out this mission under the strict watch of the Guardians, but you must, for the sake of the Revolution.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Praise to Lord Lephar! Praise to the Revolution!</p>
