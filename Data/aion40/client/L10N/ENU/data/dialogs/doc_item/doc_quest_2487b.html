          <p>Day 1</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received orders from the headquarters, stating that we will mass produce RM-12b here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Preparations start today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have already inventoried necessary materials and tools, and requested supplies.</p>

          <p>Day 2</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This new equipment is not easy to install. The entire day was wasted by equipment failures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We followed the instructions but it didn't work. There must be something missing from the manual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the situation doesn't improve, we'll ask the RM to send someone. I don't know how long assistance from Heiron will take to arrive.</p>

          <p>Day 6</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Production of the test subject Pretors began three days ago;  so far all Pretors are defective.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must produce at least one valid subject Pretor in order to fix the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While still short-handed, we expect a viable subject in three days. I have heard that no one wants to come here.</p>

          <p>Day 10</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We still fail to produce viable Pretors. If this keeps up, we will never make it to the next stage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Continued delays will, no doubt, result in a reprimand, or worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The RM thinks that the researchers sent during the earlier stages should be sufficient. If a breakthrough test subject is discovered, they will demand that we commence production immediately.</p>
