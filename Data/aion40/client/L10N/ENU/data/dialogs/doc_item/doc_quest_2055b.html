          <p>Esnu my love,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your life is in danger and I am forced into action. Forgive me, but there is no time to confide in you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've hidden the Quartz Lens to prevent anyone reaching your refuge. I stowed it in a space at the top of the stairs on the castle wall at Anair Harbor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this letter reaches you safely, please retrieve the Quartz Lens and turn on the Lighthouse.</p>

          <p>My subordinates plotted with Aika to kill you and take away the key. I'm sure they're eager to plunder the Golden Temple's treasures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to negotiate with my men. Then I'll kill Aika and all will be well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I fail... I won't worry because I know you're safe. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I long to see your sweet face again. All my love, Hinden.</p>
