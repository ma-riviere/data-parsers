          <p> </p>
          <p>We are sorry to inform you that your payment is overdue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In addition, we deem your failing to inform us of your job transfer to be a breach of good faith, and must emphasize we have no intention of granting an extension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We urge you to pay the 100,000 Kinah for the goods, or to make an equivalent reimbursement.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Three (3) treasure boxes from the shipwreck on the Cantas Coast will be considered equivalent to the above amount.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please understand that we will be in a position to inform the Brigade General of your failure to make a payment unless these obligations are fulfilled as soon as possible.</p>
