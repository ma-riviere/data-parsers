          <p> Chapter 3: The Altar of the Crimson Dragon </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> We have briefly reviewed the history of the Balaur and Meslamtaeda, and have concluded that the Altar of the Crimson Dragon plays a symbolic role in maintaining the hierarchy of the ancient Balaur and the present-day Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Now we will explore the geographical features of the Altar of the Crimson Dragon and the influence of its environment on it. </p>

          <p> An unidentified toxin is currently spreading in the river-head around the Altar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Although a number of Daevas have been dispatched from Sanctum to investigate, they have failed to identify a clear cause of contamination. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Sanctum now presents an unofficial theory that the contamination may be caused by a shamanistic material that the Krall use during their rituals.</p>

          <p> Given that Meslamtaeda's domain is that of fire, it seems inconsistent that its sacred ground is located in the river-head. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> This contradiction implies that there was no river-head when the Altar of the Crimson Dragon was first constructed. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Geographical and environmental changes must have produced the river-head later. Therefore, those who study the dragons cannot view the contamination of the river-head as a mere coincidence.</p>

          <p> The Altar of the Crimson Dragon is still the holiest of holies to the Krall and symbolizes the authority of Meslamtaeda and that of the Krall chieftain blessed by Meslamtaeda. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> However, it is not easy for the Krall, whose territory has been constricted as Humans and Daevas have expanded their influence, to cross Human-controlled territory to gain access to their Altar. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Nevertheless, we can often find the traces of the Krall near the Altar of the Crimson Dragon, which means that they continue to perform their rituals under cover of darkness.</p>
