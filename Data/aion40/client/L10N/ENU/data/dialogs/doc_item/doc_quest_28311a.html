          <p>1. Siel's Relics</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Siel's Relics" are items that, according to legend, bear the power of "Siel," a Daeva displaced on Traitor's Day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These were brought to the attention of the Dragon Lords by seers who detected temporal distortions within the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat deems the relics to be of great value and has ordered the Basrasa Legion Abyss Fleet to find them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Naduka Fleets 1 and 2 conducted the search operation. A discovery was made at coordinate 239 and was supposed to be transported to Tiamaranta by Naduka Fleet 1.</p>

          <p>However, the fleet was shot down in the east of Gelkmaros and all records lost. Evidence nevertheless remains of certain difficulties in procuring and sealing the items in question.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to survivor testimony, the relics' power was extremely unstable, beyond the ability of any crew to safely seal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moreover, the relics constantly emitted energy (which, remember, originated from Aion) that caused confusion and navigational difficulties.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe this accounts for both the too speedy loss of Naduka Fleet 1 and at least some of the actions taken by Crewman Kumbanda.</p>

          <p>2. Traitor Kumbanda</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kumbanda hails from Gelkmaros. He quickly rose through the ranks and was dispatched to the Naduka Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He bears no distinctive strength in battle, but his manual dexterity was noticed by his superiors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a tour in the Abyss, he was assigned to Naduka Fleet 1, and was thus part of the search operation ordered by Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His record is otherwise spotless, with no unusual or excessive punishments noted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His camaraderie with other Drakan, his loyalty to the Dragon Lords, and his desire to ascend were all considered normal.</p>

          <p>When Fleet 1 was attacked, Kumbanda took advantage of the chaos to steal away with the unsealed relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Given his complex and perilous route to Beshmundir Temple, it is evident he planned this escape even before the loss of Fleet 1.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kumbanda used the power of the relics to escape both the Naduka Legion and the Asmodians, and to execute his traitorous schemes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While he failed to fully secure the power he craved, the fact that a single Drakan was able to stymie both legion and Daeva is unheard of.</p>
