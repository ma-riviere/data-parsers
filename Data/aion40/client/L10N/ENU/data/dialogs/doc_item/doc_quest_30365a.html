          <p>I'm faced with despair once again. I thought I had finally escaped my prison...but I only ended up in another, in this small abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I first discovered this fissure of time and space, I thought my eyes were tricking me. I thought it an illusion from not having eaten in so long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even after realizing it wasn't illusory, I was hesitant. What a fool I was--to think that I was worried I might end up in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That would have been preferable, I think.</p>

          <p>I am obsessed with thoughts of High Priest Balder lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can understand why he threw me to the jaws of death--that is how he disposes of his opponents--but how dare he pay my comrades and men to turn their backs on me! Their betrayal tore my heart apart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Annemari...I wonder if she's safe. Has she been locked up somewhere for bringing shame to her family?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must survive this place--for Annemari. No matter what happens, I will be at her side once again.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Surviving isn't enough, I've decided. I must return to Pandaemonium and give High Priest Balder what he deserves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will strip him of his status, fame, happiness, position, achievements...everything. I will take him apart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will teach him pain, make him watch everything he had worked for crumble apart before his eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He treats us commoners as if we were less than insects. By the time I'm done, he will kneel before us.</p>

          <p>Unbelievable! Truly unbelievable!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone else showed up here today. I'm sure of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suddenly sensed someone behind me, and when I turned my head to check, I saw a man staring at me. I asked what he was doing, but he opened some sort of portal, and disappeared without a word.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Was it another illusion? Has my obsession with vengeance, my loneliness, finally driven me mad?</p>

          <p>It was no illusion--the man has been showing up every day lately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is still a complete mystery to me. Despite my relentless inquiries, he has offered me no real answers, but I now have hope of being able to leave this place one day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have talked, and shared information--simply not that which I seek. He has asked about me and taught me new things--new spells and skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he leaves, I keep running our conversations over in my head and practicing what I've learned. Practicing for my day of reckoning.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>My anxiety got the best of me. I broke down today and begged the man, pleaded with him to send me back to Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He simply said it wasn't time yet. He said I wasn't ready.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That this might be some sort of...test escaped me then. I simply asked what else I could possibly need. He said that I will know when it's time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"I can't wait any longer," I cried out. As he walked away, I broke down in tears.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As he vanished, he told me Annemari is safe. He said that she gave birth to my son....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The man has not returned, not since my breakdown. And only now, after meditating on it for so long...only now do I know his identity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know what I must do. I must travel, venture out to new territories, explore them and myself. Expand my powers and knowledge. Direct my energy not towards the past, but to the road ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The past will get me nowhere. But the future? That is the road to Annemari and my son. It is the road to exacting my revenge on Balder. I will follow it to the end of time.</p>
