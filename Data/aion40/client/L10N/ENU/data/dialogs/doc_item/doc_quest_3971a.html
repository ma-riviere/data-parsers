          <p>Dearest father,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received your package. I had to wait quite a long time, but at least you kept your word.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Jade Marble was smaller than I had hoped, but it will be all right. I suppose it is pretty for an old woman.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could be granted one wish, it would be to ascend so I could remain by your side forever, father. Even after what you did to mother.</p>

          <p>They say wearing this Aether Headband will help one become a Daeva. You bought me a very heavy one, and it hurts to wear it. My neck aches whenever I put it on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Also, the Wrinkle Remover stings my skin, and it smells of Shugo stool. But I put it on every night so I can look young and pretty by your side. I know you are concerned about that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will write you again if I need anything else. Your daughter, Harmone.</p>
