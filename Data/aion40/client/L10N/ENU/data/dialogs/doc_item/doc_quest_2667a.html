          <p>Dear Paeru,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you are okay, and that someone is caring for you. I made some terrible mistakes, and now I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to come home again. I just want you to know that even if I don't come back, I love you.</p>

          <p>They told me I could become a Daeva. I just wanted to take care of you and give you a better life than you could get here. If it worked, I was going to have you become a Daeva too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They gave me some medicine and put me in a room with a lot of other people. The medicine made us tired all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes they'd come into the room and take some of us away. I tried asking them where they took the others, but they just told me not to ask questions.</p>

          <P>Now I know they were lying the whole time. I don't know what's going on but I don't think I'm getting out of here alive.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have to be strong, Paeru. Don't let anybody we know come here. Tell everybody not to trust the Lepharists.</p>

          <p>I know I haven't been the best father. But even when I was drunk and raving, you were the only one who would listen to me. Because you love me--I know that now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be brave. If I get out of here alive I promise I'll quit drinking. I'll be the best and kindest father ever. I love you so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your Dad</p>
