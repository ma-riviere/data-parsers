          <p>Heintz's Story</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was barely ascended at the time. The Balaur were determined to occupy Brusthonin and sent the Zunewgishe Legion against us. We'd all heard of them and most of us were scared, but we weren't going to run.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion inspired us to stand our ground. Without the excellent leadership of Brigade General Virkel, we would have lost all of Brusthonin to the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Ervin's Story</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My perspective may be different from others you'll speak to. You see, at that time I was still a Human. We could tell that even the Daevas were afraid, and that terrified us. We couldn't escape though, so that left us no choice but to stand up to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine Humans standing up to Balaur? My father made arrows for the Daevas. My mother cooked food for the soldiers.</p>

          <p>I carried Odella powder from the village to the camp for Daevas. They'd use it to keep up their energy for fighting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day the whole world shook, and there was fire and then darkness. It was the Cataclysm, though I didn't know it at the time. I was scared, so I ran off to hide.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must have been unconscious for some time, but when I woke up I knew I'd ascended. My parents died in the disaster. Considering what happened here later, I am glad they found peace.</p>
