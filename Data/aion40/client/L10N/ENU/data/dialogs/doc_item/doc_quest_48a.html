          <p> Dear Father,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Your letter has me very concerned.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> But I have good news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Do you remember the Daeva who acted as your messenger before?</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> That Daeva's great talents were immediately obvious to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I also sensed that the letter contained bad news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Something so bad that I might need someone strong, who could help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> So I read your letter quickly in front of the Daeva.</p>

          <p> Its message was more horrible than I had thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> So I asked the Daeva to do me a favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I knew they had a kind and generous spirit, because of the good deed they had already done for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I was proven right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The Daeva defeated all those scary guys who had invaded the farm and forced you to steal the sacred Crystal.</p>

          <p> I knew that it was a rare chance to meet a Daeva who has both the strength and the willingness to help us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> So I asked for help once more. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I had them kill the Lepharist boss, and retrieve the deed to our land, so that they cannot harass our family any more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The Daeva gladly accepted my request.</p>

          <p> Now no one will take our family estate or threaten you any longer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> All those bad guys and their bosses have been brought to justice by a kind and generous Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I would like to ask you to come over here and live with me, but I know that you will say no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> So I'll leave that alone, but I will ask you to do me a favor.</p>

          <p> Daevas are neither authoritarian nor scary as you think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> There are many generous Daevas like the one who helped us, who worry about the welfare of us Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> All the villagers know that you are not greedy, and would never dare steal a sacred item, don't they? </p>

          <p> Please go to see the highest Daeva of the village and tell him what happened to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> When I was young, you taught me that a guilty conscience sickens one's mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I hope you will be absolved of all your sins and find peace of mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I will write you again soon.</p>
