          <p>I send this message to inform you of suspicious Lepharist activity near the Observatory. </p>

          <p>At the very least, they are robbing caravans of their cargo. We obtained an encoded order (enclosed), but we cannot decipher it.</p>

          <p>I believe we should take action immediately and find out what they are up to. If they have set their sights on the Altgard Observatory, we will not be able to fight them off unaided.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ask you to take care of this matter as quickly as possible.</p>
