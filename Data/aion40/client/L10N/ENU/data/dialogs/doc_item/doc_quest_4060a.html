          <p>We finished burying the Legionaries. I made sure we planted red laize flowers around the graveyard.</p>

          <p>I won't ever forget them or their sacrifice.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>These stories about "contamination" are getting really creepy. People say they've seen strange creatures out in the forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the Balaur still wear on our minds.</p>

          <p>The contamination's real. I went to the cemetery to lay flowers on their graves, but there they were...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw them die. I buried them.</p>

          <p>There's no more safe food in the warehouse. There's no safe food anywhere.</p>

          <p>I'm glad I sent Aurtenin off to Aurleia's. He'll be safe there.</p>

          <p>Everybody says Adma Stronghold has food. It'll keep us safe from the monsters, at the very least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We packed up all we could and we're going there. It's sad to leave the village behind, but we must.</p>

          <p>I almost drowned crossing the lake...I felt the water suck me under and everything went black.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I felt my strength return ten times greater than before. Is this what ascension feels like? But I have no wings yet....</p>

          <p>The gate to the Adma Stronghold is closed. They're not letting us in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's nothing left to eat. Everything's contaminated. I thought about what eating my friends would feel like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm not hungry. I haven't been hungry since the lake. I feel strong, actually. But my skin...my face...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure I...survived the lake. Aion have mercy on me.</p>
