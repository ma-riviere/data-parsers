          <p>I send to you, Pilitas, a Daeva who holds great promise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username] has enjoyed a distinguished career after ascension, and is renowned through Elysea. I strongly believe that they will evolve into an outstanding soldier with the necessary tutelage. I sincerely ask that you give this Daeva that tutelage, as I cannot teach them any more.</p>

          <p>May the protection of Lord Kaisinel be with you.</p>
