          <p>Sit. Be comfortable. Let me tell you of the Reian Tribe and of Taloc, the Elim of Light.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so long ago, we Reians were unaware of Taloc's existence. But now, we are blessed with his friendship, and from him we have gained much knowledge and many skills that help us to fend off the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fate of my people is now bound to Taloc. So it is our story as well as his that I now relay to you.</p>

          <p>First, let me introduce myself. My name is Stephano. I was born many cycles ago, on a day not unlike today. But I was born with a slightly odd talent. I can converse with all living things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yep, even animals and plants. I understand. Apparently, it's hard to believe. My family and friends didn't believe it either, and after a few unpleasant incidents, I learned not to mention it to others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mostly, I just kept it to myself and conversed with my unlikely friends when no one else was near.</p>

          <p>That was how I first heard of Taloc. I was chatting with the blooming Aria behind our village when I overheard whispers between a Dionae and a Sparkle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>"Let's ask Taloc for help," said the Sparkle. "Taloc follows the will of Aion."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could hear them clearly, but their words made no sense.</p>

          <p>I approached them and asked who Taloc was and how there could possibly be a follower of Aion in Balaurea. They were surprised when I spoke, but accepted me fairly quickly. (Far quicker than my family!)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a short argument amongst themselves, they decided it was safe to tell me of Taloc. They had, after all, seen me fighting the Balaur, so they knew I wasn't a Balaur sympathizer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's when I learned that Taloc is an Elim that lives in the forests south of the Inggison Illusion Fortress who, with Aion's blessing, protects the creatures of Gelkmaros.</p>

          <p>The creatures of the forest had never lied to me before, so I believed their story. News of a protector blessed by Aion was so big, I tried to tell my comrades about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, you can probably guess how well that went. They looked at me like I'd been whisked away and brainwashed by the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that reaction, I knew words would never be enough to convince them, so I decided to go find Taloc and bring back proof. That very night, I packed some supplies I thought I'd need and headed off to the forest.</p>

          <p>The road through that part of Inggison is not exactly a day hike. I had rarely been out of the safety of my village before, so it was quite an eye-opening adventure for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes breathtakingly beautiful. Sometimes heart-stoppingly dangerous. Full of many hidden and glorious remnants of ancient Atreia.</p>

          <p>When I finally arrived and introduced myself to Taloc, he was cautious of me. Who can blame him? Who wouldn't mistrust a Daeva who arrives unexpectedly and can speak to plants and animals?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was patient. I stayed close. I answered all of his questions and asked few of my own. And slowly, over time, I began to earn his trust.</p>

          <p>Once he became comfortable with me, he told me his story. Taloc was originally an average tree. Middle-aged, and with his roots firmly dug into the heart of Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>During the Cataclysm, a large fragment of Aion's shattered tower pierced the ground near his roots.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As his roots grew around the fragment, new senses, thoughts and understandings bloomed within Taloc. He awakened to the world and was filled with the knowledge that Aion wished him to safeguard all the Aether creatures of Gelkmaros.</p>

          <p>Taloc explained that his roots and branches can now sense the faintest Flow of Aether from the farthest reaches of Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With his new found affinity for Aether, he called out to all the Aether energy, inviting the creatures to come and gather near him for protection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So far, he has maneuvered carefully and managed to go unnoticed by the Balaur, who were caught up in the chaos that followed the Cataclysm.</p>

          <p>When Taloc finished his story I let out a long breath.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I felt an overwhelming sense of relief wash over me, knowing that Aion's will still existed in Balaurea...followed then by an intense sense of loss for all that Aion must have been when the tower still stood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For a while, I sat, stunned by these two conflicting emotions. Then I began to understand my place in Aion's plans.</p>

          <p>It was a challenge getting my comrades to make the voyage to see Taloc. But I persevered. I knew it was Aion's will. So it was my will as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once they met Taloc, they began to develop a deep bond. One that has grown stronger and stronger over time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Aether in Gelkmaros is very limited now. Taloc can not afford to waste it protecting those of us who can defend ourselves.</p>

          <p>In the end, we entrusted our young and our elderly to Taloc's care and protection. And those of us who were strong enough to defend ourselves, we left to travel Inggison and spread the word of Aion. We offered encouragement to the strong and sent the weak to Taloc for protection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I, too, will be leaving soon, to an uncertain future. The sound of Balaur Warrior Search Squads has been heard close to Taloc's grove, and there have been increasing reports of Fanatics flooding the surrounding areas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can only do our best and hope that Taloc's powers continue to remain strong until the war is over and we are all safe.</p>
