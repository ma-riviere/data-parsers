          <p>Kumbanda's Objectives</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kumbanda was a low-ranking Drakan aboard the Dredgion shot down at Gelkmaros. During the crash, he seized control of Siel's Relics (being transported aboard the ship) and is now pursued by Balaur and Asmodians alike.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is not clear why Kumbanda disobeyed the orders of Tiamat, the supreme ruler of Gelkmaros. There are reports of a Balaur faction opposing Tiamat, but Kumbanda's actions do not appear to be politically motivated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Judging by how he took Siel's Relics and fled to Subterranea without any support, his actions seem to be purely out of self-interest.</p>

          <p>Kumbanda's Search for Mystic Altars</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Several Reian Tribesmen report sighting Kumbanda in Subterranea, where he was performing some sort of ritual with Siel's Relics at an ancient Secret Altar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reian legend tells a story of a massive Temple to Aion at Gelkmaros which existed before the Cataclysm. They say the temple contained many Mystic Altars protected by Aion with which one could achieve anything they imagined.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the temple was razed at the hands of Tiamat, the Protection of Aion was removed and the Mystic Altars were lost forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is impossible to verify the veracity of this legend, but we believe that Kumbanda was after those altars, whether or not they existed.</p>

          <p>Kumbanda's Ceremony</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe Kumbanda discovered the altars within the ruins of the ancient temple (or what he believed to be the true altars) and performed some sort of ceremony using the power of Siel's Relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In addition to Siel's Relics, Reian witnesses report the presence of a Dragon Bone, which would seem to indicate an attempt to resurrect a dead dragon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Regardless, by all accounts the ceremony was a failure, and Kumbanda fled without having revived his dragon.</p>

          <p>Kumbanda's Present Whereabouts</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A scout was sent in the last direction Kumbanda was seen heading, which was towards the Vorgaltem Battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe he is still trying to resurrect a dead dragon, which would seem to indicate that there is another Mystic Altar somewhere in Gelkmaros that he is now pursuing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kumbanda will need some time to prepare another ceremony of that scale, so we should make haste and launch a preemptive attack against Kumbanda before he can complete what could be a successful summoning ceremony.</p>
