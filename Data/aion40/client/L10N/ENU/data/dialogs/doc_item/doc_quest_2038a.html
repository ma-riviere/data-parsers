          <p>Stigma Research Journal Day 1</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Amazing letter today. He asked me what I thought about creating Stigma stones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Creating them! What a stroke of genius! I'm bitterly disappointed that it wasn't my own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, I am still the scientific genius of the Lepharist Revolutionaries. "Nobody but you," he said. Only I have the breadth of skills and knowledge to do this.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Considered various ways to extract Stigma resonance by force. Concluded that wisest method is imitation of natural Stigma stone formation process. Critical elements: spiritual matter must come from ascended source, must not be exposed to free Aetheric flow before crystallization, must be disconnected from material bonds or Aetheric anchors, and disconnection MUST be violent, preferably with strongly aversive stimuli.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am now designing devices to duplicate those conditions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, a machine to block the connection between Daeva and Obelisk. Then, a machine to extract and condition the spiritual matter.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Success! Only prototypes, not finished, but the designs are flawless and functioning. Test run soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need proper subjects for testing. These incompetents, I warned them I'd be ready, but still the cells are empty!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Muscle over mind, how I despise them! I'd use them as subjects, but they're not even Daevas.</p>

          <p>True success! True immortality. I have made a Stigma stone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No way to retest with only a single subject, but the stone is flawless. Smaller than I'd like. Note: Fine tune apparatus to increase the violence of the separation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Need more subjects to refine the process!</p>

          <p>First setbacks. Biggest problem: Not all Daevas produce stones. Possibly due to character, in part due to mechanical inefficiencies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best results with most skilled Daevas, very rare successes with recently ascended or average-level Daevas and stones of inferior quality. Humans leave only a powdery residue on the inside of the chamber.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

          <p>Aion's fetid bunions! Artificial Stigma stones are less stable than the natural ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why? My theory is without error!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need stronger Daevas who can withstand greater violence and separation times.</p>
