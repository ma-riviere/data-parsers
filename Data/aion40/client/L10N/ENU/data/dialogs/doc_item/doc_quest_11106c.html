          <p>I am Savinus, a Reian tribesman. It was many, many years ago, before the great fall of the night curtain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were Atreians just like you, and we worshipped Siel as you do. Siel loved us very much and bestowed upon us the name "The People of Siel's Spear."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Lady of Time told us to infiltrate Balaurea and clear the land of its savages, but the Cataclysm happened during the war...tore the world into two halves.</p>

          <p>It was many generations ago. Those Reians that survived the Cataclysm were stuck in Balaurea. Our fathers settled in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have endured this land for a long, long time. And I believe this is how the misunderstanding came about. We are not one with the Balaur--we simply share the same land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope your people will come to know this about us.</p>

     		  <p>Ignorant Elyos! To think a simple book will set the record straight! Can its pages undo the deaths of thousands of my people? I did not think so.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is this...is this recording now? Oh...all right...here we go. I am Gelon. My people fought for Siel and no one else. She was inside the Aetheric Field when we entered Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And during the great divide, many of my people perished. But we fought for Atreia...for the protection of Atreia. But no one remembers....</p>

          <p>You must remember, Humans were here long before Elysea and Asmodae were but a glimmer of an idea. And we served alongside them in peace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We, the Reian tribe, are the only existing race who remembers the days of peace.</p>
