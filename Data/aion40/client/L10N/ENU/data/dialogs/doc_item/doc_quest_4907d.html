          <p> </p>
          <p>Procedural Log: Transplanted Slime's poison organ to 10 Humans. 5 subjects expired. Remaining subjects suffered high fever and blue skin discoloration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Discoloration and fever subsequently diminished, being absent from all subjects by day 15. Four subjects suffered deafness, and dramatic reduction in intelligence. The sole exception will hereinafter be designated RM-108c, the others collectively RM-113b.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>RM-108c and RM-113b were moved to the Bio Experiment Lab for detailed observation.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Procedural Log: Experiment goal is to enable subject to kill large numbers of victims at close range. Primary subject is a Daeva Warrior transferred from the Eltnen Bastion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>400 varieties of poison were injected or force-fed to the subject. The visual and auditory nerves were replaced with those from RM-5c and RM-60c. Transplanted the muscular tissues of Balaur collected from Beluslan to subject.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The subject was then moved to Ormenon's Room for cloning.</p>

          <p>Procedural Log: New procedure designed to create good scouts and close quarters combatants. The cells from RM-78c were transplanted into the selected subjects. 30% of them died from side effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Testing determined that their vision and auditory senses are similar to RM-78c, but they only have combat skills similar to elite soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One Centurion was completed and sent to Azoturan Fortress for battle experience testing.</p>
