          <p>Dear Khidia,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I recently heard something exceedingly strange.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugo merchants have apparently been stocking up on explosives to sell in bulk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos I talked with insisted that he didn't know anything further about it, but said he couldn't imagine any good coming of this. He may have been faking ignorance so so as not to be culpable in whatever plot is afoot.</p>

          <p>I've heard rumors of mysterious men skulking around the Observatory. It would make a tempting target for the enemies of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I strongly recommend increased security around the Observatory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sincerely yours, Selene</p>
