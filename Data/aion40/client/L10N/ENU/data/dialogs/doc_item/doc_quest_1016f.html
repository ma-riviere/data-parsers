          <p>Dear Hygea,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the grace of Lady Yustiel be with you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am sorry to remind you of such an unsavory incident, but do you remember Meslamtaeda's Blood? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some years back, two promising toxicologists were attempting to develop a deadly poison to use against the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum was afraid of the possibility of contamination, and did not allow the pair to return. They have been missing ever since. Lady Yustiel made an antidote, but it was too late.</p>

          <p>The Daeva I have sent you came to me with a sample of Meslamtaeda's Blood, looking for the antidote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, this horrible toxin has been contaminating Verteron. The details were truly horrifying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you still have Yustiel's Tear, please give it to this worthy Daeva. It may be the key to saving Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sincerely hope that we can put a stop to this tragedy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sincerely yours, Quintus</p>
