          <p>Mystic Spring Management: Day 1</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Mystic Spring is filling up little by little.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a slow but consistent trickle, and we predict that the Mystic Spring will be filled in approximately ten days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The water is clear and pure.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The water filled up completely, but then went down a little.  We are investigating the reason.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although clear, the spring water smells like sand. Something else we must look into, I suppose.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The water level of the Mystic Spring has returned to full.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Color and smell are both normal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A peddler called Hippolytus stopped by, saying he was heading to the Eltnen Observatory on business and wanted to take a rest near the Mystic Spring.</p>

          <p>Mystic Spring Management: Day 30</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Water Level: Maximum</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Water Condition: No abnormality in color or smell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Note: Hippolytus is still camping near the Mystic Spring. He claimed that he was on a pilgrimage to the Kyola Temple. However, he looked around the temple the first day he arrived, and has been fixating on the Mystic Spring ever since. Seems shady. Perhaps I should let the fortress know.</p>
