          <p>Dear Cavalorn-</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I haven't contacted you in some time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I beg you to forgive my rudeness, as I seem to send you a letter only when I need your advice, but you are the preeminent expert on Sapien culture and politics, and I need your input.</p>

          <p>A Mau calling himself an ambassador has arrived at the Altgard Fortress. He proposed a peace treaty, insisting that his tribe--the Red Mane--has no wish to fight Asmodians. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He says he has useful information on those Mau who do continue to stand against us.</p>

          <p>Is this merely a ruse? Or is such a thing truly possible? I seek your expertise in this matter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>
