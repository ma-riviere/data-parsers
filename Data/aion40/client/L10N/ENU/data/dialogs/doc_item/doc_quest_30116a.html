          <p>The temperature of the flame is the most important factor. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In order to achieve the correct temperature, special ingredients are required.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Jotun's Flux and a special Refining Agent derived from Arachnas are best suited for optimal results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Refining Agent is just a type of Arachna poison, but it has the power to double the enhancing effect when used in conjunction with Jotun's Flux. </p>

          <p>Increase the furnace's temperature to the highest level. Then heat Jotun's Flux with half of the prepared special Refining Agent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Work the bellows until the flux is smelted, and begins to produce a blue smoke.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Add the remainder of the special Refining Agent, then heat the weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once the weapon is heated, hammer, temper, and repeat the above.</p>
