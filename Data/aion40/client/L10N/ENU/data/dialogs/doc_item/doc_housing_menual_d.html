          <p>Welcome to the Archon Studio, worthy Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>

          <p>- Coming Home -</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you received your Studio, you also were handed its key in the form of the Homeward Bound Skill Manual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By learning this skill, you ensure that home is never far away. Homeward Bound can return you to your Studio from any point in Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your home can also be accessed through the Studio front gates.</p>
