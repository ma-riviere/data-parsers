          <p>The other day, I heard some good news from one of my agents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She let me know that Guardians at the Outpost suppressed their attackers Karnif-fast, and that Wisplight Legionaries in particular made great contributions towards the Tiamaranta advance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am so proud of all my Legionaries for their courage and skill on the frontlines. Especially Rollia, whose words and focus pull together a disjoint group of shield mates and meld them into a force even better than I imagined.</p>

        	<p>Rollia, you are setting new standards for Wisplight Legionaries. Not only do you constantly show a willingness to work...not only do you exhibit creativity in solving problems...not only do you make particularly rousing and motivational speeches...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...but you also keep your eye on the real reason we're here in Inggison. Our goal isn't fighting itself nor killing more Balaur than the shield mate next to us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, we're here for the sake of all Elyos, and ultimately for the sake of all Atreians.</p>

          <p>When we take control of Balaurea, the area will become safe for villagers and artists, Shugos and Elim. From Balaurea, we'll have a base to move on to Asmodae, where we can end the suffering and barbarity, and bring peace to the misguided nation on the other side of the world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rollia, your courage, charisma, and vision have gone a long way to making the Wisplight Legion truly great. I appreciate your hard work and long hours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for everything you are doing and will do.</p>
          <p> </p>
