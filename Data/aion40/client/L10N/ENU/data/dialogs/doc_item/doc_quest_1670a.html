          <p>The lost city of Heironopolis, at last! Who knows what secrets lurk in these abandoned ruins?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So far just dust and pebbles, actually. In truth I feel rather uneasy here, like the ghosts of the Superans still live in their crumbled homes and watch me through the windows.</p>

          <p>The Poya Jungle is amazing! So green, so full of life!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been trying to make sketches of some of the more fascinating creatures but I'm afraid my drawing skills are rather limited. I shall have to recommend the place to the Sanctum Naturalist's Society.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although if there's one animal I don't much like, its the Klaws.</p>

          <p>I'm not quite sure how I got away from the Kishar Krall, but I'm glad I did. I thought I'd just be able to hide in the waterfall, and then, all of a sudden, VOOOOOOSH!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm in someplace completely different. Weird, right?</p>

          <p>I think I found the islands, but I couldn't see any bridge. I guess that's why they call it an invisible bridge, haha.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw Vingeveu, Jeshuchi, and Zapiel walking around on top, and I know Kerubs can't fly, so they must've gotten there somehow.</p>

          <p>That's it, I'm giving up. I'm blasted tired of falling into the blasted sea over and over again. I just can't blasted tell where those blasted invisible blasted bridges are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If somebody else wants to give it a try, that's fine. Let them be the first ones to discover the blasted secret of the islands. I'm done.</p>
