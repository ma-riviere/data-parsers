          <p> Dear Qydro,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> My apologies for how rushed this letter is, but I am in a great hurry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Please forgive your old father, who is writing this letter with trembling hands.</p>

          <p> The day after you came to see me, your uncle Manoa visited me as the Light of Aether was dimming and night was falling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I had no warning that he was coming; he just suddenly appeared, along with three strange men he called his fellows.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> He told me that the revolution is the only way to establish order in Atreia, and said many other things that I didn't understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Those men seemed to have been his travelling companions for quite some time.</p>

          <p> They kept talking incomprehensibly, while stuffing their faces with my best food. Then, they said that they needed the Purification Crystal, the sacred item of this village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> They argued that the sacred item in the temple symbolizes the arrogance of Daevas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I, of course, told them not to even dream of such blasphemy. But when these so-called fellows realized they couldn't persuade me, they began to threaten me.</p>

          <p> Thinking over it now, Manoa was pretty threatening as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Your uncle is no longer the man he once was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Manoa knew that the temple keys were in my keeping.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I had no choice but to steal the Purification Crystal and hand it over to them.</p>

          <p> They wanted me to leave with them and go to their so-called base.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Then, suddenly, they received a message and left in a hurry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> On his way out, Manoa told me that Belbua is not missing but dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Qydro, I believe him. What's worse is, he must have been involved in it.</p>

          <p> But that is over and done with. We must concentrate on the things we can change.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I am writing to you about the sacred Crystal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I know that the village will investigate its disappearance, and my involvement will be uncovered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> No one will believe that my own brother threatened me.</p>

          <p> I am so worried that I cannot sleep or eat at all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I may have to leave the village before anyone finds out that the scared Crystal has disappeared from the Temple.</p>
