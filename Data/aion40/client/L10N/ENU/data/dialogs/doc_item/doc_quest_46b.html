          <p> I am being held captive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> My youngest brother Manoa, whom I believed dead, appeared out of nowhere and confined me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> He has changed a lot since I last saw him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> He said that he and his friends had to do something important in my farm.</p>

          <p> This whole thing is just so shocking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Just two days ago, while eating lunch alone in my empty house, I was thinking about the old days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I got a bit nostalgic for the times when my parents, Manos, Manoa and I all lived together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Then, as if by magic, Manoa opened the door and came into the house.</p>

          <p> He looked different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> There was no trace of his old friendliness, and his bony face looked was twisted into a ferocious sneer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I greeted him warmly, but his cold expression didn't change. Then, three vagabond-looking guys followed him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Manoa called them his friends.</p>

          <p> They wanted the farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Manoa asked me to hand over the farm and the main building for their noble cause.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I told him I could not give away my father's precious farm to those brigands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> When they heard that, they started beating me. Manoa just stood there, arms folded, watching. </p>

          <p> Then they locked me up in here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Manoa himself took me to a small warehouse used as a silo, and bolted the door behind me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The next day, he brought me food.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I begged him to release me, but he showed no emotion at all, let alone brotherly love.</p>

          <p> I saw them gathering in the main building.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> They use profane language without shame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I heard them mention the Observatory, but couldn't make out what they were saying about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I have no idea how long they plan to keep me hostage.</p>

          <p> Day 7 of my captivity</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> Manoa, who used to bring me food once a day, did not come yesterday or today.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I often think about my father.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> He is so lucky not to be around to see Manoa now--or perhaps, it's that Manoa has become this way because my father died.</p>

          <p> Manoa didn't come today. I am hungry. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> I will die of starvation if this goes on much longer. They will be the death of me.</p>

          <p> I wish the Daevas or the kind villagers would come and rescue me. </p>
