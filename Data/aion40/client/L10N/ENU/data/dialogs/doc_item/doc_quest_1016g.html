          <p> </p>

          <p> Yormunad's Venom</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Extraction: Found in venom sacs in the mouth of the Yormunad. Squeeze the venom sacs for a highly distilled poison.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Antidote: None known.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As there is no available antidote, it is highly illegal for import or distribution within Elysea. The Black Cloud Traders have been known to smuggle it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Extraction: Puree a fresh root from a Moonflower that is at least ten years old. Alternatively, dry the root and grind it to powder.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Category: Mineral</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Extraction: Mix Citrin powder, abrasive powder, elemental stone powder and floating shards from the Abyss in the ratio of 2:4:2:1. Add elemental water to the mixed powder. Distill the mixture to extract the Abyss Curse.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Antidote: Cleaning the sinus cavities and the respiratory tract with Greater Elemental Water may reduce symptoms. It is impossible to eliminate the powder accumulated in the lungs. </p>
