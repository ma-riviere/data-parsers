          <p>Eradis is whining because the pumpkins are late this year.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess he bragged that he'd design a new dish or whatever, but didn't have all the ingredients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received a letter from my brother Manos this morning. He's never trusted Shugo mail, so he gave it to Gano to drop off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Manos wrote that his health has been bad lately, and he's having trouble getting about. I replied, promising to visit him soon with some healing herbs.</p>

          <p>I saw some strangers wandering about the farm yesterday.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are they crop thieves?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd better go see Manos in the Fortress, and ask Spatalos to dispatch some Guardians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I leave early tomorrow morning, I can get back before sunset.</p>

          <p>These Thieves and Peons have kept me locked up for three days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They weren't after just the crops, but the whole farm!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wish I'd done something when I first saw them hanging around--I've only got myself to blame for this situation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Manos must have received my letter by now. I'm sure he'll notice that I'm late, and send someone to the farm. He's my only hope.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>They mention the name "Lephar" a lot when they talk. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They call him "Lord" and speak reverently of him, so I guess he must be their boss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one has come from the Verteron Citadel yet. </p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>I am finished now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They finally found the land registration certificate. Now that they have it, they don't have any reason to keep me alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They gather, and speak in whispers. They must be discussing what to do with me.</p>

          <p>Hasn't Manos noticed that something happened to me?</p>
