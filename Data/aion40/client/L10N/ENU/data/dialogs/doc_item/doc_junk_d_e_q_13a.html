          <p> Gaphyrk's Prison Diary</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Day 4000 in this miserable place...oh, who is Gaphyrk kidding? Gaphyrk has no idea how long it's been. Long, long, long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When no hope of escape, time moves very slow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gaphyrk will write this to pass the time. If no rescue ever comes, at least Gaphyrk's tale will be told here. </p>

          <p>While traveling to Asmodae with Elyos goods to trade, Gaphyrk became lost. Good road on top of cliff, but this hapless Shugo could not find them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So Gaphyrk travelled all alone instead of in company of many merchants who travel the cliff top road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Other travelers on the cliff tops above, but could not find a way up to them. Gaphyrk was alone in Krall country, and very, very afraid.</p>

          <p> Gaphyrk was wandering around blindly when night fell. Panic led this foolish Shugo ever farther from safety.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gaphyrk stumbled into this Krall camp where he is now a prisoner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Krall captured this luckless Shugo, and put him in this cage.</p>

          <p>Cage is made of wooden bars, fastened together with nails. Gaphyrk tried to pull out nails, but nails were hammered in tight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then night fell and rain fell, too. Gaphyrk was cold and hungry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally Kobold brought food, and that made Gaphyrk feel a little better.</p>

          <p>Gaphyrk managed to find loose, rusty nail. Keeping eye on Krall supervisors, and pulling on loose nail when they're not looking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rest of nails still pretty tight, and Gaphyrk doesn't have anything to use as tool. Maybe Gaphyrk will die here.</p>

          <p>Pulled out that rusty nail today! Hope is good, and so is nail to use as tool to loosen more nails.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Gaphyrk pulls out enough nails in the right places, maybe able to break out someday.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Same Kobold comes every morning and night with food. Seems nicer than other Kobolds, but how can a Kobold be nice anyway? Silly thought.</p>

          <p>One more nail halfway out. Gaphyrk's fingers are bleeding.</p>

          <p>Kobolds don't care what Gaphyrk does--too busy slaving for Krall to care if I worry loose nails.</p>

          <p>Kobold who brings food has seen Gaphyrk loosening nails, and looks the other way.</p>

          <p>Gaphyrk asked her in Krallic, and she told. Won't say anything more, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gaphyrk told her in morning, not enough food. Tonight she brought two extra slices of bread. Buttered.</p>

          <p> Mimiti works very hard. Many other jobs besides bringing food to this unhappy Shugo. Hardly ever rests.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I feel sorry for her. Is that wrong?</p>

          <p> When she brought dinner tonight, Gaphyrk tried to talk her in Krallic.</p>

          <p> But she said she wasn't allowed to talk to Gaphyrk, and ran away.</p>

          <p>She left, came back with bottle of Abex milk and went away again. Never looked at me, but always away.</p>
