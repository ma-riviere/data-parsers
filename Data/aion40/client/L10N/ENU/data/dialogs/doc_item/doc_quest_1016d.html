          <p>Day 9</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum has given many scholars the task of developing a weapon strong enough to put an end to the Abyss War, but so far none have made much progress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnis and I agreed to develop a new poison--our specialty, but every formula we've tried has had insurmountable problems. We need to find something the Asmodians won't be able to counter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been haunting the Library of the Sages, but I haven't come up with anything yet. Could the clues be in the books? Could I develop a new poison that Asmodae has never seen?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We have moved our research to Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came here on the trail of information from the library, but I'm not sure whether it's fact or legend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnis read an obscure tale about the collapse of Aion's tower. It said a Balaur, killed by the shock, fell into the Tolbas Forest. He's set out looking for the body, but I hope he won't be too disappointed when doesn't find it...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we discover the body and can distill a poison from it, the Asmodians won't be able to neutralize it, as they won't know it's a Balaur-derived poison.</p>

          <p>Day 23 </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Against my every expectation, we discovered some Balaur body parts on the Altar of the Crimson Dragon, and gathered samples.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We succeeded in obtaining dried blood from one of the samples. I believe we can make poison from it but, the constituent particles are bound together in an exceedingly complex way. If we fail to analyze it properly, we may make the poison, and fail to make the antidote.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each component is very simple, but why are the bonds so complex? This really brings home how different the Balaur are from the Elyos.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We gave the name "Meslamtaeda's Blood" to the poison we made with the Balaur's blood. The Krall who used to worship at this altar call their deity Meslamtaeda.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are gearing up to mass-produce the poison and supply it to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have not, however, succeeded in developing an antidote. I don't know even where to start.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>A few days ago, Garnis dropped a vial of Meslamtaeda's Blood, and was splashed with it. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He quickly cleansed his skin, but his appearance has been changing ever since. His skin and muscles are losing cohesion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked Sanctum for help, but they said that Lady Yustiel--who might have been of some assistance--had left Sanctum, and they had lost contact with her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems we are on our own. I have to make an antidote and cure Garnis at all costs.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid I too was exposed to the poison. My skin is slowly melting. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think Garnis is secreting the poison, and has contaminated me. Garnis is no longer recognizable. He looks almost exactly like the Slimes that live in this region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If my hypothesis is right, the whole of Verteron will soon be in danger, and perhaps the surrounding regions as well.</p>
