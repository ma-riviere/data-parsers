          <p>Personal Journal. Day 1,014 of the Master Plan:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My research into Drana production continues to draw attention. My immediate superiors must admit my presence to Lord Tiamat soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The next stage of my agenda commences anon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also contemplate on a young trooper, Murugan by name. He hath a quick wit and a clever eye. We are much alike, physically and mentally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I move to transfer him under my command. I vouchsafe he will prove useful.</p>

          <p>Personal Journal. Day 1,210 of the Master Plan:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today I am become chief administrator for the Esoterrace following Warden Dathar's...unfortunate accident.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The announcement sends shocking winds through my division. The jealousies bay like whipped daggs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let them whine! Let them snarl! I say to them, thou hast sneered and suppressed me enough!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must thank the good Sergeant...no, Captain Murugan for his fine work on my behalf.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Dragon Lord Tiamat bids me appear before him before taking over the Esoterrace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For mine loyal service to the Dragon Lords, he presents me with a blade named Tiamat's Power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I still feel the assembly's glares. They loath and froth to see their pet victim elevated thus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Writhe, worms! Thou shall beg my favor soon enough!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>My plans to expand the Esoterrace continues apace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nearby Elim grow problems on their branches, but may yet turn to opportunity...given the right stimulus.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We pump Drana into the root system of the Dalia Elim, and I order the remaining area clear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reian Tribe in the area offers minimal resistance. They either flee or water the earth with their blood.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Captain Murugan wishes to slay them all, but I stay his hand for now. The Reians, like Murugan, may yet prove useful....</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Drana and my agenda both succeed beyond the realm of possibility, mayhap. My tenure here is so short, yet my progress stretches long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Elim Dalia continues to have positive impact, and my own experiments in Dragel achieve...pleasing results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the changes to my body do not go unnoticed. And the recent inspectors watch my body with untrusting eyes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the raw power populating my veins, I have no reason to hide...not much longer....</p>
