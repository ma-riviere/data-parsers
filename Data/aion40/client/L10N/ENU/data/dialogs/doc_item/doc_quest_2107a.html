          <p>Dearest Ulgorn,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I became a raider, you were there to welcome me with a smile. I was nervous about starting a new life, but you erased all those doubts with your confident "Welcome to the Ulgorn Raiders!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I didn't know it then, but that was when I started to fall in love with you.</p>

          <p>Why did I fall in love with you? Was it the way you stood alone by Tunapre Lake every night?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The way you took care of every raider and treated us all fairly and decently?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know when it happened. One day I realized it, and from then on my heart pounded every time you smiled at me.</p>

          <p>I remember last winter. It was a bitterly cold day and you saw me shivering. You gave me the coat off your back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I knew you only did it to keep me safe, but I wished you had done it because you loved me.</p>

          <p>My heart was torn apart when I first saw you gaze longingly at that pendant--the one with the portrait of your late wife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you still love her, even after all these years?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It took all my courage to smile at you and talk to you, once I knew the hopelessness of it all. But I knew that nothing I could do would make your pain go away.</p>

          <p>I never really meant to write this letter. Consider it a final chapter--a way to write an ending to a love that will never begin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can I forget my love when I am reminded of it every day I fight alongside you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I should. And one day, I will. Someday I'll see you as the boss, and only as the boss. Someday.</p>
