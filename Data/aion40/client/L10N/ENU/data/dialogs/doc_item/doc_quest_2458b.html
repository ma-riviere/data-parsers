          <p>Dear Lif </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for sending me the Roast Gadill. It's smell is wonderful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the way, can I ask you another favor? You are the expert at fishing after all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to ask you to acquire some Dorado and roast it...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, next time, I would be very pleased if you could deliver it yourself. We don't have many chances to see each other, as you know.</p>
