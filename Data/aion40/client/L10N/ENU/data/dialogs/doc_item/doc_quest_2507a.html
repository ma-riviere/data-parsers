          <p>Gigrite,</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thank you for coming so quickly to our call of distress. You are the best in all of Atreia at this sort of dirty work, and we're thrilled to have your services.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I couldn't help but notice that the situation was possibly under-explained to you, as you brought only three others with you.</p>

          <p>I want you to know that you can ask for anything you need--supplies, reinforcements, or other necessities--and rest assured that we will be glad to provide them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All you need do is ask, and I'll do my best to make it happen.</p>
