          <p>Heintz's Story</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was barely ascended at the time. The Balaur were determined to occupy Brusthonin and sent the Zunewgishe Legion against us. We'd all heard of them and most of us were scared, but we weren't going to run.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Red Sky Legion inspired us to stand our ground. Without the excellent leadership of Brigade General Virkel, we would have lost all of Brusthonin to the Balaur.</p>
