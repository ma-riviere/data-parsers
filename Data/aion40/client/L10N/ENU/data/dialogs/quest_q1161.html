          <p>My dream is to be a Manastone Researcher.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though I am a Manastone Remover now, I hope to create manastones some day. The Manastone Removers Association runs a program to support Manastone Removers like me, who want to study further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A public project is in progress to finance the program.</p>

          <p>Oh yes. The project is quite simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Association needs many manastones for students to practice on. I ruined hundreds of manastones while I was studying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, we bring in cheap manastones for trainees first, and in exchange for them, we hand out expensive ones.</p>
