          <p>Exactly! My main reason for leaving Elysea was to get away from the insects, and then when I arrive they're even bigger than at home!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Klaws. They're the ugliest of them all! Fortunately, they're also some of the most stupid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They interfere in our operations and cause so much damage to our supplies, that we can't afford to ignore them. I've been asked to organize some Daevas and have them killed--I could squeal with delight!</p>

          <p>Yes, Nezekan smiles on me, and scowls at the Klaws! Now, I need good strong Daevas for this quest! The Klaws are strong, tough...disgusting, foul, ghastly...EUGH!</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>Oh, sorry...they're strong, tough, resilient, and reproduce with impressive efficiency. Their challenger must move with great speed, strike with great strength, and defend with great vigor.</p>
