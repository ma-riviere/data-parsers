		<p>Akakak, Balaur have some of the best material for armor and weapons. Of course, I don't mean they carry it....</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Draconute leather is thin but tough and strong, so Daevas can move easily and stay protected. Naga bones are hard and sharp no matter how thinly carved.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Too bad Shugos are not strong enough to kill Balaur and get materials, akakak! But I will gladly reward you if you have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart]s or [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart_Hot]s that I can use. And...if you have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_ab1_dragonheart_fire]s, I may faint from joy, akakak.</p>

		<p>[%username], you are so brave! It must have been very difficult to collect so many Balaur Hearts, akakak.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I hope that you like the design. I chose it for you.</p>

		<p>Hot Balaur Hearts! The very best, akakak!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>No craftsman of Tigraki Workshop will say no to Hot Balaur Hearts! Here is a much better design than you can get with regular Balaur Hearts.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I hope you make good weapons with it.</p>

		<p>I need special materials to make a Balic weapon. I cannot make a sword with only Aether!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>If you come by any Balaur Hearts, bring them to me. Then I can exchange it for a Balic design.</p>

		<p>Why do you claim to have Balaur Hearts when you have none?</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I hope this was an honest mistake--Shugos cannot abide liars in business.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Next time, check your cube more thoroughly before claiming you have them.</p>
