          <p>According to Centurion Minerva, the Asmodians will widen their war in the Abyss from their base in Miren Fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That could bring our own advances to a halt. What would happen if Reshanta fell to the Balaur or Asmodians?</p>

          <p>We can't do that with an assault. Too easily spotted. But a single expert soldier could slip in, and one blade inside the walls might cripple the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1815_all] where many blades outside could not!</p>
