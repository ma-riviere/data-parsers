          <p>[%username] is a name praised by the people of Asmodae. Even you, however, cannot escape the shackles of destiny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is one who is part of that destiny. Their visage is unclear to me but their aura strongly resonates of you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This one is very strong. Even more powerful than you are, perhaps. Fear not, for they are an ally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even so, they'll need your aid.</p>
