          <p>Guarding the Observation Post is important, but spying on Balaur movements is also part of our charter...and way more fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But lately, our patrols haven't been making it very far. They end up spending most of their time fighting off other creatures in the vicinity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I swear, they've started attacking for no reason. It must be the change in seasons or something.</p>

          <p>If you're planing to hunt Balaur, and end up chasing spiders, yes, it's annoying. But...if you're all heading out for a grand [%dic:STR_DIC_M_OctasideRE_34_An] stomp, it can be great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're not very hard to kill, but their poison is nasty. My weapon of choice is always a flaming torch. Very effective, at a nice safe distance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Want to join in on the spider hunt, [%username]?</p>

          <p>You are a Daeva after my own heart, [%username]. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_OctasideRE_34_An]s roam in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_D3].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I've heard that their poison is actually what's responsible for the poor vegetation growth in the region. Weird, huh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So...have fun, but be careful!</p>

          <p>Piros said it's difficult to keep tabs on the Balaur in the area, as the Indigo Arachnas keep attacking everyone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, you hunted down some Arachnas, made a sticky mess, and were rewarded your troubles.</p>
