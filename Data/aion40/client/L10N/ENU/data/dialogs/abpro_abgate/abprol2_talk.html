          <p>You're finally here, [%username]. And not a moment too soon! The Balaur have seized Karamatis!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to retake it now if we're to have a hope of winning the battle. And as if the Orissan Legion were not trouble enough, the Asmodian Archons block our access to Karamatis. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We will take care of the Asmodians, but we need you to go to Karamatis and defeat the Balaur!</p>
