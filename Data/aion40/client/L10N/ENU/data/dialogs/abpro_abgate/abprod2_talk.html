          <p> </p>
          <p>The push to capture Ataxiar from the Elyos is faring badly. Their Legatus, Hellion, is too powerful--he defeats every Archon who challenges him. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your arrival brings us a glimmer of hope. You must go to Ataxiar and defeat Hellion, or we're all doomed.</p>
