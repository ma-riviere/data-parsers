          <p>Look at him. Teos, I mean. His mother, my sister-in-law...dead...and still he's so brave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine what it must be like for him, losing nearly everything at such a young age. I'm all Teos has left now, and he is all that I have left to treasure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My village has been swallowed up by the desert, Daeva. A lifetime's worth of belongings, memories and friends...gone.</p>

          <p>Everything but the clothes on my back. We left so fast that I had little time to get my things ready, and only managed to take my earrings and a necklace from my home. Even they've gone now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was the Lepharists, you see. They attacked us by a spring, killed some of us, then forced those of us left to hand over our possessions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were of sentimental value, of course, but I knew I was going to have to sell them when I arrived.</p>

          <p>No, I can't. We're refugees from our home, and cannot even pay our way. We're a weight on Elysea's shoulders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you help us, Daeva? I only need my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1362a] and my pair of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1362b] back, then we'll be able to survive on our own.</p>

          <p>You cannot understand what this means to me, nor can my gift to you show you, but know that my thanks are heartfelt, Daeva.</p>
