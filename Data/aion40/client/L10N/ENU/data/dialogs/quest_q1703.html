          <p>Thank you for your hard work with the Level 9 Asmodian Soldiers.</p>

          <p>Of course, I gave you the easiest mission first, to make sure that you were up to the task....</p>

          <p>Oh, so many more.</p>

          <p>You're last assignment was the Level 9 Asmodian Soldiers, which make up the bulk of their force but are relatively unskilled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This time, I need you to defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Dgrade8]s. This will further impact the army, and help ensure you're ready for the tasks to come....</p>

          <p>I knew you'd be ready for more. A true Daeva is always ready for greater challenges. Go back to the battlefield and get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Dgrade8]s you find there. Remember, as before, there will be no reward for killing those who are unable to put up a fight. That is not our way.</p>
