          <p>Information officers like me are the primary means of getting news out to the people of the city. Everything from local news like marriage and birth announcements to official proclamations from Pandaemonium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The news must be heard, and it will be heard by every corner of the city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, my voice can't be heard everywhere in Asmodae, and not every settlement has an information officer....</p>

          <p>Indeed. The Settlers Campsite in Brusthonin is barely a village, and so it lacks an information officer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Wisdom Orb Legion is stationed there, but they don't really pay attention to the everyday workers and residents like I do. The common folk deserve to be informed like everyone else!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd hand deliver the news myself, but I'm far too busy here. Maybe you could visit the Settlers Campsite and drop something off for me?</p>

          <p>Wonderful! I have a few dozen letters of all kinds, but it would be far too much to ask of you to deliver each of them to the right owner. Just take this one envelope to Vitda.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know I implied that all the members of the Wisdom Orb Legion are narrow-minded, but Vitda certainly isn't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks again for your help, [%username].</p>

          <p>Really? This is not a hard task, [%username]. You can get to Brusthonin with the help of a teleporter, and then all you have to do is hand an envelope to Vitda and you're done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You would refuse an easy task like this?</p>

          <p>Oh, another package from Feimdal.... Thank you. I do wish he would make the trip himself sometime. I haven't seen him in forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think maybe he has a crush on me. Strange, he doesn't strike me as the shy sort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I'm glad to get news. Life is hard here, and a peek at the rest of the world helps take the edge off for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll take it from here, [%username]. Have this, and rest a bit.</p>

          <p>You delivered a package to Vitda, and she thanked you for your time.</p>
