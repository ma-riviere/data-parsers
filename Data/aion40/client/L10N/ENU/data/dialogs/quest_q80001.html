          <p>I have no idea why I'm doing this. Shouldn't I be giving the blessings of the Shedim Lords to Daevas heading into battle?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead I've been put into this...outfit, made-up to look like the other Event Staff, and sent out to distribute party favors.</p>

          <p>Don't get me wrong; I like Daeva's Day as much as the next girl. But doesn't all this seem a little...garish with a war going on?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, people are having fun, so it's good for morale. And I take my job seriously, no matter what it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So! Happy Daeva's Day! Would you like a party hat and some fireworks?</p>

          <p>You know, these fireworks are pretty interesting. Wonder if we could alter the manufacturing process to make some kind of explosive weapon...?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ooh, better stop with that line of thought. I keep getting told, "Fun today, war tomorrow!" At least the Elyos are doing the same....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, now where is that stuff? This blasted Cube is stuffed full of Daeva's Day treats. Hold on just a second....</p>

          <p>Heh, I don't blame you. Too bad the Balaur don't celebrate Daeva's Day too, or I'd feel a lot better taking the day off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, well. No sense standing around pouting; I've got party favors to give out. Blood for blood, Daeva!</p>

          <p>Haha! Fine. Just trying to spread the cheer! Or share the misery. Whichever way you want to see things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, thinking back on the day so far, I've had a lot of fun. Maybe it's better for us Daevas to not be serious all the time, and remember the pleasures of life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In that spirit, I hope you enjoy your Daeva's Day. Kick back, have a drink, talk to a stranger. Maybe you'll rediscover something you've lost!</p>
