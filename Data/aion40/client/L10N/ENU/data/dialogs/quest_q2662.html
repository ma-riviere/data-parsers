          <p>That Lepharist just brought me some food. I've been friendly with him ever since I infiltrated their ranks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He doesn't know it, but he's been a big help to me in gathering information. He talks a lot. Even if his stories sometimes don't make sense, I can glean good intelligence from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this time, he told me something rather worrisome. According to him, some of their Elite Soldiers were asking about me....</p>

          <p>Well, I'm nervous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not long ago, I think I was seen talking to a chatty Daeva--you know, the fish-faced guy? I tried to get the Daeva to move on but he just kept talking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid the Lepharists might suspect something.... I need to take action before things get worse and my cover is really blown. Would you help me?</p>

          <p>My first priority is to silence that Lepharist. I only glimpsed him from a distance, his uniform was either that of a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_KeB_LehparKnD_42_Ae], a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AeB_LehparAsD_42_Ae], or a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WeA_LehparWiD_42_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since word about me already spread, it's probably safer to elimate the entire group rather than to find and kill just the sneaky squealer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By doing so, we can prevent word from spreading any further as well as divert their attention to something else.</p>
