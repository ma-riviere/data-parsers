          <p>You think I didn't try? The problem is...I can't stand ghosts. You won't tell anyone, will you? There are always ghosts where there are Windwisps, and they're so...dead. Gaaaah. </p>

          <p>Thank you! People think that when you become a Daeva you leave behind all your worries and fears, but I've got two words for you. Ecto. Plasm. It's just so...gaaaah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't tell this to everyone, but I figured you'd understand. There are tons of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Vapor_40_An]s at the Patema Ruins. If you could get rid of even 10 of them, it would make a huge difference. </p>

          <p>Tegis complained that he couldn't sleep due to all the noise nearby Windwisps have been making. He's afraid of ghosts, though, and so couldn't do anything about it himself. You got rid of the Windwisps and earned both his thanks and a reward. </p>
