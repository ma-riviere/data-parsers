          <p>Who are you? You look familiar.... Ah! You're the one who helped me get rid of those Arachnas, right? I'm terrible with the faces of Shugo.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Odd that a Shugo wields a [%mainslotitem]...I thought they preferred a ledger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait.... You're not a Shugo?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, I don't need to see a healer. I have perfect eyesight! I just hit my head while fleeing from an Arachna...and, well, it goes in and out of focus. Either way, the Arachnas are back!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The Arachna have been reproducing faster than swarms of skeletons from a slanted shack! You thinned out their numbers, and right now the monsters are just harassing the gatherers. But if more aren't annihilated, I'm afraid the situation will start to get even hairier, crawlier and creepier than it is now!</p>
