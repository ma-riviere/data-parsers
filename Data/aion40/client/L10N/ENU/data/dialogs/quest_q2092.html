          <p>The Red Sky Legion protected the fertile land of Brusthonin before the Cataclysm. Led by Brigade General Virkel, they fought back wave after wave of Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The enemy understood the importance of Brusthonin's crops to our people. Losing them could cause famine, sickness, and death. Lady Triniel ordered Virkel to protect the land at all costs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Virkel finally drove the Balaur out, but the nine legionaries perished. The Legend Shrine in Baltasar Cemetery is their tomb.</p>

          <p>Surt told you that one of the tombs of the Red Sky Legion--protected Brusthonin from Balaur--had been desecrated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you went to investigate, you found a broken sarcophagus and no sign of its occupant, Villaire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After consulting Theia the wandering ghost, you met Seznec, an old man with knowledge of spirits. He made a potion to call forth the spirits of the other members of Red Sky Legion. Unfortunately, none of them had useful information.</p>
