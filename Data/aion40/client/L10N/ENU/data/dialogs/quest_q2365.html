          <p>Before everything changed...the Elim and the trees were so different. They would call...for help, and we...would respond.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now though...we are both the same. I can only watch as their numbers are decimated. I feel their roots...binding around mine, desperate for help, and I...can do nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are too many threats...Daeva, and too little protection.</p>

          <p>Yes. The most dangerous...are the Petrahulks. They carry the heat of fire with them, and...burn all that they pass.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They must be stopped, Daeva. They...must be killed.</p>
