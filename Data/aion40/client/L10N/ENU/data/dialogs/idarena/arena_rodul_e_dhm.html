          <p>You are aware of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_IDArena_Solo_Bonus_In], are you not? Caused by Vanktrist Spacetwine, distorted the space of the Crucible Challenge, etc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We found that the Rift caused a space where dimensions of Elysea and Asmodae overlap. Attempts began to learn to control the phenomenon. The ability to place our Daevas anywhere in Elysea at a moment's notice could change the course of this long war.</p>
          <p> </p>
