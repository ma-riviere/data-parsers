          <p>I'm not sure why you're talking to me. You don't have the ability to use Stigma Stones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's kind of surprising you've come all this way without that ability, actually. You must be really strong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, let's talk again once you can use Stigmas.</p>
