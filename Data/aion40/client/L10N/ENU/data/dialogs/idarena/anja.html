          <p>Welcome to the Marchutan Priory. We may be generally known for helping young Daevas, but this place is entirely different.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here we concentrate on strengthening veterans into the honed weapons we need to break Tiamaranta's defenses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested in perfecting your combat prowess and teamwork skills, I encourage you to step right up.</p>

          <p>The Empyrean Crucible's a simulated battlefield where you and your group fight opponents in multiple increasingly difficult rounds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're defeated, you enter the Ready Room, where you may either wait for the end of the battle, or rejoin, using a Worthiness Ticket.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If at least one of the group emerges victorious, the Recordkeeper judges whether you move on or not. It's that simple.</p>
