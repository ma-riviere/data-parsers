          <p>Looking to improve in the Arena of Harmony? Maybe you should get in some practice at the Harmonious Training Center.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll even do the work of finding you a sparring partner. Remember, practice may not make you perfect, but it will certainly make you better.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, [%username], but you can't go to the Harmonious Training Center yet. You need to be at least level 46 before you can enter the Crucible Coliseum. Rules are rules, I'm afraid.</p>
