          <p>I have definitely seen you around. You must be a regular, right? Working hard at beating the Crucibles?</p>

          <p>If you've been having a hard time, you might want to check out my supplies. I've been working on some special items that give you a helping hand in the Training Grounds while you practice for the Arenas. Now, they don't work in the Arenas or the Crucibles themselves, mind you, just in the Training Grounds.</p>
