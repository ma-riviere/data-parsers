          <p>Another Coliseum pretender? Even if you are familiar with the other Crucibles, you'll find this one is not so simple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll pit yourself against the toughest of competition--other Daevas. In the Arena of Discipline, you fight one-on-one, and in the Arena of Chaos you engage in a free-for-all battle against several opponents. The Arena of Harmony has you team up with another Daeva, and the Arena of Glory is for the best of the best. Would you like to hear more detailed rules?</p>

          <p>Well, they stationed me here to answer endless questions from contestants who've taken one too many blows to the head, so I suppose I'll be around if you forget.</p>

          <p>Did you get all that? The Arena of Chaos is a little more complicated than the Arena of Discipline, because there are more opponents. It's still pretty straightforward, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd rather explain the rules to you again than have you go in there unprepared, so come see me if you forget.</p>

          <p>The Arena of Harmony is one of our more complex challenges. Only Daevas who can fight as a team are ready for this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can repeat the rules again whenever you like, but just keep in mind that that can't give you the power of teamwork. Teamwork is the only thing that will help you inside the Arena of Harmony.</p>

          <p>Only members of the Marchutan Priory may participate in the Arena of Glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Renown outside the Priory counts for nothing here; all Daevas, must prove their worth before we will grant them tickets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reach one of the higher rankings in the Arena of Chaos or Harmony, and we'll consider letting you compete.</p>
