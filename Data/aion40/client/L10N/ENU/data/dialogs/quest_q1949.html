          <p>Daeva must listen well. Garkbinerk will only say this once.</p>

          <p>Information on Vindachinerk is highly valued, yes? Carries a significant fee, and Black Cloud Traders always collect. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since Numonerk sent you...you must tell no one of this.</p>

          <p>Wise Vindachinerk is here. In Reshanta. Such a skilled Shugo is sought by many and must be protected.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <p>To meet Vindachinerk, you must bring gifts--or be dismissed before speaking.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva can do this, yes? If not, give up now!</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_7] is wise and knowledgeable. Only eats nutritious food. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1949a]s are his favorite.</p>

          <p>If Daeva brings those to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_48], the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_53], or the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1_44], Daeva will have chance to speak.</p>

          <p>Vindachinerk moves often. Daeva should wait in one place, rather than search all three.</p>

          <p>At her recommendation, you collected the whiskers of an Steelback Ksellid in Eltnen and gave them to Vindachinerk. However, Vindachinerk said that the Black Cloud Traders had sent so many people with Ksellid Whiskers that he is no longer interested in them.</p>
