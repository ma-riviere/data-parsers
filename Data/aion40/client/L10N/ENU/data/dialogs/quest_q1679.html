          <p>One of the advantages of being Human is growing old with the ones you love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I count myself truly blessed to live happily with my wife Heraloene. </p>

          <p>We're both healthy. I don't want anything else.</p>

          <p>As men grow old, they become more and more grateful for their wives. They give us so much, and the things that are truly important we are too shy to give as young men.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never cooked for my wife when I was young. I feel terribly sorry about now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not too late, though--I'd like to cook something for her before I die.</p>

          <p>Not these days. Her favorite dish is Spicy Litreas. But there's a problem in cooking that for her. There are plenty of Litreas in the waterside, but also plenty of Crasaurs and Starturtles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I was young, I could get around them easily. As an old man, not so much. But you, you'll be young forever.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you help me, I think I can make the Spicy [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_shell_n_c_40a]s for Heraloene. Daeva...could you help me?</p>
