          <p>Oh, of course! It's the [%dic:STR_DIC_Xmasevent_001], isn't it? I forgot all about it--I've been wondering why everyone looked so excited.</p>

          <p>First, visit [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_8] and ask for his finest wine. I'll need it by tomorrow, no matter how expensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lidorasa]. She'll be somewhere around Prosperity Road. Tell her to come to the Airship Dock at twilight in two days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If she agrees, I'll need you to book a gondola through the Airship Dock manager, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fjuedil]. I'll need it from twilight to midnight in two days. If you tell him it's my request, he'll surely accept it.</p>
