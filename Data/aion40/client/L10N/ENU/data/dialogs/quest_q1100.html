          <p>Good, you're here. I trust you've come to grips with mercenary life by now, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The other mercenaries can guard the village and keep an eye on the local [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA18]s for now. I called you here because you've caught my eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've something of a test for you to complete. Now's your chance to shine.</p>

          <p>I have some contracts from the villagers, and I'd like you to complete some jobs for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here are your first four contracts. There's a fifth, but it's risky, and I'll only give it to you when you've completed the rest. If you can't manage the first four, there's no chance you'll be able to get through that last one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd suggest you start with the easier ones to find your bearings and get yourself used to the local flora and fauna. Faith and arms, [%userclass]!</p>
