          <p>My work connects me with every place in Atreia, and people ask me for all sorts of help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most often, they ask me to hold goods for pick-up. It's not that difficult, just boring at times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes, though, I get orders for shipments to the Outer Port. I know it's not easy for them to come this far, but I can't run all the way to the Sanctum Outer Port whenever I want.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phokas], the port manager, usually comes by, gathers the goods and loads them on outbound transports.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he hasn't been by in a while and now I have stacks of goods to move. I'd do it myself, but I can't leave my post.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>[%username], how about taking these there for exercise? I can't pay all that much, but it will help if you need money to go to Verteron or Eltnen.</p>

          <p>Polyidus, the Teleport Master, helps visitors to Sanctum with their belongings and occasional deliveries.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>He usually keeps things and gives them back to their owners later. But the Outer Port is so far from his post that he sends goods to Phogus in the Passenger Ship Port.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>When you visited him, he asked you to take some for him. You delivered the goods and received a reward.</p>
