          <p>As you might expect, Sanctum is extremely concerned about Dark Poeta, for a variety of obvious reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have charged me with a great deal of latitude and authority to investigate it, in order to determine a way to keep it from becoming firm reality.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As such, I have a sensitive mission that can only be undertaken by a Daeva of strength and will.</p>

        <body>
          <p>My primary concern is studying the unique forms of Drana found there. But it's not easy, since obviously the Balaur put Drana there to be used.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every bit of Drana consumed both strengthens the Balaur and keeps me away from precious samples I need to analyze and study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need you to do is to go to Dark Poeta and destroy some of the major consumers of Drana to give me some space to work.</p>

          <p>You have several possible targets. First, there are the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem1_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_NM_WaterGolem3_50_Ah] at Lake Maravata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Additionally, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_F_Spaller_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_STR_IDLF1_F_Spaller2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_STR_IDLF1_F_Spaller3_50_Ah] lurk in the Drana Fields.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, you could destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_BionicCPU_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator1_50_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator2_50_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF1_Generator3_50_Ah] in Timolia Mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All of these targets will be hard to reach, and even harder to destroy. But Sanctum and I feel that this is vital. I know you can do it.</p>

          <p>I refuse to send Daevas who are in danger of failing this mission. Time is of the essence, and this is too important to leave fallow long.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I appreciate your forthrightness. If you are not absolutely confident in your ability to succeed, I thank you for not wasting time.</p>

          <p>Dark Poeta is a...heartbreaking place. Anyone who's been to Poeta in the present has been filled with grief seeing what the Balaur did to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or is it "will do"? "Could do"? I must admit that time travel and alternate planes of reality are not my specialty. Fascinating, but not my specialty.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>If you'll excuse me, I have much to do now. I must collect Drana samples before more consumers rise to claim it.</p>
