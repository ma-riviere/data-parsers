          <p>Ugh. I'm wasting my time here. How is any of this going to improve my battle record? My sister on Kysis Isle has already won a couple of medals!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moinn is my sister, one of the most promising young Archons. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hate being compared to her, but it never stops. I came here looking for one last chance to catch up. Reshanta's dangerous, but great risk means great rewards!</p>

          <p>Yes, well, I'm supposed to hunt Fire Spirits. I begged Centurion Radgrid to send me to the front lines, but he says "A Daeva needs broad experience in fighting Aetherial foes, starting with spirits."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that demonstrates is his ignorance! If he bothered to check, I've fought hundreds of battles against spirit creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what I'm saying is, do you want to earn some money? I hate to foist this off on you, I just need to finish it quickly and I could use the help.</p>
