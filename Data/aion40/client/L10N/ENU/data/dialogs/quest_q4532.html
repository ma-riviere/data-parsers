          <p>Help? Haha...yes, it is true the Asmodians know the meaning of the word, but only towards each other. To help another, to help an outsider, seems to go against the Asmodian spirit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, perhaps I am wrong. You are here after all, and it seems you may be able to help me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mine is a problem of a base nature. Nature's grasp is being loosened by agents of change: creatures that care little for the flow of things, only for their own self preservation, as preserved as they are....</p>
