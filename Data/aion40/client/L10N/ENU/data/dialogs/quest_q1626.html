          <p>You probably think the torches are a silly idea. Did you ever hear about Calon? The people of Calon were allegedly saved by these very torches--and legend has it that the people in the camp when the torches are lit never die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if it isn't true, if the troops believe it, it could give us the advantage we need. Faith is as important as strength, yes?</p>

          <p>The lives of my soldiers are my responsibility, [%username], and I will do whatever is necessary to bring as many as possible safely home again. I know what our odds are against Bollvig. If a torch can make the difference, I will absolutely use it. </p>
