          <p>[%username], it's vital that we deprive the Balaur of their weapons and supplies...but I've been toying with another plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead of simply destroying their arms, I'd like to steal them...send them to Sanctum for research, maybe give some to our troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That would kill two crows with one arrow, right? Take from them, give to us....</p>

          <p>Yes, I would agree with you there. But you've pulled off every task assigned to you thus far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you're headed to the Chantra Dredgion, see if it's a possibility. See if you can snatch some of their supplies in the process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you handle it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>I'm not asking you to bring back their entire arsenal, Daeva. Try and get your hands on those [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDreadgion_02_Drakanbox_Q3723] of theirs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can destroy everything else, but bring back those supplies! They should be in the Supply Warehouse...or check the Shulack Workers. It's there somewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I realize you'll have your hands full with fighting those savages, but just see what you can do.</p>
