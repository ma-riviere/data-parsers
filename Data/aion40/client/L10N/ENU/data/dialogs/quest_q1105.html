        <p>Days likes today strike misery in my heart, mercenary! Why farm when all my hard work is devoured by beasts, hmm? I see no sense in this struggle.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>If I could fight, I would, but I've no training, and the creatures are impervious to my blows.</p>

          <p>Of course you can, but I thought I had to speak to you via Polinia! If not, I could certainly use your help.</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>It's the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA132]s, my friend. They're sucking up all the seeds I plant, and ruining entire batches of crops in mere minutes. I need them dead before all is lost!</p>
         <p> </p>
         <p>Could you help? I have a little Kinah left over that I could part ways with.</p>
