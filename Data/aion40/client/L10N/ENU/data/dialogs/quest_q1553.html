          <p>Here's the mirror you need. You should know, however, that it isn't enough all by itself. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't look at me like that. I said I'd made it before. That mirror has one use aside from self-admiration--bypassing mirage magic. And the only place with the sort of magic that needs bypassing is...yes. Alukina's Palace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not a mirror so much as a container. It will hold light strong enough to break through a mirage. You still need to find a source for sufficiently bright light, though. </p>

          <p>Erato might tell you to make offerings to Aion, but there are more practical solutions. The Daeva who last asked me to make one spoke of a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2_NPC_TalkingMirror] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_toDF2_DFlame] in Morheim, Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Assuming you can get to the mirror, it should be able to give you the light you need. Of course, it may not be inclined to help you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, that's your problem, not mine. Beg, blackmail--you'll find a way, I'm sure. Of course, you'll need to get to the Fire Temple first, and that's no simple task. Are you sure you're up to it? </p>

          <p>Well, you don't back down from a challenge, at least. If you're looking for a way across to the  [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_toDF2_DFlame], you'll probably want the rift that opens near the Kyola Temple in Eltnen. Do you have someone to go with you? It's a dangerous place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you get the mirror to agree, take the captured light to Brigade General Perento at the New Heiron Gate. He'll know where to find the rift that leads to Alukina's Palace.</p>
