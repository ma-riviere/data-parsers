          <p>Children these days...no respect for anything or anyone. When I was young, I helped everyone I could. Especially the village elders, who worked themselves to the bone so we could survive and eventually prosper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then I'm sent out here, and everyone is so busy with their "glorious" raiding that they don't give a moment's thought to their elders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you're new here. Are you chasing the fleeting glories of a raider's life like everyone else?</p>

          <p>Not just your name, child. I know all sorts of things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, as I said a minute ago, I helped my elders when I was young, and now I need help. The leader of your little gang wants quilted garments to wear under his armor. In itself, that isn't a problem: I am a tailor, after all.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I need the materials: feathers from several [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HiivD_3_n]s. They can be found all around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_3].</p>
