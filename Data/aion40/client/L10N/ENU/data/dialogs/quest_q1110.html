          <p>You would not know it to look at me, but my father works as a librarian in [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA07]. He's quite the learned man and keeps sending me books from the Sanctum Library.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is, though, I'm not the fastest reader in the world, and I don't really get that much time between shifts to read. I end up sending most of the books back unread, but I do lend some out to my friends when I can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A few days ago, [%dic:STR_DIC_LA10] asked me if I had any books about nymphs. Why a woodcutter would want such a book is beyond me, but I had none and had to let him down. But, that was then...</p>

          <p>Yes. Another shipment of book arrived from Sanctum today, and among them was [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA73].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure if it's exactly what Namus is looking for, but it's better than nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you take it to him for me? I'm on duty, and I will be for a good while, yet. By the time my shift ends, Namus is usually fast asleep.</p>
