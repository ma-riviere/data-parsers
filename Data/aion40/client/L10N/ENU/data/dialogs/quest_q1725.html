          <p>A few days ago, Brigade General Calon asked me to send supplies to some soldiers in the field, and I forgot!</p>

          <p>By now they'll be starving, and my Legion's shipping out. I have to do something. The general will be furious.</p>

          <p>Maybe you could help me, [%username]? Will you deliver the supplies in my place?</p>
