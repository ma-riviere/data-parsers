          <p>Om nom nom.... Oh, [%username]! Pardon my rudeness. No, that is definitely not a scrambled Arachna Egg.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Okay, it might be a scrambled Aracha Egg, but I have to eat too! I sent most to my family...just like I promised I would.... They sent their regards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now my wife just had another baby! My family keeps growing, and I'm worried they won't have enough to eat.</p>

          <p>Only if you have time to spare for a starving family...I mean, my youngest might perish, but I have many sons and daughters.</p>

          <p>It would be great if you could lend a hand. You don't have a regular job like me, so you have plenty of time to fetch some eggs, right? I'm sure little [%username] will appreciate it. That's right, I'm proud to have a child who shares a name with such a venerable Daeva....</p>

          <p>My deepest thanks [%username]. Please, go to Octanu's Lair and bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_OBJ_DF2_OctasideEgg_Q2329]s. </p>
