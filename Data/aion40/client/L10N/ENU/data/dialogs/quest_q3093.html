          <p>Oh, Bororinerk's Shugo tummy hurts. So much stress trying to sell things here. Do you know how many Minor Power Shards Bororinerk must sell to cover costs?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Bororinerk sold as many as Jamanok sells meat dumplings here, would be rich! Rich!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between Daeva and this humble Shugo, is something "special" about dumplings here. People can't leave the inn because they love dumplings too much! Akakakak!</p>

          <p>Scrumptious? Hmmm...didn't eat any--Bororinerk is vegetarian. But all who try dumplings marvel at taste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such a pity such wonderful dumpling sold in this remote, remote village, nyerk. If only Bororinerk could get recipe, would hire Kobold cooks and open big dumpling restaurant in city. Profit galore!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no matter how Bororinerk peeks around the kitchen, no recipe.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Bororinerk will leave this place as soon as recipe is in my paws. Will borrow Kinah from Shugo Traders at reasonable interest, open dumpling restaurant, and become rich by selling them to people who can't get enough! Akakakak!</p>

          <p>If butler doesn't know, get some dumplings from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_LF2A_NPC_Jabala] and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hestia] in Sanctum. Cooking Master like Hestia can analyze for recipe! Akakakak!</p>
