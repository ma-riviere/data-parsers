          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. I don't know if you're aware, but the Manastone Removers Association is currently under new management.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our organization lost all Sanctum funding during the recession that followed the invasion of Balaurea. So we unionized, turned a profit, and started financing our own operations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I'm looking for today is HP +30, Accuracy +14, and Block +14 manastones. This savory deal only works in bulk orders, so I need bundles of 10 only. Can you do something like that?</p>

          <p>On behalf of the Manastone Removers Association, I would like to thank you. Your business keeps us in business, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Search your cube and warehouse for all the HP +30, Accuracy +14, and Block +14 manastones you can find. I have clients lined up and willing to pay top Kinah for them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In return, I'll give you some foreign manastones the likes of which you've never seen before!</p>

          <p>I understand your concern, Daeva. Even I don't know where these old manastones will end up...or in whose hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's the problem with becoming a for-profit business. We're still doing a service--a good service--just not necessarily only for those walking in the light.</p>
