          <p>Who knows? Not Chantinerk. Jeckrow ordered wine from Javirunerk, but wine didn't arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Javirunerk should have brought it three days ago. Not good for credibility of Black Cloud Traders, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Javirunerk tried to replace shipment, but Sandblossom Wine season has ended, nyerk. No more until next year at any price, nyerk. Daeva will tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Genpels] that Javirunerk will replace wine next year? Yes?</p>
