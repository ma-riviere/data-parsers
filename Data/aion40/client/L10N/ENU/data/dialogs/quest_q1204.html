          <p>Well, we can't deal with a crab infestation and keep watch on those strangers up the coast at the same time. We have to protect the Observatory.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Daeva. You know the drill. Go and hunt the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA150]s nearby and bring back their [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA88] so we can keep track.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Five should be enough for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe we should scatter all those severed pincers on the beach, as a warning. They'd probably eat them, though, and breed even faster. </p>

          <p>The number of Potcrabs inhabiting the Cantas Coast has suddenly exploded, putting the Guardians at the Observatory in an awkward position.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They can't leave their posts to cull the Potcrabs because of a suspicious shipwreck further up the coast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You helped them by hunting Potcrabs and bringing back their Sharp Pincers as a tally.</p>
