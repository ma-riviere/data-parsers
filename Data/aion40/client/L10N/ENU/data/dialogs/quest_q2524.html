          <p>The Mosbears have gotten incredibly violent lately--more so than usual.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard they established a new leader, and that he's the one firing them up.</p>

          <p>I didn't notice them at first, being so caught up in the undead situation, and helping Gigrite with that mess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It didn't take too long, though, for me to really start to see the problem they were becoming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, because the situation with the undead is still so far gone, it's hard to find time to get out there and take care of them. I don't suppose you have some extra time?</p>

          <p>Great. In the Mosbear Snowfield, you'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearReD_33_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearReBigD_34_An]s. Those are the ones you need to defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck, and be careful. Report to me when you're done.</p>

          <p>How embarrassing for a strong, well-known Daeva like you to be afraid of a simple creature like that. Hmph.</p>
