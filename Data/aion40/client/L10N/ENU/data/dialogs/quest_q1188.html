          <p>Excuse me! I've been waiting all day for someone to come along, and I've got a good feeling about you. Perhaps you can help?</p>

          <p>I'd like you to find someone for me. You'll need to go to the Verteron Observatory on the Cantas Coast.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You will find Notos there. It is he that I must contact. Will you pass on my message?</p>

          <p>You will? I knew I was right to ask you. When you find [%dic:STR_DIC_LA35], tell him this: "The Pluma's tail feather is not black."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You need say nothing more than this. And the words must be exactly as I have recounted them! No room for poetic license on this mission, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must ask for one last thing--absolute discretion. You cannot mention this to anyone! Not a soul. Sorry to be so mysterious, but it is a necessity!</p>

          <p>Morai, a Centurion guarding Miraju's Holy Ground, asked you to go to the Cantas Coast and pass a cryptic message to Guardian Notos of the Verteron Observatory.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>When you related the message, Notos was startled. You still don't know what it meant.</p>
