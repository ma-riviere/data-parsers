          <p> </p>
          <p>It's already been a while since I spoke to him, and it seemed quite urgent. No idea what it's about. Why don't you go and ask him directly?</p>

          <p>That's the spirit! I mean, what's the point in fighting all these Balaur if we make life so serious and boring? It's what makes us different from the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, they do have some things in common with us. For instance, they have to train their soldiers somewhere. In this case, the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_L]. I'd like to strike at them before their next set of trainees graduates and starts causing us trouble throughout Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have a think about it, and let me know what you decide.</p>
