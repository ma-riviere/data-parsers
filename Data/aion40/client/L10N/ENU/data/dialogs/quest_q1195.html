          <p>We're unsure what the Krall are planning, but whenever they get hold of Odium, they inevitably try to use it to open portals to the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They crave the leadership of their Balaur masters, you see. Were the Balaur to come through, the Krall would be unstoppable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have enough information for Sanctum to send reinforcements, which have been formally requested--again--but we must begin now. I refuse to hide in the citadel and wait!</p>

          <p>I have given the matter a lot of thought. The Krall army is like a beast...and we must hack off its head. We must eliminate [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA37]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This won't be easy. As we know from your report, the lair is heavily guarded. Kraka himself is a veteran warrior--strong, vicious, and lethally intelligent.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without a leader, though, the Krall will fall.</p>
