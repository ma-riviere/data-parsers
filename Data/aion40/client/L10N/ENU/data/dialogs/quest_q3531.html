          <p>One of the worst things about being so well-informed is that I hear the bad news long before anyone else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could tell you some of what I know.... Well, maybe it's better that I can't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's especially bad since I can't know what the generals will decide to do about it. Take this one report here....</p>

          <p>What? Oh, this one should be fine. In fact, I'm going to be asking you to do something about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might have heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterNM_47_Ah] of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF3_Castle_Indratoo]. Intel says he's planning something...something big.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no clue as to what it is. But whatever it is, it can't be good. I need someone to go in and kill him before his plot comes to fruition. Specifically, I need you.</p>

          <p>I thought you'd see things my way. But as I'm sure you realize, Indratu Fortress will not be easy to penetrate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not to mention the fact that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterNM_47_Ah] himself is a Drakan of fearsome strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I wouldn't have asked this of any Daeva if it weren't absolutely necessary. He must be stopped.</p>

          <p>I'm glad you were honest with me. This mission is too important to give to those who doubt their will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, I'm not going to be petulant and stamp my foot and scream. If you don't feel you can do this, I won't try to argue. As I said, this is too important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry, but I can't spare another moment chatting. Time is of the essence. I must find someone to take on this task at once.</p>

          <p>You're back! I've been trying to contact Sanctum about [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterNM_47_Ah] almost constantly since you left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're trying to find a free Legion to invade [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF3_Castle_Indratoo], but as you expect, there aren't that many to spare.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, with any luck this is moot. Report on Brigadier Indratu, at once!</p>

          <p>Good. We still don't know what he was up to, but hopefully, his death has at least severely slowed down his plans for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send a team to raid the place immediately. Maybe we can find some clue as to what the larger goal was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But your part in this has ended, and quite successfully, I might add. Please take this as your reward.</p>

          <p>Daeva of Zephyr Graa was worried that Brigadier Indratu was planning something serious, and sent you to stop him before it could occur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to Indratu Fortress and slew the vicious Drakan. You returned to Graa's praises, and a respectable reward.</p>
