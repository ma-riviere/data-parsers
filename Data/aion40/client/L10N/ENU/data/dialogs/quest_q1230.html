          <p>Did you know I used to live on the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Combine_Rookie]? I really loved my training and the comrades-in-arms I met there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most people go for a short while, and then come back to normal life, but I was really thinking of staying. Then, I had to give up my training to come home and nurse my sick mother. I don't resent it, really, but sometimes I miss the life I had.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you do me a favor? I promised to keep in touch with a friend there, Madeline, and I've written her this letter. If you're off to the Fast-Track Server, would you deliver it to her? You know how to get there, right? It's easy. Just go to "Menu," then "Go to Channel," and then "Go to Fast-Track Server."</p>

          <p>Oh, great! I thought for sure he wouldn't keep his promise to be my pen pal, not once he got back to his old life and his old friends, but I'm glad to hear from him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aww, that's sweet. He says he misses me and that his training isn't the same...</p>

          <p>Well, thanks for delivering this.</p>
