          <p>Thank you, [%username], for helping us to remove that horrendous stench from the swamp. But, I'm afraid, that's only part of the problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The smell may be gone now, but so are our guards there! Same in Jeiaparan Village. We're left defenseless in both places at the moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could really use your help at the Black Tears Swamp still. We're stuck there until that stench is completely gone from the southern road to the Decayed Grove.</p>

          <p>That's exactly why we need you! That wretched aroma comes from Contaminated Spirits, not bog gas like I originally thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need someone to go in there and kill those lost souls. Use magic, use a sword, use a rock, I don't care...just get rid of them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're full of rotten soil and the festering waste of a thousand creatures. They must be destroyed. Will you help us?</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you, [%username]! You can't imagine what this is like. I haven't been able to eat in days because of that pungent aroma.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, get rid of any and all [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_34_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_35_An]s on the southern road to the Decayed Grove.</p>

          <p>I know that a proper Daeva isn't supposed to complain about conditions on the battlefield but, sweet Lady of Light, a little help would be appreciated!</p>

          <p>We're out here risking life and limb for the safety of all Elyos while those tea-sippers in Sanctum whine about the state of the theatre scene. I mean, just a portion of their theatre budget would save the lives of hundreds of soldiers out here!</p>
