          <p>I'm afraid the manor is in rather a state of disrepair. Thieves and vandals have made off with much of my lord's art collection--a collection that was quite exquisite in its day, I assure you.</p>

          <p>To make matters worse, the thieves don't even appreciate the proper value of the items! Why, just the other day I saw a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Graveknight_42_An] walking about with Lord Medeus' antique [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1599a]--using it as a shield! A shield!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This effrontery must not go unpunished. I implore you, hunt down this errant Graveknight and retrieve my Lord's mirror.</p>

          <p>Yes, this is indeed the Bronze Mirror my lord once held dear. As I feared, that idiot Graveknight has mistreated it badly, but I shall polish it until it shines like new. After all, I have nothing but time on my bony rotting hands.</p>

          <p>Kacias lamented that his master's art collection had been thoroughly plundered and mishandled. Even his antique bronze mirror was being used as a shield by a Graveknight! You taught the Graveknight the error of his thieving ways and returned the mirror to Kacias' care.</p>
