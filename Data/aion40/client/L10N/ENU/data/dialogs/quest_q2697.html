          <p>They want me to recover a book stolen from the Hidden Library of Pandaemonium. A book about the Empyrean Lord Israphel! What's that compared to a Human life?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should take the mission instead of me. It makes me sick just to think about it.</p>

          <p>Dewi got an order from the Shadow Court to recover a stolen book, but he found it distasteful to rescue books instead of people. You accepted the mission for him and he suggested that one of the prisoners in the Alquimia Research Center might know where the book was taken. You found a prisoner there who was still talking, but he slipped into unconsciousness....</p>
