          <p>As a youth I wanted to be an Archon. When I reached the test of the Temple, though, I couldn't pass it. It seems enthusiasm is no substitute for skill at arms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It all turned out okay though, because I ended up training to be a manastone remover and I love my job. Better a good manastone remover than a lousy Archon!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh! I got a letter form the Manastone Removers Association! Let me tell you about a fabulous new offer!</p>

          <p>It's a trade-in program to benefit the children of injured and disfigured Manastone Removers. This is a dangerous job you know! That circuitinizing hook takes finesse to use. Put it in at the wrong angle and it could deflect right into your face!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The used stones will be used for training. Students ruin a lot of manastones, so we don't train with nice ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're interested, I'll explain what kind of manastones you need to bring.</p>

          <p>Oh thank you! Bring me MP +60, Evasion +12, and Parry +20 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have to be exactly the kinds of manastones I said because of the regulations. For each set we gather, sponsors will donate to the fund for the kids.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you bring the three manastones, I'll exchange them for a better one, and you'll be helping children!</p>

          <p>What do you have against children? Or is it that you don't like new manastones?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wait...are you removing your own manastones? I hope not. If youâ€™re not a member of the Manastone Removers Association, sometimes accidents can happen when you remove a manastone. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes they happen later that night after you go to bed. If you know what I mean.</p>

          <p>I don't know what kind of research the association does. It's very secret. Manastones are a very competitive business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just hope they can develop a manastone removal method that's less dangerous. I mean, look at these tools. Make one mistake with that spline reticulator and you could take off your whole hand. That's why we have the MRA to look out for us.</p>

          <p>We've got an immediate use for those types, so we're specifically looking for them. That's part of the reason we're doing it right now. Thanks!</p>
