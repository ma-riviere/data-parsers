          <p>Don't worry, it isn't difficult. All you need to do is to get me five pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_tree_d_n_c_20a] wood.  I'm cooking soup right now and there's not enough firewood. </p>

          <p>I'm being specific for a reason. Please bring me only [%dic:STR_DIC_E_tree_d_n_c_20a] wood. Its strong heating power lasts a lot longer in this frigid weather.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It should be easy to find the Wrud trees, since they are spread from here to the Morheim Snow Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There isn't much firewood left. Please hurry!</p>
