          <p>Daarunerk believes the book Daeva wants is this one. Very old, very hard to translate. Easiest title is "How to Minimize Damage Inflicted by Balaur."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fifth part says, "How to put out Balaur's flame." Is good, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or perhaps another book will do. Have seen "Young Daeva's Guide to Recognizing Enemies" recently.</p>

          <p>Good, good. Very hard to read ancient Atreian languages. Might have been cookbook--never can be sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Book says Fregion's Flame happened long ago, before the Cataclysm. Much suffering, until a Daeva summoned "Magic Ward of Coldness" to put it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daarunerk does not judge, but sounds like Brax patties. Also lists ingredients for summoning, if Daeva would like to learn.  Hard to find, very rare items.</p>

          <p>Good, good. Is nice to see young Daevas with thirst for knowledge. Daarunerk prefers hard cider, but knowledge is good too, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Book says summoning scroll needs five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3082a]s, five [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3082b]s, and one [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3082c]. Not written in book is how to combine ingredients, but is small thing. Tiny detail. Most likely not very important. </p>

          <p>Lucky for you, Daeva who made ward is probably still alive, yes? Name is written here...Se...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Seora]. Go get materials and visit, should be fine.</p>

          <p>That's powerful, powerful magic, but I see you've collected what's necessary to make the scroll.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although I can also help you, the Celestine you're looking for was my maternal grandmother, who died early in the first years of the Elyos-Asmodian war. I was born soon after, and mother gave me her name.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The method of making the scroll has been handed down through my family. I can't reveal the process to you, but if you'll wait here, I'll get it ready.</p>

          <p>Yes. With this, you can create the Magic Ward of Coldness. I know it's a funny name, but it's from before the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To combat Fregion's Flame, you'll need to get close. Really close. At the base of the flame there's a small fire core. That's where you must use the scroll.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is of no use in any other place, and I'd hate for your efforts to be wasted.</p>

          <p>Daarunerk found a book describing a possible way to extinguish Fregion's Flame, a process requiring the Magic Ward of Coldness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowledge of how to make the scroll was rumored to rest with a Daeva called Celestine, descendant of the one described in the book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The materials necessary were found in Asmodae, of all places. Celestine warned you the scroll would only work in a certain area, but even with her instructions, the ward was of no use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You reported the result to Atropos, who lamented that the task might be beyond the Elyos entirely.</p>
