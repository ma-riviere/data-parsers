          <p>Here I was feeling frustrated by this guard duty, but what was Terentius doing? Making useless armor!</p>

          <p>The shade-blasted fool used Clodworm leather to construct some so-called armor. He might as well go starkers!</p>

          <p>Basilisk Leather is a hundred times better than Clodworm Leather. Tan it properly and no half-decent sword can cut through it.</p>
