          <p>No, Uncle Belbua.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He sent a letter to my father nearly a month ago saying he would be visiting the citadel in a few days. It's just a short walk and he's heard nothing since the letter.</p>

          <p>No, he would have said something--sent another letter.</p>

          <p>Something must have happened on the road....</p>

          <p>[%username], I hate to ask right after you took the time to deliver this letter--our family has asked enough of you already--but do you think you could check on my uncle? If something did happen to him, I probably wouldn't survive looking for him. I'm not much of a fighter, but a Daeva...</p>

          <p>To get to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA24], you just need to walk back in the direction of the Verteron Citadel. His place is on the outskirts of the Northern Tolbas Forest--you can't miss it.</p>
