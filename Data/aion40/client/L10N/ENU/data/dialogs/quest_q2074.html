          <p>A long time ago, I received a letter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was from one of my friends, and your name was written on it, [%username]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The letter said that you would someday come to Reshanta. And on that day, I was supposed to reveal myself and send you to the letter's author.</p>

          <p>The Leibos manage the Artifact of the Inception, which lets you see and influence the distant future.</p>
