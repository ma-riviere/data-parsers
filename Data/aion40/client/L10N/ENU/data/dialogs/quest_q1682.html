          <p>I'm so angy! Why does Kalione come and go so often?</p>

          <p>I have to guard her every time she goes out to research. It's frustrating.</p>

          <p>You want to help? Yes, please!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suffer from insomnia because of her. But I've heard drinking tea made of dried [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_herb_n_c_40a] might help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never have time to tather Griffonia because I have to chase Kalione all the time. Would you collect some for me?</p>

          <p>I thought [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_herb_n_c_40a] only grew around the Patema Ruins or Stenon Bay, but I've just found out that it grows here, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your best bet is to search around the Observation Post for it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I might use it long term if it works, so please get me a good amount.</p>

          <p>Hmm, this Griffonia smells refreshing. I feel better already.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Drying it for tea may take some time. I'll make juice out of it for now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may be a bit bitter, but if I can get a good night's sleep, I don't care. Thank you for your help.</p>
