          <p>What do you want?! I've been waiting here for some news of my sister, but it has been so long the worry is making me a bit crazy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My other sisters say I should stop looking for her, that Ntuamu is probably dead, but I think she's still alive somewhere. We Seiren are strong!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if she is dead...I must find out for sure.</p>

          <p>A letter for me? Let me see.... Oh...this is definitely Ntuamu's handwriting, but the writing is so blurred I can't read it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, Ntuamu! I must find out what this letter says. It's the only clue I have!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva, would you do me a great kindness? I've heard there's a scholar, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gunter], who restores damaged books. I can't leave home--I want to be here should Ntuamu return. Would you find Gunter for me? Perhaps he can restore this letter.</p>

          <p>Yes, Daeva, many people ask me to restore documents. Old books that have deteriorated or papers that have been left to gather mold or rot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Restoration is a truly rewarding job because it brings back lost memories.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The ink has been blurred, but the paper is intact so I think I can restore it. Let me just brush some of this restoration agent on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See how the blurred ink fades away, revealing the latent ink still remaining from the original script? There...the letter is perfectly legible now.</p>
