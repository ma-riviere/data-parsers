          <p>...no, however you view it, Ladacus should have controlled his temper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, there was...an incident. Our Legion was reinforcing Siel's Western Fortress. We were chasing down a scouting party near the bind point, and a full Asmodian Legion showed up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Centurion realized the scouts had lured us out of the fortress so their troops could cut us off. So he ordered us to abandon the bind point and retreat into the fortress.</p>

          <p>Well, the Asmodians didn't want us retreating. They taunted us, called us cowards, said things about Lady Ariel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're veterans. We ignored them and fell back in good order. But [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Labdacus] was like a mad zaif, tearing through their ranks, cutting through them....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's an amazing warrior. He left a swath of dead behind him, but against a Legion even he had to retreat.</p>

          <p>The Centurion said if others had followed Ladacus, he could have jeopardized the whole Legion. The governor had Ladacus transformed into an Unfest as punishment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's pretty harsh, but it wasn't the first time Ladacus had ignored orders. So now he's exiled to Shade Island, near Siel's Right Wing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to do something for him, but I can't leave. Will you help?</p>

          <p>I just hope he's learned something. If he could control his temper, he'd make a matchless warrior.</p>

          <p>When you delivered it, Ladacus blessed his colleagues for their faithfulness and asked you to inform the governor of his contrition.</p>
