          <p>Hello [%username]. I feel a little bad asking you to do this, because it's a personal request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I made another trip into [%dic:STR_DIC_E_D_LF2a_entrance] and was chased out by [%dic:STR_DIC_E_D_LF2a_Q4119]. It gives me the shakes just thinking about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On your next trip into the labs, I would like you to kill it. I don't have anything to reward you, but if you report your kill to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Surt], he will have something for you.</p>

          <p>I'm glad that Parqusha is in charge of researching Theobomos Lab. He even keeps up on his paperwork!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But lately, every report mentions how [%dic:STR_DIC_E_D_LF2a_Q4119] must be eliminated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That creature has him seriously frightened.</p>

          <p>Parqusha will feel so much better now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll feel better too, because I won't have to read that name in any more of his reports.</p>

          <p>Thank you Daeva.</p>

          <p>Parqusha asked you to kill Naughty Pocaching, which terrified him.</p>

          <p>You entered Theobomos Lab, killed Naughty Pocaching, and reported it to Surt. He told you that Parqusha would be much happier now.</p>
