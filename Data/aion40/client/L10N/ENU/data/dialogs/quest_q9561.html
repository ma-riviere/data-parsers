          <p>Azphelumbra, I'm Belenus, Bothen's wife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He'll spend all of Daeva's Day with his head in an oven, so it's my job to make Daeva's Day gifts. This year, I made pointy hats and firecrackers...a little something to brighten up Pandaemonium. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I obtained a list of Daevas from the Great Temple and mailed a Gift Coupon to everyone. That was more work than I thought...there are a lot of you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Give me the coupon I sent you and I'll give you the Daeva's Day gift.</p>

          <p>Don't tell me you lost it...not after all the effort it took to mail each one!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you find it, come back and you'll get your gift. Until then...Happy Daeva's Day!</p>

          <p>The firecrackers, though...I can't resist setting them off right away!</p>
