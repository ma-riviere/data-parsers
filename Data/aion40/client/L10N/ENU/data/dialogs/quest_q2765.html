          <p>Do you dream, [%username]? I do. I dream. I have a nightmare that never seems to go away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see spirits encircling me, their howls and their shrieks chilling me faster than the coldest of Asmodae's evenings. They turn to come for me, and just as I'm about to be attacked, I wake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's...terrifying.</p>

          <p>Why? Because of the work I do with Grabakr, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm his escort, so wherever he goes, I go. His interest in geology takes us all over Reshanta, to places near and far, places brimming with vicious creatures that need dispatching.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've fought all kinds of terrible beasts, you know, and have more than enough scars to show for it. I'm still struggling to get over the last worm bite....</p>

          <p>What I'm trying to get at is our next assignment. Grabakr wants us to go to Dryrock and examine ore samples there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is that the area is filled with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_ShadowStalker_34_An]s, the very same abominations that haunt my dreams. I'm no coward, but I'd sooner face a Legion of Ellies than those ghosts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thing is, I can't duck out of this assignment, so I'm asking others to head there before we go and clear the spirits out of the area. No one has agreed to help yet, but I'm still holding out hope. How about you, [%username]?</p>
