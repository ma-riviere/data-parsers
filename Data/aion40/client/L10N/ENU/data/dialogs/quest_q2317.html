          <p>Did you know that the Spriggans and the Spriggles are the most powerful creatures in Patamor Thicket, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They used to stay on the other side of the lake, but lately they have expanded their territory into the Thicket itself.</p>

          <p>How did you know? These creatures are small but ferocious, and they've been multiplying like...well, Spriggans. Soon the entire area will be overrun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fortress is in a state of emergency at the moment, though, so it can't send help right now. The locals have contributed to a fund to reward anyone who will hunt these pests.</p>

          <p>Most commendable. Come back after hunting twenty [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg2_23_An]s and nine [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Sprigg3_25_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be easy to hunt so many, but if you take down a few each time you pass through Patamor Thicket, you'll get there eventually.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck!</p>

          <p>Kellan was worried that there was no help coming from the Fortress to combat the Spriggan problem. </p>

          <p>He also said that he would give the work to any Daevas willing to help. So you hunted 20 Spriggan Gatherers and 9 Spriggle Wardens and received a Bronze Coin as a reward. </p>
