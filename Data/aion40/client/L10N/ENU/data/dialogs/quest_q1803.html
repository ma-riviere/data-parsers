          <p>The best time to attack is when the Asmodians have control--they're much easier to fight than the Balaur. There will be a battle during the Vulnerable State.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must go to the fortress then and wipe out the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_1803_all]--Asmodian Fighters, Asmodian Archers, Asmodian Mages, and Asmodian Priests. It doesn't matter if they are Veterans, Experienced or Novices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring back their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1803a]s, too. Please, hurry! We must get control back as soon as possible!</p>
