          <p>I knew you'd ask that, but...it's something that [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF2a_ArchonGuard_2] personally requested. and she swore me to secrecy about it.</p>

          <p>She ordered it from Pandaemonium a long time ago, and it finally arrived yesterday by post. Please tell Parica that I'm sorry for the delay.</p>
