          <p>Yup! It just came to me. Anyway, onto the task at hand. I want you to get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_DrakanFi_27_Ah]. He's inside a fortress under pretty heavy guard, so you'll need to destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_Door_Dr] to get at him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't let a little thing like that come between you and your goal, would you?</p>

          <p>Great! Now, here's a tip to make your life a bit easier. There's an Artifact inside the training camp, which gives some pretty good bonuses. You just need to get past the Nochsana Protector and activate it, then you'll get all its benefits!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet they think they're safe behind the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_Door_Dr], but if you give it a few whacks with this siege weapon, the joke'll be on them! After that, it's just the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Mini_Castle_DrakanFi_27_Ah] and you're done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_LF2_Rogun] for a quick trip to the training camp, once you're ready.</p>

          <p>That's what I like to hear! I haven't been this tickled since I pulled that prank on Rogan here, with the Abex and the fruit cake. Don't give me that look, Rogan. You thought it was funny, too.</p>
