          <p>I'll believe it when I see it. I managed to get the grain I need to feed the guards, but now I'm running out of firewood.</p>

          <p>But there are ways to get fire without wood...the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spectre_41_An]s of the Patema Ruins have [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_1591a]s that burn with a ghostly flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They never go out, but are they hot enough to cook food with? Get me some, and we'll test it out.</p>
