          <p>Ah, [%username]. It's good to see you. I've been thinking about Brusthonin's fate, and it occurs to me that I may have a job for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brusthonin was beautiful once, did you know that? This village is a window to the past in that respect. But then, well...the contagion changed everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It spread slowly, house by house--through food, contact.... We still don't know all the methods. One case led to another within families and soon everyone was dying and then rising again as undead.</p>

          <p>I'm getting to that--patience, please. Once the settlers realized what was happening, they tried to get to safety. Survivors from across Brusthonin fled to Adma Stronghold in hopes of finding shelter. Their hopes were dashed as soon as they arrived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lannok, Lord of Adma Stronghold, was only concerned with his own survival. He abandoned his duty as a Daeva and locked the gate, refusing entry to anyone. Humans starved and died just outside his walls, still calling out for mercy, but Lannok never relented.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one knows whether the contamination made it beyond Adma's gates. The great gate is still locked and nothing I've ever tried would open it.</p>

          <p>There are also the strangest reports...well, little more than rumors, actually. There's word of a child wandering the Stronghold. Orphan or tall tale, we can't risk not investigating. Azphel's shade, that's no place for a child.</p>

          <p>Surt asked you to find a way in and discover the fate of the child. He sent you to speak with Neligor, a nearby Elim, to see if he knew of another way inside. Neligor knew nothing of it but thought the BuBu Skurv might. They were also unable to help, but pointed you toward Cayron, a Brohum who was still friendly to Humans.</p>

          <p>The Brohum was able to tell you of a secret passage between Old Nahor Castle and Adma Stronghold. With the information he gave you, you found the key and then reported back to Surt. He was pleased with your progress and thanked you for your help.</p>
