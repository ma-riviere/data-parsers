          <p>None of us remember what killed us. Actually, I didn't realize for decades that I was dead.</p>

          <p>Indeed. And while I still have my faculties, most of the others don't. They've forgotten who they are.</p>

          <p>There is nothing left in them but obsession with the city and the lighthouse. They attack whatever and whoever approaches.</p>
