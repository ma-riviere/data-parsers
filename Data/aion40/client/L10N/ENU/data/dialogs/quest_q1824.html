          <p>I have too many things to take care of, and now even the weapons give me trouble.</p>

          <p>The problem seems to be that Miren Island is too hot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some swords and bows get bent when exposed too long to heat.</p>

          <p>According to Moirai, the heart of a Ravenous Pretor contains an extract that can be used to make weapons highly resistant to fire. He said I could prevent further bending by applying this to our weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately, there are a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_Pretor_38_An]s on this island. But, of course, I need someone to do the legwork.</p>

          <p>This is amazing. I thought they would be hot because they're resistant to fire, but instead they're cold as ice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I better get busy. Extracting the compounds from the hearts takes time, and I want it to be done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, wait a moment! There may not be enough to coat all the weapons if we get some new recruits. If you get more hearts, please bring them to me as well.</p>

          <p>Taigeta was worried that weapons might be deformed by the heat of Miren Isle and fail in battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was fortunate that Moirai knew the solution: an extract from the hearts of Ravenous Pretors can be used to make weapons resistant to fire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Following Taigeta's instructions, you defeated Ravenous Pretors and took their hearts to her. Afraid that the hearts you brought her would not be enough, she asked you to bring her any Ravenous Pretor hearts you may find.</p>
