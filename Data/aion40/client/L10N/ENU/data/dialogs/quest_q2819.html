          <p>This? It's a master list of all war materiel we're requisitioning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And a big fortress requires a long list. Miss one thing, and--you never know--that one thing could turn the tide of battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know what would shorten my list, though...? A [%userclass] like yourself could bypass the whole requisition process and get certain items directly.</p>

          <p>The Rangers in the fortress have been asking for sulfur to spread on their arrowheads. It makes them burst into flame. Aah, the arrows, not the Rangers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And finding it...well, this is the Sulfur Archipelago, after all. You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_AgrintB_29_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1141_RottenTreeB_29_An] here. They will be perfect for this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Extract their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2819a]. It catches fire easily--just the thing to smear on an arrowhead.</p>

          <p>Gudharten prefers to acquire war supplies locally than requisition them. Sulfur Sap, for example, can be gathered on the spot, and it's useful to the Rangers guarding the fortress.</p>
