          <p>They think my [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_POTION_HP_MP_40A]s are better suited to the monsters and fiends on Atreia! It took me forever to make them, and now they're gone!</p>

          <p>Well, at least there is still some semblance of charity left in this world, hmm?</p>

          <p>I've got others helping recover the goodies. If you could bring back...say...ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_POTION_HP_MP_40A]s? Yes, that should give me enough to time to fix you some kind of reward.</p>

          <p>If you happen to dream up any anti-Shulack technology on your journeys, do let me know. I'll pay top Kinah.</p>

          <p>I asked for ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_POTION_HP_MP_40A]s, remember? I'm not entirely sure what this is, but it's definitely not what I asked for!</p>
