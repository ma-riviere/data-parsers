          <p>Daeva shares a secret with Kuenunerk now. Knows why he is here in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugos cannot simply fly here to there like Daeva, but Kuenunerk is very happy to be here anyway.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See now how valuable Kuenunerk's treasures are, don't you? Much value in information received, yes?</p>

          <p>What? Daeva thinks Kuenunerk didn't trade fairly? Reputation will be damaged with words like that, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shamed Shugo will make amends. Here is a treasure for you to sell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kuenunerk will tell the name of good buyer. Daeva can make this sale instead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, thank you. Kuenunerk will miss the profit from this sale, but better to make [%username] happy than wear the stigma of a swindler.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to sell the seal, go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_13]. She is a dealer in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF2_SUB_C2] of Morheim. But very important--only does business at night. Insomniac, you know, nyerk.</p>

          <p>Crafty, but not so much as clever Choirinererk. Daeva should complete the trade, and collect for real, yes?</p>

          <p>This seal is from the Ruins of Roah? In my research, I learned the ancient city of Roah used some special materials in their seals. From the look of it, I was right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That crafty Shugo, Choirinererk claimed she could get me one, but I was doubtful. I mean, how would a Shugo in Morheim get to and from Reshanta?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I ordered one anyway, just in case. Thank you for delivering it to me, [%username]! </p>
