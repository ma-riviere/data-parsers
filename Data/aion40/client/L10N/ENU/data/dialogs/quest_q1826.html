          <p>It would seem I also need the cores of two other Defenders--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_LightGuardian_50_An]s and  [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1011_DarkGuardian_50_An]s.</p>

          <p>I'm so very sorry, but this needs to be done. I'll reward you handsomely for your trouble.</p>

          <p>When you've defeated the Light's Defender, wait where he appeared until night falls. Be patient, and you will see the Shadow's Defender.</p>
