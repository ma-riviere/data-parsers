          <p>What is Daeva talking about? Akakakak, you think Guruminerk is sad at Gestanerk's death. No, no, once Shugo Vengeance ceremony is complete, Shugos move on to next transaction.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guruminerk worries about Kerubar. Gestanerk was Kerubar whisperer, yes? Always could control monsters, make gathering easier.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now must ask if helpful Daeva can get rid of rampaging Kerubar instead?</p>

          <p>Akakakak, excellent work. Some say Daevas are only interested in Truth and Justice, but Guruminerk can see at least one who knows what is important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now excavations can proceed without dust, and glossy sheen will not fade!</p>
