          <p>Oh [%username], I miss quiet Alsig Village and my family there. I'm so lonely!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>None of the Daevas here respect a Dado farmer like myself. Do they turn their noses up at you for your...um...early days? No?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Back home we'd be harvesting the first of the fruit for our wine. In the evenings, we'd sit around drinking and telling stories. Don't you miss your home, Daeva?</p>

          <p>Well, the truth is, I never wanted to be a Daeva. I wanted a simple life living with my sweet wife and working a Dado field we could call our own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know why I was chosen to become a Daeva, or how I ended up here fighting alongside these cold-hearted soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just want to quit everything and go back to my village. Oh, if only I had some of the Alsig Special Wine.... It would relieve my homesickness for a while. [%username], would you help me get some?</p>
