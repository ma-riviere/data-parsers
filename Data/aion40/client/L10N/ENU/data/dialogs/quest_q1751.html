          <p>As if your infant brain could understand. But if you promise not to bother me anymore, I will explain. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Reshanta is strong in fire energy. So much so that the creatures living here have developed along strange lines.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've never seen their like in Elysea. So I study them, collecting samples. It's delicate and highly specialized work.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But it amuses me to watch you try. If you can, go get samples from the Sulfur Oculazen and Lava Hoverstone.</p>
