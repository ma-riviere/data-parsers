          <p>I know why you're here, [%username]. I've heard the stories about all the candy everywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, it was the stuff I made. Yes, the Shulacks stole it. No, I'm not happy. Yes, I would like some beer. No, I'm not going to pay you for it. Yes, I am sorry. No, I don't want you to beat me up.</p>

          <p>Oh, nothing. I'm just...fed up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shulacks have turned socialist, or something. Stole the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_POTION_HP_MP_40A]s I'd made for everyone, and started handing them out to the blasted monsters outside! Monsters! Eating candy!</p>
          <p> </p>
 	  			<p>Anyway, I need them back. Harvest Revel is underway, and the Pumpkin King has to have his pumpkin treats to dish out. Maybe...maybe you could pick them up?</p>

          <p>I need you collect ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_POTION_HP_MP_40A]s. They should be easy enough to see, and I doubt the monsters actually bothered trying to eat them.</p>
