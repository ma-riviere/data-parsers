          <p>There's something rotten in Eltnen, I fear, something scaly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yesterday, near Kuriullu Mountain, I came across some people. They were Lepharist Revolutionaries, so I hid 'til they passed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But among the Lepharists were...others.</p>

          <p>No! Greenish monsters, with a fish's head. I've seen my share of creatures, but nothing like these. They called them 'Pretor,' but.... </p>
          <p> </p>
