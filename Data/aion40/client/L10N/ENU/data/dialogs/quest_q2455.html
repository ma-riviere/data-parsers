          <p>Sometimes it does. As activity has increased, it's become more difficult to operate the Obelisk. I know it looks easy, but really it requires a great deal of concentration to operate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's exhausting, too. I could really use a drink. You don't happen to have any [%dic:STR_DIC_E_berry_d_n_c_20a]s do you?</p>
