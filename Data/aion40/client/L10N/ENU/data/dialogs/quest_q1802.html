          <p>Losing Siel's Eastern Fortress to the enemy was an unfortunate humiliation for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If those fools of the Nezekan's Shield were a little smarter, it would never have happened, but there's no use pointing fingers now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now all that matters is that we retake the fortress.</p>
