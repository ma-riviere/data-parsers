		<p>Did you know that bronze coins symbolize luck? Few follow the custom anymore, but soldiers used to put a few bronze coins in their Cube before each battle.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>You must have had a little luck yourself, if you've got bronze coins to turn in.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>The more coins, the better the reward. And my rewards are useful only if you're a Gladiator, Templar, Ranger, or Assassin. </p>

		<p>As I said, bronze coins are lucky. So it's only fitting that I give you whatever reward I grab first, eh?</p>

		<p>If you're truly lucky, this will be the perfect item for you. If not, well...better luck next time, I suppose.</p>

		<p>If you want the reward, come back after you have either three or six bronze coins from missions you've completed.</p>
