          <p>When you see an Archon like myself, would you ever guess I was an abandoned child? The first sound I can remember is the cry of the Daru in the Moslan Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The hunters found me wrapped in a blanket and brought me to the village. Some whispered I was the child of a forest spirit, but the priest put a stop to that. He raised me as his own, and I never really worried about my real parents. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sorry...am I boring you?</p>

          <p>Thank you. When I ascended, the priest gave me two gifts--a blanket and a necklace.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The blanket was the one I was found in,  the necklace was bundled inside. It's so amazing, so valuable...why would people who could afford such jewelry abandon a child?</p> 
          <p> </p>	
          <p>I just can't get it out of my mind. I need to know how I got here.</p>

          <p>I've thought about looking for my parents many times, but could never summon the courage to do it. As a Daeva, I may live forever. They were probably just Humans....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only clue I have is this necklace. It's a beautiful thing, a rare piece of work. If I can trace who made it, I may find the original owner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot leave my post, but you...you can travel freely. [%username], it's a lot to ask, but could you please take this necklace and discover the identity of my parents?</p>

          <p>Of course. The high priest Balder commissioned it as a gift for his only daughter, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Annemari], to mark her ascension.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Balder was very specific on what he wanted. I remember how Master Wilvar suffered over the details...he took such pains.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no question that this is the same piece--no one else could even come close. The central jewel is of unmatched size and luster. Yes, quite unique...</p>

          <p>It clearly means a lot to him, however, so perhaps he should keep it. What's more, the necklace and this box were originally a pair--they belong together. He should treasure them, even if they cannot help him find his parents.</p>

          <p>Annemari acknowledged that the necklace was hers, but told you she had never given birth to a child. She gave you a jewel box that once went with the necklace, asking you to give them both back to Arekedil.</p>
