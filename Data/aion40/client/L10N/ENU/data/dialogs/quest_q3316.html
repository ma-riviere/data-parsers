          <p>The Acheron Drake Horns you brought...they're imbued with unique powers. Powers we can use in our research!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this point, we're fairly sure that the Sataloca's Vicious Mind is responding to a magical signal that resonates with the horns. But the signal comes in short bursts that're difficult to pin down.</p>

          <p>We could use your help again, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As before, we'd like you to hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Bonedrake_26_An]s and bring back [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1333a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is that we don't know how many horns we'll need to home in on the correct signal frequency. Maybe three?</p>

          <p>Just FYI--the last time I was picnicking down by Sataloca's Tomb, I saw lots of Acheron Drakes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? It's a lovely place for a picnic.</p>

          <p>No! How can you block my research this way? This research is for the good of all Atreia and Lord Kimeia!</p>

          <p>I saw some of your hunt. Your skills have progressed considerably since last we met.</p>

          <p>It's not about the hunt you know, it's about obtaining the required supplies for the experiments. Without them, we're stuck.</p>

          <p>Now, go acquire the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1333a]s for me, but...try not to look so gleeful!</p>

          <p>Radamanthys said he needed more horns to study magical resonance in the Acheron Drakes created by Sataloca's Heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You toasted the Acheron Drakes and collected their horns. Radamanthys thanked you and asked you to help again if necessary.</p>
