          <p>No, we must do more. Can't just top and tail the Training Camp...we need to gut the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm talking about the instructors, [%username]. They're smart enough to carry on without their General. They know what they're doing, and won't stop just because their recruits are lying dead at their feet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'll recruit more. There are always more Balaur.</p>

          <p>The instructors are stationed near the artifact, the fortress gate, and near their bind points.
