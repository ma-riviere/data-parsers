          <p>Throughout my hundred-year career as governor of Reshanta, I've listened to Asmodians gripe about what they call "Qooqoo tasks."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those tasks, like everything we do in the Abyss, have a purpose, and that purpose is alertness. Alertness must be ingrained into every Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Better to lose your wings than to lose your powers of observation.</p>

          <p>In the Abyss, you must remain alert at all times if you expect to stay alive. Awareness, or the lack of it, can turn the tides of war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are four legions of Daeva somewhere in the Wings of Siel, all dead because one Daeva fell asleep on the job. Luckily they're Ellie legions--we caught the idiot asleep before they did.</p>
          <p> </p>      
          <p>Today, we need to capture [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q1737all]. Now, we're unlikely to catch the Guardian Generals asleep. I need alert Daevas at the Siel's Eastern Fortress, Siel's Western Fortress, and Sulfur Fortress.</p>

          <p>Good. First, pay attention and know when it's time to recapture the fortress occupied by the enemy. Then, gather alert Daevas into a fighting force to assist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take out the Guardian Generals of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q1737all]. They won't be alone, so keep your eyes open!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Capturing the fortress is one step to our success in the Abyss and victory in this war. My ultimate goal is to drive them out of Reshanta.</p>

          <p>All Daevas in the Abyss are afraid when the fighting starts. If they say otherwise, they're lying to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Real Asmodians fight even when they are afraid. Some get over their fright in a minute of combat. Some in an hour. For some, it takes days. But real Asmodians never let their fear overtake their honor or duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, get over it.</p>

          <p>I took this position not just because I thought Asmodae needed to control the Abyss, but because I knew we could. I knew it would be tough, but I was and am confident in the superiority of Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to Daevas like you, I know we will reign over the Abyss.</p>
