          <p>Ah! I can see a keen intellect behind that glint in your eye. Sharp minds such as ours are priceless in these treacherous times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I am writing a new tome on the traditional beliefs of Kobolds, a sequel to my previous work, "A Study of Krall Religious Rituals." Perhaps you are familiar with it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The slave/master relationship between Krall and Kobold is well documented. The cultures of the two races bear remarkable similarities. Yet when it comes to religion, we see dramatic differences.</p>

          <p>The Krall revere iconic figures such as Saendukal the Dragon Lord. The Kobolds, on the other hand, are tethered to more a rustic system of worship. Their idols are rocks, trees, and even some of the larger animals of our world--the animals they don’t eat, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dukaki tribe of the Verteron region are particularly staunch in their beliefs. They sometimes carry strange wooden amulets, carved in the likenesses of their gods.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>The amulets vary widely in shape and design. I believe rank, profession, and gender all play a part in determining the appearance of an amulet, but I need more examples so I can undertake a complete study.</p>

          <p>I thought you’d never ask! Some Elyos think it strange and even unhealthy to take an interest in these bestial creatures, but knowing one's enemy is the first step to defeating them.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>Ideally, I would conduct all of the research for my book myself, but...well...the problem is Ulaguru. I am the only one who can handle him, you see, and he can’t very well come with me.</p>

          <p>I was right about you! They usually carry their Amulets when they are safe in their own community, such as the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA13] in Verteron. You're unlikely to find them anywhere else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, the Dukaki will protect their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_junk_k_s_13d]s fiercely. You may need to be especially...persuasive, but I’ll leave your methods up to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stick to the task, [%username]. Though your job may be arduous, the scientific cause is of tremendous importance!</p>

          <p>My studies have all but ground to a halt. Without new objects worthy of study, a scholar is isolated--as imprisoned as Ulaguru here.</p>

          <p>Yes, these are the amulets!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you see how they correspond to the Kobold gods? This one here, for instance, it resembles a Brax...and this one, it seems to be some sort of tree. I wonder if...yes, of course! The Kobold religion is...oh my...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Forgive me, [%username]. Where are my manners? It's just that having the amulets here, in my hand...I can finally continue my work. Thank you! You have performed a great service.</p>
