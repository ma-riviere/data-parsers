          <p>You know, the Balaur have to eat too. Yeah, I know many Humans think they only eat the flesh of Asmodian babies, but they march on their stomachs just like us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's a big reason why the Chantra Dredgion is so important. It can get food, potions, and other items anywhere in Balaurea with ease.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we had anything like that to aid our efforts in Elysea, this war would've been over ages ago. Logistics are that important.</p>

          <p>The next time you're aboard the Chantra Dredgion, you should pay more attention to the supplies it carries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's just food and bandages, sure, but you should know by now how precious food and bandages can be when you're in a huge battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, why don't you make it a goal to try to take some and bring them to me? It'll both rob them of supplies and tell us something about how their system works.</p>

          <p>Well, I'm not saying you should try to empty the Dredgion of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDreadgion_02_Drakanbox_Q3723]. That's just impossible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But take as much as you can, and destroy the rest. They should be in the Supply Warehouse, or maybe on some Shulack crew members.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might get caught up in combat, but don't forget those supplies. They're the Dredgion's whole purpose. Remember that.</p>

          <p>I know it's hard to be bothered with a box while you're surrounded by Balaur, but this could be important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, those supplies are key to the Chantra Dredgion's entire mission. I explained how those "mere" boxes are keeping them in this war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand, though. Being aboard a Dredgion in the first place is harrowing. Just...think about what I said, all right?</p>

          <p>You've groused about a lack of support and supplies before, haven't you? How do you think the Balaur will feel when their precious Chantra Dredgion dries up?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet the Balaur keep discipline through fear. Well, frustration and defeat cut through fear pretty easily; I know that first-hand.</p>

          <p>You forgot, didn't you? That entire discussion we had, and you forgot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fine, fine, I won't judge. I've studied the Chantra Dredgion for a long time, but I'll freely admit I've never been aboard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just remember the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDreadgion_02_Drakanbox_Q3723] next time, okay?</p>

          <p>Hmmm.... Potions, scrolls, foodstuffs.... Though those look pretty disgusting, I suppose they must be tasty enough to the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send these to Pandaemonium for study right away. With a little research and luck, we may find out something about their manufacture or effects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work. Hopefully we can count on you to raid the Chantra Dredgion again in the future. Remember: logistics! The key to war!</p>

          <p>Yorgen wanted you to not only destroy Balaur Supplies carried by the Chantra Dredgion, but also to take some for possible study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you brought him some and Yorgen thanked you, saying he'd send them to Pandaemonium for research.</p>
