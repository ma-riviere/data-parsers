          <p>The work of a Protector of Divinity differs from that of a priest, you know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Protector does so much more than praying or gathering temple offerings. There would be no need for a Protector if that was all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Protector of Divinity should support people's belief and help them through the tough times as well.</p>

          <p>It is true. And right now, the people most in need are the refugees in Besfer Village, what with all the undead that have come to occupy the village recently.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would help if I could, of course, but I know nothing of the undead. A Protector of Divinity was dispatched, though. If anyone knows what to do about this situation, she should.</p>

          <p>Well, so far, I've learned that it was Beritra's Weapon that started this epidemic--that turned the villagers into an army of undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I also know that they are, in turn, contaminating the other creatures in the area. It's urgent that we send them all back to the Aether's flow, but my two Archons can't do it by themselves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you are able to help, you should head that way and take care of any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ZombieD_35_An]s that you find.</p>

          <p>Beritra's Weapon is the big problem--and what a problem it is. To get near it is to become undead, which makes neutralizing it challenging, to say the least.</p>
