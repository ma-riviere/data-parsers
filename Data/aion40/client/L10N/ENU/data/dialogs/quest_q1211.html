          <p>Healing souls is exhausting work. Using the Obelisk looks easy, but it takes intense concentration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After healing one or two souls, we become mentally fatigued.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can restore our strength by quiet meditation, but that takes time, which we don't always have. The potion can refresh us immediately, but I'm nearly out.</p>

          <p>Titania explained that operating the Obelisk requires a high level of concentration and that she likes to keep Mana Treatment Potions on hand for emergencies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She usually makes the potions herself from Targena. Since she had to stay by the Obelisk, you collected the herb for her.</p>
