          <p>I was back in Sanctum when I was called up to work here. I was the toast of the town--the other Daevas I ascended with were all assigned guard duty in our capital.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They were so jealous.... If only they knew what life here was really like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're constantly on edge, we have to work long, long shifts, and when our shifts are finally over, we're all too exhausted to do anything other than eat and sleep.</p>

          <p>True. I just wish I had been dealt a better hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's all because of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up_Asteria_SZ_All], you know. The Balaur hold onto it so desperately, even when all the territories around it have fallen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finish them off, would you? Tear their grip from this place, and grant those of us who work here at least a day of respite. I hear there are significant treasures to be plucked, too, so you'd not come back empty-handed.</p>

          <p>Good. Now, to get to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Up_Asteria_SZ_All], you just need to knock on the painting over there. Yes, you heard me right. Knock on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur have set up an elaborate defense network, you see. We found a way to breach their network and create a small portal to their room, and had it placed in the painting's oils.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As soon as you enter, they'll start to hide their treasure, so fight effectively and kill them all. Faith and arms!</p>
