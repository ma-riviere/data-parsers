          <p>Greetings, [%username]. It's been some time since we've crossed paths. How have your days been under this beautiful sun?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you been to Inggison Fortress recently? I ask because there's someone there that's been on my mind. She's a beautiful young Guardian named Mesalina.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know her? Ahhh, the fairest Guardian I have ever laid eyes upon. A true goddess walking amongst us. I cannot stop thinking about her. She...she...</p>

          <p>Special? She is more than just special! She is...simply lovely. I have met many beautiful women in my travels, but never one quite like Mesalina.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sun was shining wonderfully the day we met, and its golden rays made her blonde hair look like sweet honey. Her eyes as blue as Celatu Lake in the summer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ohhh, I am in love with Mesalina, my friend. I have decided it. I woke up early this morn and decided that I must have her in my life.</p>

          <p>Lady of Light, it is love! I know love! I have been in love a thousand times, and this is most certainly love!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She did not really speak with me much when we first met...she was as passive as a summer breeze. Can you believe that? Just look at me, look at my fine hair and strong jaw! And she let me get away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now she is all that I can think about. Ahhh, my sweet Mesalina, my nectar of passion. I hate to ask this of you, but would you take passage to Inggison Fortress and find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mesalina] for me? Tell her of my love for her. Tell her I await her here. I would tell her myself but I just had these shoes polished and the path there is quite filthy.</p>

          <p>And remind her of how handsome I am, will you? Remind her of my fine hair and charming wit. Tell her that I await her presence here...but don't mention anything about not wanting to get my shoes dirty. Just tell her I am very busy with work.</p>

          <p>From what you said, she did seem a little angry that I sent you. But she did invite me out to the fortress to see her, right? That's a good sign.</p>
