          <p>Asmodae is always presented as this hellish place of gloom and misery. Seeing what Asmodians are like, I can certainly imagine it true.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I find myself curious about them and their world sometimes. What are they really like? What do they think of us?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One thing is for sure: they certainly face many similar problems. The Balaur, and Sapiens of course. But then there are also...</p>

          <p>Ah, you heard that too, did you? Yes, the Lepharists are recruiting in Asmodae too. That's definitely a bad sign for us all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand they have a place called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_G4_3]. Elyos Daevas who go there tend to return via an Obelisk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Lepharist named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDF3LP_LehparEleShamanNmdDQ_45_Ae] is one of those in charge. Are you interested in taking on a task for me...?</p>

          <p>I wonder how the Asmodians would react were we to take down one of their key Lepharist figures? Would they be angry? Grateful?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of it as a psychological test. Of course, weakening the Lepharists anywhere helps take a little pressure off us Elyos too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever Asmodae is really like, it's a dangerous place for our kind. You should be prepared long before you even glimpse the Lab.</p>

          <p>You are glaring at me rather strangely. You think because I don't automatically assume the Asmodians to be mindless beasts, I'm some kind of traitor?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One could argue I'm actually helping Elysea. After all, understanding one's foe is a major step in defeating them.</p>

          <p>You're a remarkably closed-minded sort. I didn't think you were the type. Oh, well, I guess I have to learn to hone my judgment of others.</p>

          <p>I've always wanted to go to Asmodae, if only for a little while, just to see the reality of it for myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Failing that, I wanted to go to the Abyss, to "meet" some Asmodians in the flesh. But I was sent here instead. I've not even seen an enemy incursion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I realize that's actually a good thing for me; I doubt the Asmodians share my curiosity. Oh, yes, your mission...?</p>

          <p>You should tell me about your experiences there. Perhaps you have a better understanding of those we call foes now...?</p>

          <p>If nothing else, you dealt a serious blow to the Lepharists, which I'm sure you agree is an objectively good thing. Well done!</p>

          <p>Administration Officer Keas is fascinated by Asmodians. He heard about High Priest Esras, a prominent Lepharist in Asmodae, and suggested you destroy her as a "psychological experiment" on the nature of Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You infiltrated Asmodae, found the Alquimia Research Center, and killed Esras. You returned safely to Keas's gratitude and reward.</p>
