          <p>I believe you will, [%username]. So here's the truth of the matter.... We are not Gergers, but Daevas. And not just Daevas but Daevas of Elysea. We came to Asmodae long ago through a rift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of my companions died fighting the Archons, but we few survived. We changed our form to preserve our lives. Eventually we learned the Asmodian language.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The others no longer want to go home, but I have not endured these trials in vain. I must find a way to return to Elysea.</p>
