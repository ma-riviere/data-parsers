          <p>I've received word of other abberations in the Decayed Grove.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Agrints used to appear every now and then, but nothing like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like Agrints, these are mobile, but their appendages look just like Human hands and feet.</p>

          <p>What was it they said.... Ah! Rotron! They're said to be trees that look like Humans...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It sounds absurd, but I think we'd better check this out. Will you help me, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please go to the Decayed Grove and see if you can find any [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Rottentree_34_An]s.</p>

          <p>I'm grateful for your aid. Please bring back any evidence of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Rottentree_34_An]s' existence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1526a] would be appropriate. We could use that to learn more about these Rotrons.</p>

          <p>I had a Daevic visitor recently who said the Decayed Grove is swarming with Agrints and Rotrons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems the Elim have disappeared completely from the Decayed Grove. It pains my heart.</p>

          <p>Still, what must be done, must be done. Did you bring the rind I asked for?</p>
