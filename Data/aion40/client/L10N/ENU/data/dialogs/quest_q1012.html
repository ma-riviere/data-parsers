          <p>It won't do! These aren't the actions of Elyos warriors. These are the actions of cowards, snivelling, wide-eyed COWARDS! I won't have it!</p>

          <p>Sorry, you're right. I'm angry at myself for dismissing reports of these strangers when I first heard them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The more I heard, the more I denied. I dismissed trustworthy couriers, loyal sentinels. I was a fool.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally I could no longer deny it. I saw one of them, only briefly, but it stayed with me. And I learned their name--the Lepharist Revolutionaries.</p>

          <p>Lepharists. If it is them, we've got a huge problem on our hands. They're subversive and manipulative. They get under people's skins and twist their nerves into knots.</p>
