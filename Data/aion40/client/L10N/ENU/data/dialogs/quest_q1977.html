          <p>Your work has been most impressive. And if it were just up to me, I'd have given you the title of Expert already. But that's not how things are handled on the official level.</p>

          <p>There's one more item you're required to craft before I can give the recommendation.</p>

          <p>Back so far as the Millennium War, Daevas with exceptional skill were crafting tools for the fight against the Balaur. Rare and highly sought after were the Fasimedes' Noble Necklaces. And honors were bestowed upon the Handicrafters who made them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is a rare item that one can't easily craft. Today, we still honor Handicrafters who can. Do you think you can create one?</p>

           <p> </p>
          <p>Buy the design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_c5]. It's a more complicated design than the one for [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1977], but I have a feeling that you're up to the task of crafting Fasimedes' Noble Necklace for me.</p>
