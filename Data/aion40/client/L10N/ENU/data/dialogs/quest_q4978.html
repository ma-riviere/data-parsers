          <p>That [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Ship_Da]! Kidnapping innocent Shugos! They deserve a horrible, horrible fate, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have heard stories from rescued victims. Some of the jobs they were forced to do! Disgusting! Terrible!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But how to get revenge...? Of course! Steal goodies from them! Make them poor and make us richer! Perfect vengeance!</p>

          <p>It definitely is! Akakakak! And I know of perfect target too: Captain Grogget's Safe! Must have so many treasures inside!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only problem is, I hear it is guarded by huge, strong Manduri. I could send thieves to loot safe, but they would not stand chance against that Manduri.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva could take care of it for us, could get treasures out of safe, and cut you in! Deal great blow to Steel Rake at same time! You will do it, yes?</p>

          <p>Yes! This will be good for all Shugo everywhere, not just those who keep safe's treasures! Just you wait and see!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDShip_ManduriGiantNmd_43_Ah] is main obstacle. Just get rid of it, and rest will be smooth sailing...so to speak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Safe, and so Mantutu, is in center of Steel Rake's middle floor. It is no pushover, so be careful!</p>

          <p>Then I will order thieves to attack the safe right now! We will share treasures with Steel Rake kidnap victims, of course.</p>

          <p>Do not be so paranoid, Daeva. Just take reward; it is your share of treasures I know we will find. Very generous, to pay in advance, yes?</p>

          <p>Payrinrinerk wanted revenge on the Steel Rake, which kidnaps innocent Shugos and puts them to work. She decided to do so by raiding the captain's safe.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>She sent you to kill Golden Eye Mantutu, the giant Manduri guardian of the safe, so she could send hired thieves to steal treasure in the name of innocent Shugos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Mantutu and returned to Payrinrinerk, who was gleeful at the thought of what her thieves could steal from the Shulacks.</p>
