          <p>I'm sure you understand by now how important our presence here is. We fight to completely secure Gelkmaros for Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our ultimate goal, of course, is to use Gelkmaros as a springboard into Tiamaranta, so that we may destroy Dragon Lord Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, there are many obstacles in our path. One of the most persistent is the Chantra Dredgion.</p>

          <p>Yes. This particular Dredgion is a supplies and troop transporter, constantly refreshing the Balaur with provisions and reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our resources, of course, are in much shorter supply. We are still in enemy territory, after all. The Balaur are only reeling, not defeated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Balaur were in the same boat as us, we could gain the upper hand. The Chantra Dredgion must be dealt with, and you are the Daeva to do it.</p>

          <p>I must say that I didn't expect you to refuse such an important mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or do you refuse BECAUSE you realize how important it is?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that would be unworthy of you. I do appreciate your candor; this task deserves nothing less. Please leave me. There is much I must do.</p>

          <p>You must be [%username]. Brigade General Valetta told me to expect you. Pay attention, because I'm only going to brief you once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've ever been aboard the Dredgion in Reshanta, the basic structure of the Chantra Dredgion is the same, so that won't be a problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your goal there, however, is different. We don't care about how well the Dredgion runs. We're concerned about the supplies and troops it carries, and whether any of it is usable.</p>

          <p>First, steal [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDDreadgion_02_Drakanbox_Q3721] from the armory. This'll reduce the number of battle-ready troops in Gelkmaros.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then you must kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDDreadgion_02_DrakanBoss_55_Ah]. He not only commands the Chantra Dredgion, but he's also a master strategist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's known to be as fearsome directing a battle as he is actually fighting one. They say Tiamat doesn't make a move without his approval, and that everything the Balaur do here and in Inggison has been worked out by him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see where I'm going with this. His death would be a serious blow to Balaur efforts here. He has to die.</p>

          <p>Tiamat's forces will be scrambling for weapons and leadership now. This is the perfect time to strike back.</p>

          <p>Valetta's campaigns are being hampered by the Chantra Dredgion, which keeps Balaur forces refreshed with provisions and reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To halt its influence, you boarded it, stole from its weapons supplies, and killed its captain, a master strategist. Valetta was very pleased at your success.</p>
