          <p>Our residents go out less and less often these days.</p>

          <p>Well, the creatures, of course. They're all over the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_2].</p>

          <p>They just give people the creeps. That's the one creature I hear our residents complaining about the most often.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I try to get to them when I can, but I've got so much work to do around the fortress itself. Could you take care of some [%dic:STR_DIC_M_lepismaD_10_n]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would really help the residents feel safe enough to go outside again.</p>
