          <p>Kidorun Grave Robber Band have had hard times before, Daeva. But this is worst, yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We make Kinah, scratch a living, nyerk. But here, only Malek, and Malek reserves are controlled by Lepharists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can't get close, can't get Malek, can't get Kinah, can't get food. Nyerk, nyerk....</p>

          <p>Yes yes, Malek there, but small, and full of Drakies and Drakes that scare us away!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah! Plan! Daeva could kill Drakes and Drakies, yes? Then we could mine all day and all night, yes? Yes yes! Akak!</p>

          <p>Daeva might think Drakies should be left alone, yes? But even if they leave Humans and Daevas alone, they still snap and claw at Shugos! Might look so so cute to you, Daeva, but from down here, so so scary!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get rid of them, and bring Huarinrinerk their scales, yes? I'll make sure to give big reward!</p>

          <p>Huarinrinerk, a member of Kidorun Grave Robber Band, came to Beluslan to mine Malek. However, the Lepharists were occupying the main mine, and Drakes and Drakies were preventing her mining elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Huarinrinerk thought that hunting Malek Drakies and Drakes would mean the Kidorun Grave Robber Band would open up areas for mining. You agreed, and hunted the creatures for her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon your return you presented Huarinrinerk with the Violet Scales and Light Violet Scales to prove your work, and received your reward.</p>
