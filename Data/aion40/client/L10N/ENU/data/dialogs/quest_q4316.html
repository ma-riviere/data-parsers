          <p>We Asmodians are accustomed to loss. But I still find the ravages of this war overwhelming at times.</p>

          <p>Our legacy has been tarnished and shattered by our enemies and, at times, our own carelessness. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_UNdeadLight_all]s might be just ghosts now, but they help us to preserve our own past.</p>

          <p>I had a chance to examine the relics you brought, and I discovered a powerful one which almost fell into the hands of those sun-blighted Elyos.</p>

          <p>I hear reports all the time of new relics being discovered. How about retriving another? You've done this before--it shouldn't be too difficult.</p>

          <p>Here, [%username], have a look at this pattern. Unique, isn't it? No two relics are the same--each tells a different tale. Archaeology is fun, but it's also an important part of understanding our heritage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.</p>
