          <p>The war has been raging in Reshanta for more than seven hundred years. Even for a Daeva, that's a long time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To gain an edge and turn the tide of war, Asmodae needs a hero to rally behind. A hundred and twenty years ago, before I took this position as governor, I was that hero.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, now...now, I cannot.</p>
