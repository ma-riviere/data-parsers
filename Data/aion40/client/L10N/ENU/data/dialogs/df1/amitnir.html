          <p>Tell me, Great One, do you really think that ascension happens only through the will of the Shedim Lords?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Call me a skeptic. Everything a clever mind can't rationalize gets explained away as "the will of the Shedim Lords?"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, we'll figure out the secret to ascension. Then any Human who wants to ascend can do so. And I'll be one of the first Daevas to ascend of their own free will.</p>
