          <p>Gribade is my healing place. As I walk and gather mushrooms, my mind clears. The work eases my pain, and I can reflect on the happy times, before I lost my wife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aaah, you didn't know.... My wife was killed here a year ago by some animal our trackers didn't recognize. Every day I ask the Five Empyrean Lords what I could have done to deserve that kind of suffering....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The pain has eased, but I will never forget. I hope to search out whatever killed her.</p>
