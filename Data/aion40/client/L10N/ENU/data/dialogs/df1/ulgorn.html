          <p>While you're here...have you seen my daughter, Rae? I'm so worried that I almost forget to flog the laggards.</p>

          <P> </P>
          <P>Over my dead body, I told her! The sooner I can get her out of Ishalgen and back to civilization, the better. If you see her, make sure she's up to no mischief.</P>
