          <p>I was running an errand...taking a cube to a nearby village. A pack of thieves ambushed me and told me to hand over the cube.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I remember thinking, "This is it...I'm going to die," but I fought tooth and nail to protect the cube. At least I wasn't going to die easy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was losing the fight, but then I felt...different. My back started to sting--my wings were sprouting, you see. And on that day, I flew for the first time.</p>
