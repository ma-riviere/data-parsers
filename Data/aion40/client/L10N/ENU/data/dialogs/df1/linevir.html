          <p>Hm...not a simple question to answer, I'm afraid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Obelisks are actually Aetheric Stone which is created when Aether is trapped within a finite space for centuries. The stone forms around the Aether, and it grows with each passing year. When it reaches this size, we can harness its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soul Healing means that the Obelisk takes an imprint of your soul and brings you back from the brink of death. It also serves as a teleportation point if you're bound to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each Obelisk is a natural wonder--a gift from Aion. You would do well to respect its power.</p>

          <p>Binding lets the Obelisk protect you when you are on the brink of death. You can't die from a war wound, but every time the Obelisk saves you, your soul diminishes a bit in the process.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of it as a last resort should you ever take on more than you can handle.</p>

          <p>The Obelisk saves your physical body, but your soul is weakened in the process. Your limbs are slower, your body is weaker, and some of your combat experience is forgotten--all temporarily, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Every time you are summoned back by the Obelisk, your soul diminishes a little more, and you feel the weakness longer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But fear not! These injuries to the soul are the very ones I can heal.</p>

          <p>Aha! Such curiosity! The healing process works like this:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I channel energy from the Obelisk, bind it with naturally occurring Aetheric energy, and purge your soul of any injuries.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The entire process is painless, though it requires a great deal of skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, my prices reflect the difficulty of the task at hand.</p>
