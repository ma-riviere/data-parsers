          <p>I joined the raiders to make my fortune and help all of Asmodae. But things don't always work out how you'd like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take me. I came here for the money, but found my conscience in my way. I have to "deal" with the Karnifs, but I find myself sympathizing with them a little. Such fierce creatures!</p>

        <p>Most importantly, is it worth fighting for?</p>
