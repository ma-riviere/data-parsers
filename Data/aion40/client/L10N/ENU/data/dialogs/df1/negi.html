          <p>Believe it or not, fishing used to be a real passion for me. Now it's becoming a chore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I used to come out to the lakes and spend hours fishing. It was so relaxing. Now I have these heavy quotas to meet and I just stand here all day long.</p>

          <p>Oh it's you! Ulgorn said one of us had ascended!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That brought a good chuckle, let me tell you! One day a raider, stealing grain from the Mau, and the next, a Daeva!</p>
