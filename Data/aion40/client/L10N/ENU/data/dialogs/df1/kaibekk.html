          <p>Well, it may sound kind of funny...but I'd call him my companion in arms.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>See, I tracked him and tried to take his hide....his fur would have fetched a pretty stack of Kinah. We fought for hours, and no winner! But we know one another's strength now.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>And since then, we always hunt together.</P>
