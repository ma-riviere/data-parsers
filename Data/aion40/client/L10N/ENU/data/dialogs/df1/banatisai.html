          <p>You know, when Brigade General Suthran sent me to Impetusium, I was so excited! With all the Aether here, I figured I'd spend all day flying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm not assigned to air patrol. I'm so busy with reconstruction that I hardly have time to spread my wings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Grak and Gulkalla stay up there on the upper side of the building, so they don't have to deal with the spirits. I have to fight off the spirits and keep the laborers from fleeing.</p>

          <p>They think we're their enemies! Do I look like an Elyos to you?</p>

          <p>I complain to Gulkalla, but he doesn't have any rank either, so he's hardly going to be able to request reinforcements.</p>
