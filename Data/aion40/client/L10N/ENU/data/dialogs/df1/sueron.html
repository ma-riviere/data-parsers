          <p>As commander of this fortress, I have neither the time nor the inclination to engage in "chat" or "light banter" with Daevas who should be facing the many threats to our success here in Altgard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Believe me, [%userclass], if I had orders for you, you'd already be out there carrying them out with all the strength and valor befitting Asmodae's protectors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I have a hard time believing that you're spending your time wisely right now. And I'm absolutely certain you're wasting my time.</p>
