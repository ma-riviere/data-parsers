          <p>Some say that Human activity is making summers hotter, but I don't believe it, personally. I think it's a plot to make Asmodae weaker.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe some Human/Mosbear/Porgus hybrid is responsible! It's just as likely, don't you think? That reminds me, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Elma] in Pandaemonium is accepting Scorching Heat. I hear you get interesting rewards in return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just remember: don't believe the scholars. There's no consensus among them anyway!</p>
