          <p>One of the first things you learn in the Abyss is caution. Fighting Asmodae's enemies is all well and good, but to continue to fight, you need to survive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Battling a foe that you cannot defeat does no one any good. It is a distraction to your fellows, which may prove to be fatal to them as well as you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The newly ascended especially need that lesson. If I had a Kinah for every one that needed Soul Healing because of recklessness...</p>

          <p>Very. Lately, I've been keeping track of the movements of Brigadier Indratu. Yes, I'm far from the Abyss, but I have my sources.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seems he's been much more active of late. That tempts headstrong Daevas, which in turn leads them to that Soul Healing I mentioned before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both Indratu's activity and the carnage he's leaving behind concern me. I'd like to "hire" you to do something about both.</p>

          <p>Then go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDLF3_Castle_Indratoo] and slay [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NagaFighterNM_47_Ah]. It'll stop both the Daevas and whatever plans the Brigadier has.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It will obviously not be easy. I suggest you do not follow the lead of those reckless Daevas we've been discussing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, time is of the essence in more ways than one. Indratu's plotting...whatever Daevas are even now running to engage him....</p>

          <p>Hmm. I know we've been discussing the perils of recklessness, but overcaution isn't a virtue either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I would be a hypocrite if I forced you to fight a foe you didn't feel prepared to defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suggest you gain further strength, then return. There is still a task that needs doing.</p>

          <p>The type of Daeva who have battled Brigadier Indratu and failed are a type I saw very often during my combat days in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Newly ascended, stubborn, full of hope and much too much confidence in their own worth. They think little and pay for it accordingly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps their failures at Indratu Fortress will teach them a lesson. Speaking of which...?</p>

          <p>Well done! You've killed two Methus with one axe today. Whatever the Brigadier's schemes were will fall apart now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know it's not my job to be concerned about injured Daevas, but Asmodae needs them. They must learn their lesson. Hopefully they have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You require a proper reward. Take this--it's something I picked up during my travels. You should find it useful.</p>

          <p>Shadow Executor Savrina was concerned about Balaur Brigadier Indratu's activity, not to mention the Daevas who were being hurt trying to fight him.</p>

          <p>You invaded Indratu Fortress and slew the Balaur officer. Savrina was glad that whatever plans he was making were now over.</p>
