          <p>Each scholar chooses between morality and academic ambition. There's a huge debate about experimenting on live bodies in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To some extent, the research must continue. Almost anything can be done for good or evil, don't you agree?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think scholars alone should make that choice.</p>

          <p>I admit I have my doubts, [%username]. I've considered it carefully since Centurion Sarantus first sent his request.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine studying a living body--what we might learn! Even more exciting, the Lepharists have made an artificial test subject.</p>

          <p>As a scholar, I can make an objective evaluation. What the Lepharist Revolutionaries achieved is something great.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With their technology, our research could leap forward to dazzling heights...or it could destroy us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We cannot rush forward. The test subjects must be destroyed. [%username], will you help me?</p>
