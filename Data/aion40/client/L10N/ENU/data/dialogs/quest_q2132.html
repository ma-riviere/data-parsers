          <p>You must be [%username]. I saw you fighting earlier.... You pack quite a punch mate! It's good to see someone who knows that swingin' a blade around and screamin' like a loon will only get you so far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I like your style. Speed, poise, balance, precision, and flair: all the hallmarks of an able Warrior. I'll be keepin' an eye on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, you're here to learn a new skill, eh?</p>

          <p>Haha! At this rate I'll be learning from you soon, [%username]. For now though, feel free to buy Skill Manuals from me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, you can still buy my manuals even if you can't yet learn from them. You can read them later, when you've gained the experience.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm Wiokan, the Scout Trainer here in Aldelle Village. There aren't many of us, but we're always useful in a scrap--just ask Ulgorn. Unfortunately, there are some who don't appreciate the work we do--like that Tobu. I once heard him say Scouts are just Warriors with good eyesight! Can you believe it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, if he weren't second in command, I'd go prove him wrong!</p>

          <p>Oh, gotcha.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have all the skills you'll need in the near future. You can buy the ones you need now, or you can spend a bit more and get Skill Manuals you can't yet use. It's up to you, [%username].</p>

          <p>Don't look so surprised. You've been making quite a name for yourself, and I figured it was just a matter of time until you needed to pick up some new skills.</p>

          <p>You came to the right place. I sell the best Skill Manuals around these parts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strange...you seem to attract Aether like no other. I wonder... Well, I'm sure you want to get on with your training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I was saying, I sell Skill Manuals to Mages of varying abilities. Some of my manuals are too advanced for you right now, but don't let that dissuade you from buying them. You can learn from Skill Manuals at any time, even in the field. If you can afford them, I'd suggest you buy as many as you can to save yourself some traveling time.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Quick point I want to make clear regardin' Skill Manuals: you won't be able to learn all of the ones I sell, not at first, anyway. You need some more experience out in the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're strugglin' with all the extra Kinah on you, you may as well buy the advanced manuals now and save yourself a few trips back here.</p>

          <p>So, what'll it be, then?</p>
