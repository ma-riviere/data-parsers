          <p>Some scientific pursuit of Nestor's. He's one of our researchers stationed in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has been asking for Lobnite fossils for weeks. I promised him one by tomorrow for some report that he's writing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I even set time aside for it--then we get the report of a giant creature circling the citadel. I've got to organize our defenses!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What about you, [%username]? I need someone who can fly and is willing to help.</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The fossils aren't hard to find, but they are high up on the cliff faces--only accessible by flight. Fortunately, Lobnites haven't changed much. I'm sure you'll recognize their distinctive shells and have no problem collecting them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should get going. Time is running out.</p>
