          <p>Daeva, Yadamonerk does not understand something. If Gestanerk has died, who steers the Kerubar?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kerubar would not have killed Gestanerk--or would they?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something very bad happened. Yadamonerk's whiskers are shaking. The Meniherk Excavation Union is in trouble, nyerk.</p>
