          <p>Dealing with the command officers of the Bastion is the best way to get at them, I think. They have so many grunts, it's pointless to strike at their main force.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only the senior staff know anything. That's where we have to hit them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd like to keep up the attacks. Keep striking at them while they're still trying to reorganize from our last hit.</p>

          <p>The most important remaining officers at the Bastion are Highpriest Rhipel and Highmage Wyron, but we've decided not to kill them yet. Instead we're going to send them a message.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your task will be to eliminate Rhipel's bodyguard, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparAsNamedQ_39_Ae], and Highmage Wyron's favorite pupil [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparWiNamedQ_39_Ae].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That'll send them a message. They'll know that we can take them down anytime, whenever we want.</p>

          <p>Very little is known about [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparAsNamedQ_39_Ae], so watch out. We don't even have a reliable description. It's said that no one left alive has seen Scop's face.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In contrast, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF2_LehparWiNamedQ_39_Ae] is very well known for his magical skills. He's reputed to be very handsome...face of an angel, soul of a devil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither will be an easy target, but this is a critical mission for our strategy. Don't fail.</p>

          <p>I understand the desire to strike directly, but think about it, [%username]. Leaving those terrified officers in a position of power will paralyze the Lepharists. If you kill them, they'll be replaced with effective underlings.</p>

          <p>Great! That should have put the fear of the five in them. Now we just let them stew for a while...let that terror fester....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Soon they'll start reorganizing the Bastion defenses strictly to protect their own hides, and open gaps elsewhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll eventually eliminate Rhipel and Wyron, but they'll wreck the cohesion of the Lepharist defenses first. Brilliant, eh?</p>
