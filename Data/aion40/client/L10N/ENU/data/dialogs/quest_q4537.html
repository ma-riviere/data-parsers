          <p>Heard you talking with Alfgeir, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wasn't being rude--Alfgeir just has a boomy old voice, particularly when he gets all excited. Had some drunken falling out with his wife a few weeks ago; that was awkward the next day.</p>

          <p>Sounds like he had reason to celebrate this time, though. Not many can take on both Kirrins and Karnifs at the same time, yet I heard you went through them like a sandstorm through Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, if the stories are true, I could use your help. Command at Beluslan Fortress has sent out orders to kill off all the nearby creatures that pose a threat to us. That means Kirrins, Vespines, Caltrops, Kurins, Gnarls, Ettins...everything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been assigned Grankers and their young, and I'm a bit out of my depth. I need your help.</p>

          <p>I had a feeling you'd help, [%username]! Thank you!</p>

          <p>Now, I'll deal with the Silver Grankers, so I just need help with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BighorndeerMinerD_33_n]s. They're smaller than the Grankers, and won't attack you on sight. Just be careful you don't wander into anything that might attack you mid-fight though.</p>

          <p>We'll meet back here! Blood for blood!</p>
