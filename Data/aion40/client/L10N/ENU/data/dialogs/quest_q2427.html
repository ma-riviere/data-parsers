          <p>I need to start all over again: somewhere safe and quiet, where there are no Spirits, no Lepharists--nothing to threaten my research. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Spirits attacked my lab, I grabbed my potions and research materials. I wanted to save them at all costs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I put the bottles into a box, flung the research materials into a barrel, and fled.</p>

          <p>It was too much to carry. The [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2_WoodenBox_Q2427] was especially heavy because it contained all that glass. I had to put it down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I carried the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_DF2_Barrel_Q2427] a little farther...but I had to escape...I thought I could retrieve everything later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really need the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2427a] and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2427b]. [%username], assuming they survived, would you please find them for me?</p>
