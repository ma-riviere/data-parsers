          <p>Well, we have a weekly wager on who can hunt the most Calydons. I'd really like to win one, and I'm not really concerned with how.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know who won last time? A Shugo called Nagrunerk. He's small, but he's good at poisons.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I hate losing to a Shugo, so if you're willing, I'll pay you to hunt some Calydons for me.</P>
