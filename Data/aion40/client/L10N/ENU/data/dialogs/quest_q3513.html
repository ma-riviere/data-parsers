        	<p>Here's the thing--</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been working on an entirely new style of armor, much stronger and more flexible than the kind you're familiar with. It will revolutionize armed combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A colleague of mine is also working on a new type of body armor, using Clodworm Leather. It's pretty good but....</p>

          <p>Exactly! And I need to build my armor before he takes his idea to the fortress. If he gets there first, he'll get all the military funding, and I'll be left holding nothing but regrets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My secret? Basilisk Leather! It's stronger than Clodworm Leather, much lighter, it breathes better, it's resistant to fire and some magic...it's the perfect material.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I need quite a bit of it. At the very least, I'll need ten [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1523a]s. Actually, I'll take as much as you can get. I'll reward you very handsomely.</p>

          <p>Oh, beautiful, beautiful...see how it glistens? See, if you pull it, it stays firm? See the quality of this skin? This is perfect!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once it's tanned properly, no half-decent sword should be able to pierce it. I stake my reputation on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, thank you. You've helped make this deranged Daeva's dreams come true. This isn't much, but please accept my gratitude.</p>
