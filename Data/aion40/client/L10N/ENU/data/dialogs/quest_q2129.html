          <p>Those sneaky Mau down in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_9] are lookin' more and more dodgy every day. I don't like it, not one bit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, I've been watchin' the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_12_An]s over the last few weeks. I ain't no strategic mastermind or nothin', but I do know when those Mau get trainin', they do it for a reason. Their chief, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_13_An], is mobilizing his lot for somethin' big...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I had to guess, I'd say they're getting ready for a raid.... Against us.</p>

          <p>Yeah, I thought so, too. So I went to Aldelle Village, and the boss just says "Nalto, you're a big tough lad, you show them kitties what the raiders are made of!"</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thing is, there's over forty of them Mau down there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked around, but no one else will help out. And here I was, thinkin' this post would be a right old breeze....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about you? Will you help by takin' out a few of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_12_An]s and maybe even [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_13_An] himself? They're all deep inside the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_9].</p>

          <p>You've gotta be a tough nut to have gotten this far, but still--them tabbies ain't no walkover. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_13_An] is huge, and you'll have to be in tip-top form if you're gonna best him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have everything you need, I suggest you hurry and get to it before them Mau get their raid started. Head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_9] and get crackin'!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And while you're at it, report back to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA494]. Tell him that I handled the matter... You know what I mean, right?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it, all right? The safety of the whole village is at stake here, and there ain't no way I'm gonna come out alive if I try to stop 'em...</p>

          <p>Wait... there's something you're not telling me. Look me in the eye and tell me it was Nalto who did this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmph. Thought not! I don't look kindly on my bandits trying to pull one over on me. I'll let you off this time, since you're new. But Nalto, on the other hand...</p>
