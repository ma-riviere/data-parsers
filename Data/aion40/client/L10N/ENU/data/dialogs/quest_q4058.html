          <p>Ah, I'm just so frustrated, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been sent here on an urgent matter. We're checking which regions are contaminated and how far contamination has progressed in each region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Interlopers have made investigating the contamination in Adma Plains difficult, however. We're overwhelmed with the workload. Can you help us out?</p>

          <p>Just a few samples. Peckus are particularly resilient to all levels of toxins. By hunting Peckus, we can examine their tissue for the level of contamination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But sampling isn't easy because Petrahulks would attack us while we were tagging the Peckus. It would be a big help if you, [%username], would remove the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CyclopsWorkerD_48_An]s for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you help us?</p>
