          <p>It really is tragic, and it's infuriating to think that it all started because of that giant Balaur weapon in the middle of the village.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the damage isn't limited to Humans. It also affects animals and spirits.</p>

          <p>The Cold Earth Spirits in Besfer Ghost Village. They've always been there, but of late they've gotten more violent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're making it more and more difficult for Gigrite and I to do the job we came to do.</p>

          <p>Thank you--that will help us so much.</p>

          <p>You can find the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth3SnowD_34_An]s in Besfer Ghost Village. You should bring [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2529a]s back to me, so I can keep track of them.</p>

          <p>Svera said Besfer Ghost Village was polluted by the weapon of a Dragon Lord, and that not only Humans, but also animals and spirits were affected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She and Gigrite were having a hard time purifying the undead because they were constantly interrupted by attacks from the Cold Earth Spirits. You eliminated them and collected their Violet Crystals.</p>
