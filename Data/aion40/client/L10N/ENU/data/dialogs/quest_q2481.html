          <p>A special mission in Elysea. I was asked to bring back a piece of a Caryatid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently there was once an artifact surrounded by Caryatids. It disappeared--we're not sure why--and then the Caryatids went insane, attacking everything. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some scholars wanted a piece of one for research to find out what makes them violent.</p>
