          <p>You better not be bringing new orders! I'm done being yanked around by rear-echelon Brax-patties from Primum with no idea what it's like out on the tip of the Asmodian spear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't take the field, anyway. The chaos of the Abyss and the broiling air are wrecking our weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd be fine, but we're out of protective oil for our blades after so many missions.</p>

          <p>Yeah, something I figured out--by accident, really--a few years ago. If you coat a weapon with the melted heart of a Ravenous Pretor, it won't warp in heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Over the years, I've taught all my soldiers to protect their weapons. One of my lieutenants, Hildebrant, got promoted to command of Krotan Rock, and lately I hear she 'discovered' the stuff herself. She always was an ambitious little twerp.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What we need are the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2824a]s. The island is crawling with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1241_Pretor_38_An]s; that part's easy. But I have no guards to spare from their posts.</p>

          <p>Be careful. Those Ravenous Pretors wade in lava. That should give you an idea of how tough they are.</p>
          <p> </p>
			<p>Get those hearts back to me, and I'll make the fluid for the troops' weapons.</p>

          <p>Fleeing is a strategy, too, I suppose. We just don't employ it much here on Miren Island.</p>

          <p>No excuses. Excuses won't keep our weapons from warping, after all.</p>

          <p>Still ice cold--these hearts are perfect.</p>

          <p>I'll melt these right away and distribute a batch of protective fluid to the troops.</p>
