          <p>Ah, yes. Centurion Vinduer has always stood out in my mind. A man of charm and grace, if not airs and appearances.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We met at some parties. He's quite different from other men. Didn't even ask me to dance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps that's why I remember him.</p>

          <p>I suspect his refusal to lick the boots of anyone led to his exile out here.</p>

          <P>When I was assigned here, I thought I might be able to meet him here, and...well, kindle things.</P>
          <P> </P>
          <P>He deserves better, really. We need more warriors like him.</P>
