          <p>I wager ya're wonderin' how ol' Cap'n Jackdaw came to be out here alone, like a landlubber. Why is a pirate e'er anywhere? Fer the treasure, o' course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alas, me men wanted the treasure more'n me, Daevie. Not more'n Jackdaw wanted it...they wanted it more'n they wanted Jackdaw. But Lord Marchutan gives e'ery sailor exactly what they deserve...ya see. Me mutinous men roam this beach now cursed to be monsters, hoho!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They can't sail because they are monsters, but they can't leave the sea because they're pirates. Fate can be cruel, Daevie.</p>
