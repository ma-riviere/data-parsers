          <p>This is my home. I'd lost it all, except my health. I came to Brusthonin and joined the Daevas headed for the north.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My friends worry. S'posed to be too tough for Humans, but I'm fine. There'll be good land here for every Asmodian refugee when I'm done!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No more being pushed back. Balaur, pollution, Elyos? Blazes with them. This is OUR land.</p>
