          <p>There aren't many Archons in Brusthonin. Hristi and I are the only ones in this area. That makes it tough. There's a lot to do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm working on identifying the degree of the contamination, and reporting it to Centurions Phyper and Vinduer.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's important work. Reclaiming Brusthonin would give us more cropland to help feed our troops. And some of my ancestors used to live in Brusthonin, so I feel a kinship for this place.</p>
