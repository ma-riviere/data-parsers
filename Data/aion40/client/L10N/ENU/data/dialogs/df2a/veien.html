          <p>I wonder what you must think of Brusthonin. Kunne and I heard that, with a little more cultivation, it could become a land of gold.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know when it was fertile, but now it's a wasteland.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And help is scarce. The Wisdom Orb Daevas do nothing but chat near the fire. We don't have enough supplies or laborers, and Archons from Pandaemonium are few and far between. They're so shorthanded, they've organized us farmers as Watch members.</p>
