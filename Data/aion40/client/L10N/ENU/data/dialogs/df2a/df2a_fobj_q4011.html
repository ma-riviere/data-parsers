          <p>How have you been? You left at just the right time, friend. Less than half my spring seeds sprouted, and the plants are all sickly. Most won't make it to harvest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No stores left after the Winter. What the blazes can I do? Should have gone when you did, it seems. No point in regret, though.</p>

          <p>Anyway, I hear you settled in Ishalgen, right? Never heard the name before, and don't know where it is, but if it's where you staked your claim it's got to be better than here!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How's the farming? Krimm said the locals are nice. If you like it, I'd seriously consider making the trip. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Help an old friend? Send along your impressions of Ishalgen. I'll be waiting for your reply.</p>
