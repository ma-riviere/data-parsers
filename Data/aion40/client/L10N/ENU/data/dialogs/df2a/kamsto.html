          <p>Do you know what fascinates me about the Brohums? They're a paradox: they can be so violent and territorial, and yet in their daily life they live in such harmony with nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just look at their homes, so fresh and green. I wish I could understand it.</p>

          <p>Perhaps they let people in, only for those people to destroy the habitat the Brohums love. Just a working theory.</p>
