          <p>Vindachinerk will be heartbroken when he sees Jaiorunerk's Diary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has always held a special affection for Jaiorunerk. He was his first pupil and Vindachinerk never believed the rumors of his death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He insisted that he would live to see Jaiorunerk's return.</p>

          <p>Yes.... I should deliver this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_7], but...I've so many things to do around here...and I can't bear seeing his face at such news....</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_AB1_7] is a mistrusting Shugo, so meeting with him may be difficult.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Try meeting Minonerk first. That's his other pupil. He is almost as suspicious as his master, so show him Jaiorunerk's diary first.</p>
