          <p>Ascension is a rapturous occasion for all Daevas. I both congratulate and warn you. Grave danger lies ahead, and your resolve will be tested to the limit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You do not flinch at this. There is steel in your gaze that speaks more clearly than any words. I see many new Daevas with blank stares and weak wills. You are not cut from that cloth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell me--what is it that sets you apart?</p>

          <p>Strange indeed. To have fought the Balaur in Karamatis, deep in the Abyss...and yet here you are before me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tales of Karamatis run through the cracks of the city--dark whispers of Balaur occupation. This is the first I have heard of our forces fighting in that place.</p>

          <p>A Daeva who has lost power and memory, re-rendered into Human form--it's unheard of. I must consult Jucleas to discern the truth of it before we can discuss this further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I said that grave danger lies ahead--this is the path of the Daeva. Whatever Pernos showed you, for now you must focus on the task at hand.</p>

          <p>Verteron Citadel needs assistance, but before you, there was no one to send. Go quickly.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Verteron is taking heavy losses against the Tursin Krall. And now we've received word that a group resembling the Lepharist Revolutionaries is active in the area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Polyidus] in the Gate of Sanctum about teleportation to Verteron. He'll set you on your way.</p>
