          <p>Most of the manuscripts I restore are written in Asmodian or the language of our ancestors. But every once in a while I get a document written in the language of the Elyos--or even the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bought a very expensive potion from a Shugo to learn the Balaur language. But you can't learn Elyos by quaffing a potion, and they don't exactly teach it in school, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos sell me Elyos books from time to time and I deconstruct them as best I can. I'm writing my own Elyos dictionary, as a matter of fact.</p>

          <p>Intriguing...It's a strange mix of Elyos and Asmodian. You'd have to be perfectly bilingual to really understand it, I think. You say you got it from a Elyos spirit?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm...it's a request of some kind. Someone--a spy, perhaps?--wants to know details of Aether levels...in Elysea? Can that be right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll write up a translated version, but there's no way I can deliver it to the intended recipient: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hellione] in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_FTW].</p>
