          <p>Munin looked into the future and saw a place in Elysea called Poeta, invaded by the Balaur and laid to waste.</p>

          <p>But it's not Poeta's fate that should concern you, [%username], it's your own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Balaur general by the name of Anuhart has something that can change your fate and Atreia's, and it's going to be your job to get it away from him.</p>
