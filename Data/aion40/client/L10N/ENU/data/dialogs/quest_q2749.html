          <p>I lie awake at night because if I sleep, I dream of the assault on the fortress, and I wake up screaming.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I never imagined for a wing beat that we would lose Siel's Western Fortress so suddenly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we must plan a strategy to recapture the fortress and not dwell on our mistakes.</p>

          <p>The Elyos occupied the fortress when we last scouted. However, there was an attack by the blasted Balaur so we don't yet know which side holds the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end it doesn't matter which enemy's hand holds the fortress. We must recapture it. Oh, to sleep again, to dream of home and darkness!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ahem. Gather your allies and defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2749_all], including all fortress fighters and fortress archers. I mean all: Elyos and Balaur. </p>

          <p>Well, [%username], it seems that you live up to your reputation! You have made a bold strike against the enemy and made it easier to recapture the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We may have to send in more sorties though, as there are more garrisons to take out. I'd appreciate it if you'd help us again.</p>
