          <p>Keep this quiet, [%username], but there is some food in the area. A strange plant called [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q4006] grows at the Havenjark Farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, it's crawling with undead, but the Frightcorn Fruit fills their bellies and restores their strength.</p>

          <p>I secretly made the vigilantes and laborers eat some and nobody died. Admittedly, Vitda was rather sick, but...</p>

          <p>If we can get a large amount of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4006a] from [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Q4006], I can stretch our supplies a bit more.</p>
