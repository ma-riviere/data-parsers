          <p>Frustrating, yes. I've been looking for ways to ease my mind, so last night I tried writing a letter to my son. It actually felt good to get some of my worries down on paper.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I need the thing delivered. I don't trust the mail, and I'll surely not let a Shugo courier get his paws on something so personal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course I'm too old to make the journey myself....</p>

          <p>I saw my father in a dream last night. He looked distressed, waving frantically and trying to speak, but I could hear nothing.</p>
