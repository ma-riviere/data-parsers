          <p>I take a certain amount of pride in my cooking and I want to treat Balom to a meal of Abex roasted over Salix Wood. It's one of his favorite foods.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>When I roast the Abex meat on it, the meat will soak up that wonderful fragrance. Balom will really like it, don't you think? Maybe he'll finally put me in charge of the Tripeeds.</p>
