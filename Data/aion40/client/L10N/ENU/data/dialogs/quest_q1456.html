          <p>You might think attaching jewels to armor is extravagant, but jewels aren't simply decorative, they also bestow special powers. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They block physical attacks or even protect the wearer from magic! And that's why experienced [%userclass]s prefer armor decorated with jewels.</p>

          <p>Lots of different kinds. I find lots of Garnet, Lazuli, and Moonstone around here. The rarer jewels make the armor very expensive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they're still quite popular. Just today the guardians from Sataloca's Tomb sent an urgent order for jeweled armor. Because it's urgent, I think they must be shipping out soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to hurry but don't have enough Garnets, which are the most important material. Would you please help me, Daeva?</p>
