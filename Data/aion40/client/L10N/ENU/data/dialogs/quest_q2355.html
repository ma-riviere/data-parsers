          <p>I know the perfect target. [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ZombieNamedD_28_Ae] is a real legend around here. Tough, strong, terrifying. The price on his undead hide has stood for ages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you kill him, [%username]? Keep whatever you find, the reward as well. I only want the recognition.</p>
