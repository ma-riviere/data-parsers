          <p>The Lyceum is a sacred place where we come together to serve our fellow Daevas and offer up our praises to the Five Seraphim Lords who watch over us eternally.</p>

          <p>Five are they, the Lords of Light, who stand sentinel over the shattered orb of Atreia!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They represent the five essential values: Light, Justice, Liberty, Illusion, and Life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are not just distant figures of worship. They sometimes manifest here in Sanctum in person. I have no words to describe such beauty. You are never the same again after you've beheld one of the Seraphim Lords in their full glory.</p>
