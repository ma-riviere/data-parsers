          <p>What a pity. Such a wise and noble Daeva who's never heard of the best games around.</p>

          <p>Well, you roll the dice and whoever gets the highest number wins. It's easy. I have two sets of dice right here. You'll need to use this pair. These others are mine. They're uh...lucky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Summoning Stick is easy, too. You use an enchanted stick that summons a little monster, and you hit the monster with the stick. Whoever bludgeons the monster quickest wins the pot. Too bad they banned it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't see the harm, myself. Nothing wrong with a game between friends, eh?</p>
