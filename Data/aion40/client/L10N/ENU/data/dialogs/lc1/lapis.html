          <p>Isn't it a beautiful day? I just want to soar into the light and feel it with my entire essence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look at Bella dance. She's radiant! Watching her dance makes me happy, deep down inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She must be a gift from the Seraphim Lords, to lift our spirits in times of darkness.</p>

          <p>I tried to learn to dance, many years ago. I won't say how long ago it was. You're a Daeva, you understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But not all of us are so gifted as Bella. I tried, but I'm clumsy, like a tipolid in a Shugo shop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After years of practice I...I just gave up. Now I content myself with watching Bella dance.</p>
