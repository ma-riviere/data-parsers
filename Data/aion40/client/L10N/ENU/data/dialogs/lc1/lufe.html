          <p>My husband Lukian works at the dock. Today he's taken our young son Basmos with him, saying he'll teach him how to be a dock laborer. That's them, over there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I want to ask is, well...don't you think one dock laborer in the family is enough? Basmos is my son, and I want the best for him! I want to see him clad in armor, winging his way through the clouds, not hauling crates and spitting over the ledge!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came here to change Lukian's mind, but every time I try to talk to him, the words just stick in my throat.</p>

          <p>I have four sons. I wanted one of them to ascend and achieve glory. Just one. It's not too much to ask, is it?</p>
