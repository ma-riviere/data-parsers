          <p>Idiots! Why not walk around with a cauldron on your head? Good armor has to be comfortable, strong, and attractive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neglect any of those aspects, and you're not making armor. You're making trash.</p>

          <p>I don't make ordinary armor here.</p>

          <p>Heroes like that deserve nothing less than our very best efforts.</p>
