          <p>Every day, hundreds...thousands of Elyos pass through Sanctum. Merchants bring crates and crates of stuff--exotic foods, fine minerals, jewels, cloth, spices--all the bounty of Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you never know when someone'll try to smuggle something in. It happens, you know--forbidden poisons, venomous little creatures, dangerous magic scrolls...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And me? I inspect everything that comes through here. Nothing gets past me.</p>
