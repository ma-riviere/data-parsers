          <p>You know what a gift that is? I'm never afraid! Not ever. Why worry about anything? I know exactly how I'll die. I don't waste time pouring over past battles, or fretting about those to come. I just drop the enemy in front of me, then move on to the next.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if Lord Marchutan appears on the field, I won't be afraid. I'll only stop when there are none left to stand against me. That, [%username]...is true freedom.</p>
