          <p>Long ago, one Daeva's thirst for knowledge was too great. Daeva was obsessed--thought of only potions day and night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, he flew too far. Stole a secret ingredient, taken from secret temple. Mixed a potion, but did not know its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Foolish Daeva had to test the mixture. Said to no one, "Skilled Daeva can always make antidote to fix problems." </p>

          <p>Daeva drank deeply, and gained knowledge. Also, large clumsy paws and big teeth. Could no longer mix potions, much less antidotes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could not speak, and neither Elyos nor Shugo was witness. Silly Daeva forgot most important Shugo lesson, and was expelled from Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too much learning is dangerous thing, but partners should always know where the Kinah comes from, yes?</p>
