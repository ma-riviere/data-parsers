          <p>Any Daeva is welcome to explore the Divine Road, but remember--no Humans past this point. It's not allowed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Personally I don't agree with it, but I don't make the laws. The Divine Road is supposed to be sacred, so no Humans can walk on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course there's an exception for some. But you'd have to have a permit.</p>
