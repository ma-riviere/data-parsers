          <p>When it comes to food, there are two main things to consider: flavor and health. Most people only consider flavor. I don't care how delicious it tastes. If it isn't good for you, you shouldn't be putting it in your mouth. Nor anyone else's!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't very well expect to win this war if we don't feed our soldiers nutritious rations, can we?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both are a matter of preparation. A well-prepared chef is a successful chef.</p>

          <p>Cooking is a matter of life and death...perhaps not immenent death--hopefully nobody's getting decapitated--but cooking gives life. Good cooking makes life worth living. And a life worth living is a life worth fighting for.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So if you cook, cook well.</p>

          <p>Look, Cooking isn't as easy as you seem to think it is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, any idiot can toast bread or boil an egg--I'm not arguing that. But that simply isn't good enough for the work we're doing here.</p>

          <p>If you care and really want to do this properly, you'll take some lessons in Cooking from me.</p>
