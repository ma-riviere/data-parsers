          <p>Transformation is a specialized discipline. Most Daevas know nothing about it, and nobody's good enough to deserve the title of expert. Well, not yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Persistence is the key. Most people give up after only a few weeks. "It's too hard," they say, and "What's the point?" Not everyone sees the advantage of turning into a Porgus or a Brax.</p>

          <p>It involves channeling power directly from the Empyrean Lord Kaisinel himself. I plan to be the first  to achieve mastery at it. When I'm recognized as a Master, you can apply to learn from me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact...you could help right now. I've deciphered an invocation that turns the subject into a tiny amphibian of some sort. May I test it on you?</p>

          <p>Lord Kaisinel's power to me send, flesh to form and bones to bend! Looks may change under Aether's lamp, let [%username] become tiny, green, web-footed and damp!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hrmph.... That should have worked. Maybe there's an obstruction in the flow of Aether. We'll have to try again later.</p>

          <p>What's wrong? You don't believe in transformation? Or you doubt my abilities?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I understand. I'm used to the cynicism of the ignorant. When I master the art of transformation you'll wish you'd helped me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There'll be plenty of people clamoring to learn from me, but if you ask nicely I'll add you to the list. The bottom of the list, of course.</p>
