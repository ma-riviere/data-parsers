          <p>Elysea is a huge place. Running and flying will only get you so far--and they're so slow!</p>

          <p>That's where teleporters like me come in. Just tell me your destination and I'll send you there instantly. Where do you want to go?</p>

          <p>Hmm. Only Daevas can use the teleportation device. I should have mentioned that, I suppose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas simply have abilities that Humans don't. It's not a matter of prejudice--just the way things are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It can't be easy for a Human in a city of Daevas. At least you can take the airships. You can use them without the power of Aether.</p>
