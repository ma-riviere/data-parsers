          <p>I'm so glad you talked to me! I was wondering...could I become a Daeva like you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mom says I can, but Dad says an honest life on the docks was good enough for him and it'll be good enough for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I promised Mom I'd ask, just to calm her down. Could I ascend? Ever?</p>

          <p>Oh, everyone says that. But...have you heard of those Elyos who think they can ascend through penance?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They starve themselves, put themselves through all kinds of suffering. The more they suffer, the holier they get. Sounds insane to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess I'll carry on working at the docks for now. I'll tell Mom it's down to destiny, and she shouldn't worry about it anymore.</p>
