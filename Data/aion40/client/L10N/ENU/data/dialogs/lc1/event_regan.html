          <p>I've been told that we're celebrating the ascensions of the first Daevas not directly chosen by Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's become a lot more than that. It's a day of thanksgiving, and a reminder of efforts that some, even Daevas, take for granted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not to mention, it's a day when Daevas can relax for a little while and enjoy some of their eternal life. I hope you're enjoying yours!</p>
