          <p>Hail, Daeva! Take heart! There are glorious times ahead. Soon, there will be honor in abundance for every Elyos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Asmodian filth have taunted the Five Seraphim Lords long enough. There will be a reckoning soon to be sure, and those dirty furbacks will pay!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Stand firm, friend! If you follow the will of the Five and do your part in the battle against the arrogant brats of Asmodae, you'll share in the bounty that is to come!</p>
