          <p>Daeva is surprised to see a Shugo not trading? Not all treasures can be exchanged for Kinah, yes?</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daarunerk's passionate search for truth is not unique. Unlike Daevas or Humans stuck inside reading, reading, reading, he has visited all places in...has traveled to see things for himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowledge comes from experience, not books. Shugos who travel collect opportunites and Kinah along with memories. These things make a Shugo truly rich.</p>
