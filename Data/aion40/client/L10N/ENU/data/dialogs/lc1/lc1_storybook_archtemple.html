          <p>Sanctum, glorious Sanctum! City in the clouds, city of divinity!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There could be no grander sight than the light of dawn glinting off its golden towers!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The history of Sanctum is almost as old as the history of Atreia itself!</p>

          <p>Sanctum was not always the flying palace of divine radiance that it is today. The history of Sanctum begins long, long ago in the time of the Twelve Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Humans were just beginning to ascend as Daevas then, and Lady Siel realized that it would be the responsibility of the Empyrean Lords to train and lead these brave warriors of winged justice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lady Siel established a temple for Daevas to stay and study. As the other Empyrean Lords joined in her mission, a city of Daevas and worshippers grew around the temple.</p>

          <p>Despite the humble Lady's protests, the city came to be called Siela, after she who founded it. It was the center of ancient Atreia, as we hear in the phrase "all roads lead to Siela."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was here that the first Legion was trained, here that the battles of the Millennium War were planned, and here that the Twelve Empyrean Lords met in council to debate that fateful peace conference.</p>

          <p>Siela was devastated by the chaos of the Cataclysm. Covered in ash and rubble, it seemed that Siela would never regain its former glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet the magnificent Lady Ariel would not give up hope for Atreia. She decided that Siela would be rebuilt a hundred times grander than before.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All the denizens of Elysea poured their hearts and souls into the reconstruction, and after fifty years of hard toil the towers of Siela arose proud and tall from the former ruins.</p>

          <p>When Siela was rebuilt completely, a memorial service was held for all those who lost their lives in the tragic Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After a silent, mournful prayer in the dim light of dawn, the Seraphim Lords rose their voices in a divine chant. As the sun rose over the horizon, the city of Siela rose gracefully into the air.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ariel proclaimed that the city would be renamed Sanctum, a city elevated to the glorious heavens and protected from the dangers of the ground.</p>

          <p>Sanctum has dealt with the unique challenge of being a city in the sky. While at first only Daevas and their guests could enter the city, Mustapino's invention of the airship allowed all to fly to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the population of Elysea has grown over the years, Sanctum has been expanded, more islands and towers raised into the air alongside the old city.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here is a woefully incomplete list of the wonders that Sanctum has to offer you, O Pilgrim!</p>

          <p>Sky Canal</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Where once a river ran through Siela, now a great canal of sky traverses the city. Airships pass to and fro, going about their business.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The view from the bridges is one of the most magnificent sights in Atreia. The troubles of your everyday life will float away before such a grand panorama.</p>

          <p>Outer Dock</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This small island was lifted into the skies along Sanctum to provide a cargo hub for the growing airship trade. Though a rough neighborhood, it has its charms.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Visitors looking for the complete Sanctum experience should stop by the Dionysia Tavern, but take care to keep hold of their purses.</p>

          <p>The glorious seat of Sanctum's government, this tower rises high into the sky, symbolizing the Empyrean Lords watching down upon all of us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The doors of the hall are always open to visitors, but please, do not trouble the Daevas with your insignificant problems.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Built at Lord Nezekan's request to provide a space for his Legions to train, the Coliseum also serves as a stage for exciting gladiatorial battles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tickets often sell out for popular fights, so buy yours in advance!</p>

          <p>Lyceum</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Through these halls have passed all the greatest minds of Elysea. Here, Scholars and philosophers debate the nature of Aion and the meaning of life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps your contributions to this grand debate will shape the future of intellectual discourse for years to come!</p>
