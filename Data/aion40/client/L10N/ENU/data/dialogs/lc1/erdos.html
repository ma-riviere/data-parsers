          <p>No, no, I mean the Scout skill! Hiding draws on the power of Aether to conceal you by warping light around you. You're supposed to be able to evade enemies or lie in wait for them unseen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's presuming you can actually do it, which I apparently can't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I'm not a Scout, but that's no reason not to try, is it?</p>
