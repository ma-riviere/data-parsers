          <p>I call all my fellow Daevas "kinsmen," you know. It's a habit of mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No offence given, I trust.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I find it easier to empathize with people if I think of them as my brothers and sisters. It makes the act of reciting poetry for them...personal...more intimate.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, but I can't produce a poem for you just off the cuff. I'm an artist, not a short order chef.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone like Valendir rattles off a poem every five minutes, full of flowery words and pretty phrases, but I take my craft seriously.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Poetry has to come from the heart or it's meaningless. I require solitude and peace to create. I prefer to do my writing alone, in the middle of the night, while the city sleeps.</p>
