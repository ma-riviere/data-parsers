          <p>Technique is important in handicrafts, but you also need that artistic touch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without an eye and hand for design, anything you make will simply be functional. It won't have the element of beauty to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why learning handicrafts isn't for everyone.</p>
