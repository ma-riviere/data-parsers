          <p>Hello, Daeva! My parents are both Daevas like you and that means I'll be a Daeva too right? I m sure I'll ascend because I never sleep, I don't know why. I had a nanny but she had some kind of breakdown and they had to give her medicine from the alchemist to calm her down and everything and she's okay now but she had to go back to Poeta but I don't know if that had anything to do with being my fault but listen if you ever need to talk or you need help finding anything in Sanctum let me know 'cause I know where everything is in the whole city except on the Divine Road because they won't let me go there which is completely unfair don't you agree?</p>
