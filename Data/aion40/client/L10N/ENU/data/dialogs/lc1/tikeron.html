          <p>Huge volumes of goods come through Sanctum every day. We can't inspect each crate individually, of course.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We find other ways to detect contraband. Utsida built me a special instrument that tastes the Aether in the container. Finds anything that shouldn't be there, no matter how well hidden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Shugos think they're clever, squirreling their stuff away in secret compartments and under false layers. But we hold our own.</p>
