          <p>Your first visit, then? Right. If you wait a little, the boat to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA40] will pull along here. Little slow, but you get some of Sanctum's best views from her guardrails!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The boat's the only way to the Outer Dock, so if you have business there, best wait here for your ride.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, one other thing. When you go aboard, take care by the edge. You can see how high up we are. There's nothing between us and the ground but wispy clouds, and they won't break even a Daeva's fall!</p>
