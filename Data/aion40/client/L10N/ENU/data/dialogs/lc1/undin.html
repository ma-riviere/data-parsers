          <p>You there! What are you doing just hanging around my studio? Oh, you think you're ready to learn Construction, are you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me tell you something: Construction is no field for namby-pamby shade-touched WEAKLINGS! You look like you'd faint at the SIGHT of a hammer!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you're a real Elyos, if you dare to try to become something bigger than you are now... Let's see what you've got!</p>

          <p>So you can think you can work Construction without knowing anything about Construction? Are you really that DENSE?</p>

          <p>Get out of here! Until you know even the tiniest sharding thing about Construction, you're useless! Useless!!</p>
