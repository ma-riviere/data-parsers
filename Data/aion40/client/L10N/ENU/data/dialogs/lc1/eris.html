          <p>Ah, it's [%username]. I should have guessed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's odd. You're not quite so ugly as I'd been led to believe. I confess I'm a little disappointed. With all the things your so-called friend has been saying about you, I had to see the truth for myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What about all the other tales about you? A Daeva who's scared to fight, has grown fat from loafing about all the time, and cares about nothing but making Kinah? Are any of those tales true, too?</p>
