          <p>Ignorance creates fear. If you've never been to the Abyss, you may fear Balaur simply because you know little about them. But if you take the time to study them as I have, you gradually overcome that fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course it's wise to retain some fear of a powerful enemy. You should be aware of their capabilities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur are dangerous, but they can be defeated by brave Daevas using intelligent tactics</p>
