          <p>Why does Daeva stare? Mapirerk is no animal, but a free Shugo, yes?</p>

          <p>Wait, now Mapirerk has sadness, nyerk. Did not wish to offend.</p>

          <p>Mapirerk was a different Shugo then. So many trades, so much Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All gone thanks to idiot brother. Irresponsible. Foolish. Spends Kinah like water in the rain! Such sadness forces Mapirerk to Sanctum. Restitution. Fines, penalties!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, brother thinks life is just fine here. Mapirerk is now a young Shugo in old fur.</p>
