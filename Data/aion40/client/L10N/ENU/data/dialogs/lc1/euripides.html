          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. It's a pleasure to see you. Is there something you need?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, don't be shy. I've met many Daevas who feel uncomfortable with the body the Five Lords gave them. Some time ago I discovered a way to use Aether to...correct this error. With my help you can change your gender to suit your nature, whatever it may be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there's something I must ask of you--a token of sorts. The Gender Switch Ticket. It is sold by someone I trust. If you bring it to me, I will change you into whatever you want to be.</p>
