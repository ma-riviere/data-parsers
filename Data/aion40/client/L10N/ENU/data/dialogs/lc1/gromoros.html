          <p>Have you been to the Abyss? Daevas seem to see it as the ultimate testing ground, a place to earn honor and glory fighting their enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But to me, the Abyss is a mystery waiting to be solved. It's not just a matter of going there. I want to understand how it opens and closes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I spend all my time researching, but I'm still no closer to an answer. One day, my research will bear fruit, I promise you.</p>
