          <p>Any Legion worth the name needs a decent emblem. It's a badge of pride for everyone in the Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have to work hard to increase your Legion's level, however.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At level 2 you can modify your emblem. When you reach level 3 you're allowed to register a custom-designed emblem of your own creation.</p>

          <p>I'm afraid you can't just change your Legion emblem as readily as you change your socks. A Legion must reach at least level 2 before its emblem can be modified.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To register a self-made emblem, you need Legion level 3.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Off you go, work hard, and I'll see you again when you've earned the right to make changes.</p>
