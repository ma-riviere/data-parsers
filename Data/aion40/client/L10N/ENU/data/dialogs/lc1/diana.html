          <p>It seems everyone wants to learn Alchemy these days! Especially the young ones!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I know why. I'm not stupid. It's all about the Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These children think they can extract Aether from mud, weeds and rubbish, and sell the Essence for a fortune. If that were true we alchemists would all be kings and queens!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alchemy is about much more than making Kinah. It's about life itself.</p>

          <p>A talented alchemist can make you invisible or give you the strength for an extended flight. These gifts are of tremendous use to our people!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's really not about the Kinah.</p>

          <p>Of all the impudence!</p>

          <p>What did you expect to do...just stride in here and start mixing reagents together until something went bang or made an interesting smell?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No messing around with Alchemy until you've got some training!</p>
