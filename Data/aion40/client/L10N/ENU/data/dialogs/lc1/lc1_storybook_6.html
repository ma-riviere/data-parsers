          <p> Studies on Balaur Ruins Vol. 2: The Altar of the Crimson Dragon</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As before, I express my most sincere gratitude to the Artisan Associates of Sanctum for sponsoring this excavation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the Balaur ruins are some of the best-preserved of ancient Atreian sites (due to their continued use by Sapiens as places of worship), they present a wonderful opportunity to study pre-Cataclysm culture.</p>

          <p> 1. Overview</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Altar of the Crimson Dragon is located in a deep valley in the Southern Tolbas Forest of Verteron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The waterfall that it sits under has eroded much of the temple exterior, but the interior altar remains intact. Made of large slabs of stone, it appears to be devoted to the Dragon Lord Meslamtaeda. The stone it is made of are not native to the area, and must have been transported over a great distance.</p>

        <p>Offerings of apparent Krall origin litter the altar and suggest continued Krall worship. Though the altar, was thankfully unoccupied when our expedition arrived there, local folk songs and legends make reference to Krall at the temple. See the appendix.</p>

          <p> 2. The Altar of the Crimson Dragon and the Tursin Krall</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Altar proves a close former relationship between the Balaur and Tursin Krall. By presenting themselves as gods, the Dragon Lords established power over the Sapiens. The Krall worshipped Meslamtaeda as the "Lord of Death and Fear," offering regular sacrifices to appease him. </p>

          <p>After the Balaur's defeat in the Millennium War, the Sapiens lost a great deal of territory to Human advances. The Tursin were driven out of the region around the Altar and came to reside in what is today the Tursin Garrison.</p>

          <p> 3. The Structure and Style of the Altar</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Altar of the Crimson Dragon is a mix of two different architectural styles. Though it is decorated with the distinctive horn, snake, and chain patterns of the Balaur, these are rendered in the crude fashion of the Krall. It lacks the gold and ivory decorations that characterize Balaur architecture of this period.</p>

          <p> 4. Stone Jar and Unearthed Documents</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A stone jar found under the altar stone contained a brittle book made of leather. I have translated parts of it from the Krall language, and it appears to be a book of rituals. Blood sacrifice features prominently, although it is not clear if Krall or animals were sacrificed. Most intriguing: incomprehensible hieroglyphic characters are found at various points in the book. Whether they are an older Krall or Balaur language I cannot say at this time.</p>

          <p>Also in the jar were bead necklaces and iron rings that date back to before the Cataclysm. The lack of wear on these pieces indicates that they were made only for use as ritual offerings. It is with some amusement I note that the jewelry is crafted to Krall scale; a "ring" for them would serve as a necklace for us.</p>

          <p> 5. Meaning of Inscribed Letters</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The letters inscribed on the altar stone and decorative walls could not be deciphered. Unfortunately, age and water had worn them down enough to make transcription perhaps impossible. They are not known Krall or Balaur alphabets. They may match the hieroglyphics found in the leather book, but the worn state of the letters on the walls makes it tough to say for certain. Conjecture holds that they were chants for use in religious rites.</p>

          <p> 6. Remaining Questions</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are various indications that the Altar once held a statue of Meslamtaeda. However, that statue is nowhere to be found. It may have been moved by Krall to continue their worship of Meslamtaeda, or it may have simply been stolen by Human looters. The fate of the statue, if it existed, will be a good subject for future scholars.</p>
