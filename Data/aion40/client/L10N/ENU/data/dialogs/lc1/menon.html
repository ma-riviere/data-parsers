          <p>Hmm. There's a halo of Aether around you like I've never seen before. You're no ordinary Daeva, that's for sure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lean closer, and I'll tell you something that the ordinary Daevas don't know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just between you and me, Benorun and Deke are crooks. All they think about is how they can cheat Elyos who've just stepped off the boat.</p>

          <p>No problem. Stay away from those crooks.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're pretty perceptive, though--you probably would have seen right through those guys. Someone as perceptive as you is probably on the lookout for moneymaking opportunities.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I happen to have a little something I can cut you in on, actually. How much money did you say you were carrying...?</p>
