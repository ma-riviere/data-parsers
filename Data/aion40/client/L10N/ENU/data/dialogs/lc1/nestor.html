          <p>Greetings!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's a bright, young Daeva like you doing in a gloomy, old place like this? Shouldn't you be out in the fresh air?</p>

        <body>
          <p>Have you ever heard the old Elyos saying, "Stone tablets crumble and books decay, but the Daevas never forget"?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you haven't. Well, then. Many people think history books are redundant, since the Daevas are immortal and remember everything clearly. It's not entirely true, is it, though?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Books can teach you a lot. Sometimes, they can even be more reliable than Daevas who had been present. Let's not pretend that no Daeva has ever lied, or twisted the truth to suit their own purposes.</p>

          <p>Every aspect of Atreian history I can find.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The emergence of the Balaur, the Cataclysm, the nature of Aether, the sundering of the Tower...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>...and what the Humans of each epoch thought and felt about it. The history of the Elyos isn't just the history of Daevas.</p>
