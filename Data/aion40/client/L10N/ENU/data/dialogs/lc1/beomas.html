          <p>Oh...I am so full. Have you sampled the fare here? It's beyond excellent! The chefs are famous throughout Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I've had too much of a good thing. It was that last pastry that did it. Oh...but it was so perfectly baked, elegantly decorated...how could any Daeva resist a thing of such beauty and extraordinary taste?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May the Blessed Five Seraphim Lords shed their light forever on the cook who made that pastry!</p>
