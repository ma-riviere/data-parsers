          <p>Daeva's Day began soon after the first Daevas ascended to save Atreia from the Balaur. Everyone gathered to celebrate each ascension...each new Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As more people ascended to become Daevas, it became difficult to congratulate them individually. Part of Daeva's Day now is about congratulating all the year's new Daevas and thanking Daevas young and old for their service to Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Light's blessings to you, [%username], protector of Elysea!</p>
