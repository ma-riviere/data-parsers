          <p>Stigma stones are not just pretty crystals. Each one encases the power and spirit of an ancestral Daeva who vanished during an epic battle at the Abyss, long ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To use a Stigma Stone is to honor the ancestors' will. Through us, they fight on, even though their bodies are long lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is my solemn duty to aid them in this process.</p>

          <p>[%username], I regret I cannot help you to use Stigma Stones at this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do not despair. Continue to hone your abilities as a Daeva, and one day the mysteries of the Stigma Stones will be revealed to you. When that time comes, return to me and we shall speak again.</p>
