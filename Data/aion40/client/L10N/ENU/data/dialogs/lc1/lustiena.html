          <p>Have a look over that edge. It's a big drop, isn't it? That never used to be a problem. Sanctum was intended for Daevas and Daevas alone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But ever since Daevas in Sanctum started employing Humans, we've had no end of problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I keep warning the Humans. Don't act recklessly in Sanctum, don't get falling-down drunk in the Dionysia Tavern, and above all take special caution near the ledge, but accidents still occur every now and then.</p>

          <p>Absolutely. You're exactly right. So, I started patrolling dangerous spots to protect them. I've lost count of how many of them I've caught.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not a bad life. The ground below is beautiful to look at, and like you say, protecting Humans is a sacred duty of all true Daevas.</p>
