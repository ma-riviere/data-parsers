          <p>I hope you don't mind if I keep working while we talk. Sanctum's gardens don't tend themselves. These blue seraphim need lots of water.</p>

          <p>Hether says the Eltnen sunflowers are her favorites. They don't grow in Eltnen anymore, you know. I love them all--even the pink bunkadoos, though I'm not fond of their smell.</p>

          <p>If you ever grow weary of battle, spend some time tending flowers. It's a wonderful way to restore your spirit.</p>
