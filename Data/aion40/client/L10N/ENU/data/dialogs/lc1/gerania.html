          <p>Welcome! Do you need a document restored? That's what I do mostly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I love this work--it's fascinating. I wish I could explain the thrill of watching lost texts come back to life under your fingers.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's so much missing from history...so much we still don't know. Ancient languages, coded messages--I've done this for years and it still excites me.</p>
