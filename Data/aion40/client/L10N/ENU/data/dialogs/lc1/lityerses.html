          <p>Daevas. Pah. You're all starry-eyed idiots with your heads in the clouds. None of you know what the real world is like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Guess what, pretty one. Not all parts of Sanctum are sweetness and light. You don't belong here. You'd better run along, back to the Divine Road.</p>

          <p>The Dionysia? Wait...you've been talking to that stupid wench Ludina, haven't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've warned her not to follow me around, but she doesn't take the hint. I guess I'll have to be more persuasive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I trust you'll be more sensible. Walk away, Daeva.</p>
