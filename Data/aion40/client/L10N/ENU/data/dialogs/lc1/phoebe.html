          <p>One day I may have missions for you, [%username], but I cannot send you into the Abyss yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's no place for an novice Daeva. No insult to your courage, but bravery alone goes only so far. There are dangers in the Abyss that require tremendous skill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take heart. When you have learned enough to come before me, everyone will know you've earned the honor.</p>
