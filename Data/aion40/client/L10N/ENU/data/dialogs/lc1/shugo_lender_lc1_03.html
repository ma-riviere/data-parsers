          <p>Welcome, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kalipyerk has everything you need at lowest prices in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about latest shields? These all very well-priced, made without using any Balaur material.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva! You say you want old, Balic shields? Say you hear about time-limit to rent non-Balaur pieces?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have been tricked! Time-limit, yes, but much more effective than nasty old stuff and renew with Kalipyerk any time. Come, take a look.</p>
