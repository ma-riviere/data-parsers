          <p>May Lady Yustiel, preserver of life and giver of mercy, bless this work, containing knowledge of toxins and venoms unusual and curious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May this work save the lives of many, and may Aion bless the poor afflicted souls whose deaths contributed to this research.</p>

          <p> Yormunad's Venom</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The creature commonly known as the "Yormunad" produces a deadly toxin from its bite. Death is silent and instant, as though the victim were struck down by Aion himself. It is impossible to employ an antidote, as the smallest dosage kills instantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Certain Shugo traders extract the venom from the Yormunad's fangs, selling it to unscrupulous individuals. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though possession and sale are prosecuted with the most severe punishments imaginable, this black trade seems likely to continue as long as people seek to kill one another.</p>

          <p> Moonflower Root</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The root of the Moonflower may be dried, then crushed or ground into a fine red powder. A dosage of a finger or more, taken into the lungs or stomach, results in high fever, a growing shortness of breath, and eventual death by suffocation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Upon examination, the victim's lungs will reveal discoloration of a similar color to the root powder, leaving no question as to the cause of death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The poison may be reliably neutralized with a compound of Odella and spores from a Moonflower spore pouch--a case where the problem is also the solution.</p>

          <p> Wriggot's Anger</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The body fluid of Wriggots, combined with a small quantity of Tripeed Sap, will produce a powerful hallucinatory drug that can be administered via stomach, lungs, or skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The drug induces vivid nightmares which may cause victims to wander over precipices or into bodies of water while in the grip of their delusions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Certain medicinal teas may calm the victim to a degree, and the effects will pass harmlessly after a few hours. </p>

          <p> Abyssal Curse</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mix Citrin Powder, Volcanic Dust, Elemental Stone Powder, and Abyss Shards in a precise ratio of 1:2:1:1/2. Add Elemental Water to the mixed powder, then boil until  crystallization occurs. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The resulting substance, ground again into a powder, is deleterious if introduced into the lungs. It binds with lung tissues, and--if a sufficient quantity is taken over time--will eventually stop the victim's breathing.</p>
          <p> </p>
         
          <p>Washing out the respiratory tract with Greater Elemental Water may alleviate the symptoms, but unless the influx of poison is stopped, the victim will eventually die.</p>
