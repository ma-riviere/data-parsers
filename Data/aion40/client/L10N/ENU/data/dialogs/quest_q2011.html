          <p>I understand you just got your wings. So let's put them to use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Altgard Fortress is a big place. You should probably learn your way around--from the air.</p>

          <p>Fly around? Yes, although your new wings won't keep you aloft for long...yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you really want a good look at Altgard Fortress, you should fly up to Borender.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He watches for aerial threats from the slopes of that floating rock above the fortress--the one with the Abyss portal embedded in it. Tell Borender I sent you, and he'll point out the important landmarks.</p>

          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Blender] near the top of that floating rock up there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Make sure you don't let your wings get too tired. If you start falling, just unfurl your wings shortly before you hit the ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You wouldn't want to leave a crater, would you? Now go fly up to Borender!</p>

          <p>Welcome to Altgard, [%username]. I hope you're tougher than the usual recruit, or Suthran will make your immortal life miserable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One way you can get on his good side: eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_13] as it floats out of the portal. High Priest Thrud says that the fungen will release spores if it floats near another fungen--and those spores make Humans and Daevas deathly ill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to get rid of those pests before that happens.</p>

        	<p>You should be saying, "How do I do that, sir?" But I'm not as spit-and-polish as most folks here.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to fly out to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_13] and attack them--blade, bow, magic, whatever. Any attack will do.</p>
          <p> </p>
		  <p>Report to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Valuerin] when you're done. And don't leave a crater in the snow because you flew too long, eh?</p>

          <p>Excellent. Most recruits could use some aerial combat practice.</p>

          <p>Killing fungens isn't glamorous, but few of our tasks are. Get used to that, and you'll do fine here in Altgard.</p>
