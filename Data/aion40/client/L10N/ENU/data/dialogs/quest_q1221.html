          <p>What a headache!</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>We received a report that there are weird Krall appearing in Cantas Coast. They look exactly like Tursin Krall, but act quite strangely.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>These Krall--even all amputated and bloody--have been attacking Lepharist Revolutionaries, and they keep on fighting way past when they'd normally give up, like they were under some kind of spell.</p>

          <p>According to the report, this looks like the work of an Asmodian named Hamerun. We don't know how he brainwashed these Krall, but we can't just sit here and watch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't even want to imagine what would happen if these Krall begin attacking the Verteron Aetheric Field Observatory. We must stop them before such a disaster occurs.</p>     
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you help us out, [%username], we can surely take care of this right away. Will you?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Considering the brainwashed Tursin Krall are appearing in Cantas Coast, the entrance to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDNovice_SZ_IDNovice]--where Hamerun is no doubt hiding--should be near there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you manage to enter Haramel, terminate [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_07_TKrallWa_prion_18_an]s with all possible haste.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sooner we can keep those brainwashed Krall away from Cantas Coast, the better.</p>

          <p>Krall and Sapiens together? This Hamerun is more dangerous than I expected. We'll have to investigate further.</p>  
          <p> </p>
          <p>At any rate, it's a relief you terminated all of the Tursin Outpost Guards.</p>

          <p>Hyacinte said the Tursin Krall have been attacking the Lepharist Revolutionaries in Cantas Coast and mentioned that an Asmodian named Hamerun was behind the attacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was worried that the Krall might attack Verteron Aetheric Field Observatory. He asked you to kill the Tursin Outpost Guards in Haramel to slow them down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You did as you were asked, killing the Tursin Krall before returning for a reward.</p>
