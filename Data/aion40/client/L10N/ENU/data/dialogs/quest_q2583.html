          <p>Indeed! They include Grankers and Tricos. Truly remarkable creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, I have something important to ask their leaders. If you see them, would you mind relaying a message?</p>

          <p>The message is this: As courteously as you can, ask if they would share their wisdom and power in the event that the Beluslan Fortress is ever in trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>That's all. Just deliver my words. The choice of whether or not to help is theirs. No matter the answer, we are Asmodians, and will gain strength from the challenges ahead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The leader of the Grankers is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vanargand], and that of the Tricos is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hreidmar]. Good luck!</p>
