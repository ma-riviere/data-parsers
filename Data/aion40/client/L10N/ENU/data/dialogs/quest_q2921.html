          <p>Have you ever been to a party in Vanahal? You might get an invitation, but me? Ha! They're particular about who they let in. So my friends and I--we sneak in when we can. Those rich people sure know how to party. They have the finest food, the finest drinks...the finest women.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's where I saw her.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Sadena]...just saying her name makes me...all...I don't know how to describe it.  She's so refined, so proud, and so self-assured--not like most of the insecure girls I usually meet. I can't get her out of my mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My friends tell me I'm crazy. I should forget about her--she's out of my league. But how can I? Her fine features, her fine clothes, her fine figure. I can't get her out of my mind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I musta stared at her all night long. I don't even know if she noticed me.</p>

          <p>I can't just ask her out, I'm sure she gets hundreds of dates from those Vanahal boys. I'll have to impress her. But...I'm not like her. I can't possibly impress her...unless...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only way I can impress her is to know what impresses her. If I got advice from Sadena's friends, maybe I could find a way to impress her. But I can't ask them--they won't even give me the time of day, let alone Sadena's favorite color.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you go talk to them, [%username]? Just ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dune], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Araison], and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lidorasa] about her and give me something to work with?</p>

          <p>I've seen her at the theater with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dune], so she will know what makes her laugh. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Araison] is her favorite poet, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lidorasa] usually goes shopping with Sadena. If those three don't know what she likes then nobody does.</p>

          <p>Oh, you just gave me a moment's reprieve. I'm on my way to meet up with Sadena. She's perhaps the most opinionated woman in all of Pandaemonium. She can be pretty harsh on people if they're not up to her standards.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No one I know can stand to spend more than a few minutes with her. She's has expensive taste, but sometimes comments a bit harshly--especially on others' taste in clothing, jewelry, and interior decoration.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last week, she made Selesti break down in tears. Sadena thought the decorations in the Banquet Hall were rustic, and said "This looks like what the Apellbine Tavern throws out of the latrine after a holiday weekend." </p>

          <p>The only thing I've seen move her is honesty. As you can tell, she can be brutally honest. People who lie and cajole to try and get something out of her. That just drives her crazy. And fashion is just opinion really, but truth...well...she can't argue with the truth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess that's why she's my friend in spite of her faults.</p>
