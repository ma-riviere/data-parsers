          <p>I do most of the scouting missions around the Lepharist Research Center. I wish Aiokina could help me, but she's too tired.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm tired as well, but what can I do? We should take care of each other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah well. If I go scouting, I can practice against the Lepharists.</p>

          <p>These days, scouting is hard. The Lepharists trained and released dozens of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Pretor_40_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Kuillus_40_An]s to protect the Lepharist Research Center.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're more sensitive than Humans and can sense even the smallest noise. I've nearly been caught several times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you'd have better luck. Would you mind going to the Research Center and thinning out the Pretors and Kirrins? It would be a big help.</p>

          <p>There are quite a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Pretor_40_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Kuillus_40_An]s around the Lepharist Research Center.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're annoying, but they should be no problem for someone of your skill.</p>
