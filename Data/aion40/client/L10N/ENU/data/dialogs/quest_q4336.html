          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. It's getting cold out here again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I really need to speak with one of my union officials about moving this Morheim branch office of the Manastone Removers Association...indoors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you looking for some contract work? I need HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones for an order today...10 of each. The reward is a nice one....</p>

          <p>The shadows are on my side today, Daeva! Great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But remember what I told you, 10 of each of the HP +40, Accuracy +16, and Block +16 manastones. No less, or the deal is off. You might even have them in your warehouse.</p>
