          <p>It was just before the Cataclysm. The Balaur launched a fierce assault on the village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even the Red Sky Legion couldn't stop them...they killed everybody. My family, my friends, all dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was sure I was dead, too. But when I opened my eyes again, I found myself still here beneath Baltasar, glorious wings now growing from my back.</p>

          <p>Baltasar tells me not to bear a grudge, but I still hate the Balaur. How could I not?</p>

          <p>They survive to this day. The corruption spread to them like everything else.</p>

          <p>Would you slaughter the undead Balaur? It'd put my mind at ease knowing those fiends walk no longer.</p>
