          <p>We've tried for so long to understand why the Balaur take our possessions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Initially we assumed they took the items that appeared to be of value, and based that assumption on the fact that most of the items were made of gold. But then we discovered the treasures at the Sulfur Tree Nest, which put us right back at square one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All we know for certain is that the Balaur are very interested in taking our treasures and artifacts. Now we just need to know why.</p>

          <p>Hah! Your words betray your training--you're a soldier, not a scholar.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, you do speak some semblance of sense. Perhaps we should send you to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Divine_SZ_All], and see what results you achieve through brute force.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, the Balaur still need killing. Perhaps killing those particular fiends will grant us new information. What do you say?</p>

          <p>Good. Hopefully your work will yield results but, even if not, we will have removed a large number of Balaur from the region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No doubt your skills will improve too, [%userclass]. A Daeva of your standing must be tested against the best our enemies have to offer, and in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAbRe_Low_Divine_SZ_All] I believe you'll find your match.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Hah! So you suggest combat, but when it is you who is offered the chance to fight, you say no?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], we cannot fight only the Asmodians. Ignoring the Balaur only allows their numbers to grow, and in numbers the Balaur find their confidence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember that. We must fight two wars at once. Neither enemy can be ignored, even for a moment.</p>

          <p>Excellent work!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And did you learn from the experience? What I find so fascinating is the differences in style and approach that the various Balaur creatures employ. They're smart and they rely on more than sheer brute strength.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's a small reward for your efforts. Good stuff!</p>
