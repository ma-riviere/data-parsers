          <p>They called me "Skurv" because I was short and fat. I was the laughingstock of my village. Even my family--my flesh and blood--pitied me! Nobody encouraged me or even scolded me. Nobody took me in, taught me to be a true Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was a considered a half-man. I was Skurv. So what did I do?</p>

          <p>No. What kind of person do you think I am? I left, to prove them all wrong. I took a bit of food and clothing and set up here, among the Skurvs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They soon came to trust me and now I am the pack's alpha male. I trust them, too. I have family.</p>

          <p>It's not enough, though. I must still prove to the villagers that I'm strong and able.</p>

          <p>I'll take back the Lava Caves of Taran for Asmodae. They teem with Klaws. The townsfolk have abandoned them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine what they'd say if I cleared them! How stupid they'd feel! I'd have respect. "Skurv" would die, and the name "Kimssi" would mean something!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's just one problem. I can't beat all the Klaws alone, or even with my friends here. I need help, [%username], from someone like you with powerful allies.</p>
