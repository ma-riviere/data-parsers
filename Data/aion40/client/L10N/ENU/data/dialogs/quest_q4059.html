          <p>Thanks to you, [%username], the Petrahulk problem was solved. But I still have one more problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All the samples from the Peckus I'd already collected are useless! I did have some in storage, but something has contaminated all of them.</p>

          <p>I'm looking into that, but it's gong to take some time to investigate--time I don't have because I need to collect fresh samples. Augh! There's just not enough time!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please [%username], can I ask for your help again?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CockatriceNBlueD_48_An]s and collect fresh samples while I deal with the storage here?</p>

          <p>Collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4059a]s. Their hollow shafts are permeable and show clearly how much contamination is in the area. But since they are permeable, only those recently pulled have accurate data.</p>
         <p> </p>
          <p>You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CockatriceNBlueD_48_An]s along cliffs near The Coastal Pass.</p>

          <p>Time is critical, so please bring them fast.</p>

          <p>Brusthonin is so inhospitable, it's tough to believe it was once the breadbasket of Atreia. It'll be so rewarding once the contamination here is completely purified.</p>
