          <p>Commander Suthran thinks that we're reacting to whatever the Mau do, and that's a recipe for weakness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's ordered us to seize the initiative--to attack them at their strongest point and force them to react to us for a change.</p>

          <p>Ideally we'd pit our strength against their weakness, [%username]--that's been our military doctrine, straight from Azphel himself, since the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But in this case a surprise attack should render their strength irrelevant.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their sentries will spot a mass attack long before it arrives. But a small group--or even a single Daeva--could catch them off guard.</p>

          <p>Approach quietly, Daeva--the Mau have keen ears.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Dellalont] said he would send a [%userclass] capable of a sneak attack on the Mau. I'm guessing that's you.</p>

          <p>If you're cautious and focused, you should be able to pick off the Mau one or two at a time. But get overeager or careless, and they'll overwhelm you.</p>

          <p>Go back to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_20] and take out [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LycanShamanSNamed_19_Ae]. She is a shaman so powerful she essentially multiplies the Mau we face on the battlefield.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If her spirit is too tough to break, then there is another way, my kin. She has a successor, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF1A_LycanShamanNamedQ_19_An]. One day he'll be as strong...or perhaps stronger than Abija, but for now his powers are still being nurtured. Kill him, and you'll do us all a great favor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not asking you to kill both, [%username]. Pick one, take your allies and bury them, then return to me with one of their staves. Blood for blood.</p>

          <p>I had my doubts that we'd actually succeed, but I figured a credible attempt would be disruptive to the Mau and thus advantageous for us, even if High Spellshifter Abija escaped.</p>
