          <p>You found a jewelry box abandoned near Lodas. He suggested it might belong to Justachys, a Guardian Sentinel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you took the pendant to Justachys. It soon emerged that the pendant was entrusted to him by a good friend who had been killed, and Justachys now had to take it to his friend's son. He had lost the box walking through the desert.</p>
