          <p>Now that I have my father's shoe, I can finally meet him with some purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is a little bit of a problem still...like that Noiyus said. I don't have much Kinah on me. I spent more than I bargained for just trying to get here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be honest with you, young Daeva, I had to borrow from some people along the way...some rather unfriendly people.</p>

          <p>Oh dear, can you imagine what my father will say when I show up on his doorstep after eighty years and ask to borrow Kinah?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He'll despise me, young Daeva. I can't meet him with this debt hanging over me.</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you! Thank you! I have a plan that may get me out of this trouble...if you'll help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1692]s near the fortress. I don't need much...maybe ten should be enough to pay off my debt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And.... I hate to be a bother, young Daeva, but I could use a few more Kinah to get me to Sanctum.... Maybe buy myself a little something to eat along the way.</p>
