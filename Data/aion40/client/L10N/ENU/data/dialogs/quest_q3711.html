          <p>The Protector of Teminon Legion has devised a plan--a special mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This mission could change the political landscape of Reshanta. All we need now is a well-qualified person to carry it out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You came to my mind, and just as I was going to go look for you, here you are!</p>

          <p>Infiltrate the Dredgion. No, hear me out....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>An attack from inside has a much greater chance of success than our fruitless attacks from the outside. The interior has no special defense system--a small infiltration force would only face a handful of normal Balaur. Even the Dredgion Airborne Soldiers aren't enchanted while inside. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A great many Elyos sacrificed their lives to get this information. Can you handle the job?</p>

          <p>Dredgion has been our worst nightmare. We can't attack it directly because of its massive weaponry.</p>

          <p>We capture a fortress, and all too often Dredgion arrives to take it back again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now...now we know how to infiltrate the deepest levels of Dredgion. Now we have a new way to fight them.</p>

          <p>I don't have a lot of specifics at the moment. When you're ready, look for Special Administration Officer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Asellus], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pelasgus] in the Teminon Wharf, or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Hippotades] in Teminon's Leap. </p>
           <p> </p>
          <p>Any of them can get you inside, but only when the Dredgion gets close. So first, ask if it's the proper time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you're inside, get familiar with the layout, then find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_DrakanBoss_50_Ah] and eliminate him. If they lose the captain, they'll be stopped in their tracks. That'll keep our fortresses from being targeted.</p>
