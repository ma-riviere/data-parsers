          <p>Look, these batches of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2115b] need to be delivered to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Denma]. She runs the general store at the Anturoon Crossing and has been pestering me for the supplies.</p>

          <p>Greetings, raider. I assume you are [%username], the one Dalor said would be delivering my leather supplies?</p>

          <p>This is all of it?</p>

          <p>I asked for as much leather as possible, and when he eventually gets around to supplying me, this is what I get? Who decided Dalor would be our sole leather supplier, anyway?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, I suppose there's no reason to shoot the delivery person. Here is the money I promised; at least I will hold up my end of our deal.</p>
