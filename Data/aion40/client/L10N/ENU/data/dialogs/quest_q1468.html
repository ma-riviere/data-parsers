          <p>I once knew a Daeva...a man, a boy...[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Denlavis]. We grew up together. As children, we dreamed of ascending, of serving the light as partners. But Ariel had other plans for us. Denlavis ascended. I did not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he was first dispatched as a Guardian, he wrote and visited me when he could. But those  stopped. I haven't heard from him since.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I fear he was sent to the Abyss. I've asked passing Daevas for information, but I've had no way to search for him. Before I die, I need to discover his fate. Will you help me?</p>

          <p>A Daeva named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phorcys] was posted to the same unit. She's stationed at [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA21_1] now.</p>

          <p>Ah, Denlavis! A fine fighter, fierce as a Naga! But...he disappeared decades ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were in the Bloody Mist Legion together. Denlavis and I went with our unit through a Rift to Asmodae. We found a place called Morheim and discovered the Fire Temple, a sanctuary filled with jewels and valuables as big as a mountain!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A beautiful woman appeared--beautiful and terrible as the Empyrean Lords, she was. She nearly caught us. I don't know who she was but I'll never forget her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We grabbed some trinkets, then slipped away before she noticed us. Once we'd made our escape, we realized that Denlavis wasn't with us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That was the last I saw of him. I was transferred to the Golden Bough Legion soon after. Rumor was Denlavis was killed by that woman. No one knows for sure, though....</p>
