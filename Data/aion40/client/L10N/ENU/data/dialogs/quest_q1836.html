	<p>Ancient Crowns are my business. If you have one, hand it to me and I'll reward you for your troubles with Abyss Points.</p>

	<p>Ah yes, so you do.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These are the lowest grade of Ancient Crowns that Sanctum is willing to accept. I'm sure you can see why--it's nearly impossible to tell that it was once a crown.</p>

	<p>Ah yes, thank you for bringing me this! The condition could certainly be better, but I'd sooner have our treasures in our possession than the Balaur's.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These Crowns were worn by Priests, you know. They were mostly for formal ceremonies, weddings and the like, and were worn to symbolize the union between the couple and the Empyrean Lords. Fascinating stuff.</p>

	<p>It is indeed! And what a sample!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Bringing these treasures back is a responsibility that many Daevas shirk. Perhaps they do not appreciate the lessons we can still be taught by our ancestors. Perhaps they simply do not understand.</p>

	<p>Well...yes, yes it is!</p>

	<p>Only the most perfectly preserved Ancient Crowns are afforded this status, and it's a rare day indeed that someone like me is afforded the chance to hold one! What a beautiful sample!</p>

	<p>What? You may well have a Crown to hand in, but...look at you! Don't try and tell me you're capable of surviving the Balaur Treasury!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I can't accept any relics from individuals unless they collected the relic themselves. The last thing we want to do is create an artificial market for the trading of relics, when we need to research them as soon as they're found.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>You should leave.</p>
