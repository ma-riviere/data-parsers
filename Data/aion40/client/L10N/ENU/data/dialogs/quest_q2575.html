          <p>Those Frost Agrints are getting bolder every day. Last night I was standing sentry by myself, as Baugi was ill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I suddenly felt...you know...nature's call. I went behind that rock over there, and suddenly I felt a chill from...behind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I turned around and there was this huge monster lumbering toward me!</p>

          <p>No! It's not a joke! You wouldn't think it was funny if it were you! I mean...if Daevas still have to...anyway, I was so shocked that I barely managed to pull up my pants and flee back to the guardpost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean look around. They're all over the place and they wander practically right up to the perimeter. They're not scared at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you think you could put the fear of Azphel into those  [%dic:STR_DIC_M_AgrintIceD_38_An]s, Daeva?</p>

          <p>Ocho said he was surprised by a Frost Agrint as he answered nature's call last night. The creatures are coming closer than ever. He asked you to kill some of them to make them stay back farther.</p>

          <p>When you eradicated the Frost Agrints in the area, he was very grateful.</p>
