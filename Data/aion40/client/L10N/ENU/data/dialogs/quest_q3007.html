          <p>I guess I am really lucky to work in a place like this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not many people come and go around here, either because it's an isolated area, or because there are more Shugos than Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, I have plenty of free time to write.</p>

          <p>Nothing a Daeva like you has ever heard of, I'm sure.</p>

          <p>But since you asked, I compile legends into a record called "The Nymph in Folklore"</p>

          <p>Stories like the love of a woodcutter for a forest spirit, that sort of thing.</p>

          <p>Well, that's surprising! As far as I knew, only the head librarian at Sanctum and his son have ever shown an interest in my work. I still have so much to learn as a writer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I practice whenever I have time, but the pens cost so much! I use one a day, and it really adds up. I guess I could get the materials myself, but my post here is too important to leave, even for a short time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Say, You've read my work--would you like to sponsor me?</p>

          <p>It would really mean a lot, and wouldn't be all that hard. All I need are a few [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3007a]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The feathers of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Harpy_23_An] hold up the best. Sometimes I can go two days with one of those.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're a bit violent, but I have a feeling that a seasoned [%userclass] like you can handle them easily.</p>

          <p>I probably chose the wrong word, again. When I said sponsorship, you may have thought financial support. I'm just asking to "borrow" your abilities for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All I want is to for you to swat a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Harpy_23_An]s and get some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3007a]s for me...</p>

          <p>Wow, this is great! Not only prettier, but much stronger than the ones I buy from Shugos.</p>

          <p>This will do nicely. Now how do you spell [%username] again? I'll write a poem about you!</p>
