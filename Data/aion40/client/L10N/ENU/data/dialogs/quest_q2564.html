          <p>We've tried a number of different ways to produce a more effective Magic Flame Ward, and while it's not perfect, I've recently come up with one that works better than what we've been using.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to start using this scroll immediately here, but I need it delivered to the Daevas of Flame around Kurngalfberg for their use as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing to deliver this for me?</p>
