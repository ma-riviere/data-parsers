          <p>When they asked me to come here, I thought, "Sure, what a great vacation! I hear it's beautiful in Beluslan, and I'll get to study the ancient architecture besides."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've been so busy managing this repair project I haven't even had the time to go relax in the snow. Not even for a minute!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose if I can fix this place up I'll be pretty famous, though, so it's not like I won't get anything out of it.</p>
