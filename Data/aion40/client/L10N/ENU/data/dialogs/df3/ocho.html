          <p>So, I'm a Watch member.... I'm not a professional but with things as they are, lots of people are new to the Watch.</p>

          <p>I can't swing a stick well, but I'll man the gate as well as I can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of us have never studied swordsmanship or fighting arts, but at least we have Vonduca. So things will be okay, we hope.</p>

          <p>She's the Captain of our Watch. Vonduca's not a professional soldier either, but she's a strong leader. People listen to her and trust her orders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's thanks to her that so many of us escaped to this camp instead of being killed in the village by the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She organized the evacuation, and I figure she can cope with whatever new emergencies come up.</p>
