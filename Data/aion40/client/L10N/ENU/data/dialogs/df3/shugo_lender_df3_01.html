          <p>So you are armed with a [%mainslotitem], huh? You sure it is strong enough? Many tough foes out there, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to be secure in battle, buy one of my Mist weapons! They may be made of mist, but they are solid as metal! More solid, even!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have to warn you, though: they do become mist again after certain time, float away. But you will still have mighty weapon for quite a while! So how about it, Daeva?</p>
