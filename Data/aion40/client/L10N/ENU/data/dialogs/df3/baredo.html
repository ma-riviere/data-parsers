          <p>It makes me so furious. Here we are, consigned to a harsh life in darkness while the Elyos enjoy comfort and light. As much as I hate the Elyos, I know whose fault this is--the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is all because of the Cataclysm they caused.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must have revenge on those monsters. As Centurion Sleipnir says, we should drive the Balaur from all of Atreia and the Abyss!</p>
