          <p>Some people think that anyone with a loud voice can become an information officer. It's true that some information officers have loud voices--and little else to recommend them for the job. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As an information officer, you should know whether the information you announce is true, or whose opinion you're representing.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Accurate information is vital when delivering the news from Pandaemonium or the current status in the Abyss.</p>
