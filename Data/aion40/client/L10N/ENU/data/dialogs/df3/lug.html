          <p>The Manastone Removers Association recommends replacing your old manastones regularly. Old manastones can cause accidents and even grievous injuries or death.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get a new manastone, have the old one replaced right away. And for your own safety, only use professional labor certified by the Manastone Removers Association.</p>
