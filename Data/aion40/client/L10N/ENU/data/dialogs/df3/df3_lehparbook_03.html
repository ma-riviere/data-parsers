          <p>Confession of a Lepharist: Lord Lephar and New Life</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My heart is filled with emotion as I witness Lephar's wonder for my comrades. I'll tell you of my shameful past with courage. I will confess my sins openly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was born to an affluent Daeva family, but I didn't have a happy childhood. My parents always compared me with my brother, both in appearance and ability. My brother and I ascended almost at the same moment, but that only made matters worse. We trained in the Temple together, and the differences in our abilities increased.</p>

          <p>Instructors always made me feel miserable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would have rejoiced to hear them speak of my excellent brother. But instead they talked about me behind my back. When I managed to graduate from the Temple, my brother was already a famous Archon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I bought better weapons and more expensive clothes to disguise my inferiority. It was like pouring water into a bottomless well. Even if I worked harder, I couldn't catch up with my brother.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So I began to spend more and more time at the tavern to forget about him.</p>

          <p>One day I was so drunk that I attacked a Daeva, unfortunately she happened to be from Vanahal. So, I was punished several times harsher than I deserved, and labored shamefully at a workhouse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My parents had prepared a job for me after I served my time. It was a Legion Warehouse Manager position. My mother blamed herself and begged me to take the job. I did so because I couldn't hurt her feelings, but I  felt miserable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And one day I was so melancholy that I decided to go to the Great Temple to pray. On the way I met a Daeva of Fortunetelling. He said to me. "This is not a place you belong to. Go out into the world and find your true way."</p>

          <p>When I heard that, I felt like something struck me. So I packed immediately and left Pandaemonium. I first went to Ishalgen without any definite plans. I'd never been there, but one of my close friends from the Temple resided there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first I felt free and easy. I'd left Pandaemonium where I'd been born and lived my whole life. I saw so many poor, unhappy people everywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But before long I was robbed of every Kinah I had. I wandered aimlessly for a time, and then I met a gatherer who was willing to help me.</p>

          <p>What I realized at that time was that poor people understand each other's difficulties. You know, Daevas wouldn't give me a Kinah. Instead, they pointed fingers at me and said cruel things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I could not live in my new friend's house forever. I knew he made a meager living as a gatherer.... So I gathered a few valuable herbs using my rather clumsy skills. I left the herbs in his house as a gift when I departed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went to the Abyss in desperation. You can guess how dangerous it was for me, a weakling as Daevas go, to go to the Abyss, alone! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For a time, I laid low and scrabbled just to survive. When think of it now, I feel quite ashamed. But I could not help it...I had no courage to fight against Balaur or Elyos, and moreover, my flying skill wasn't up to the task.</p>

          <p>Then one day I got into big trouble. I was so exhausted from hunger and lack of rest, I fell asleep on the road.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I woke up and found that I was in a magic trap surrounded by Draconutes. I despaired for my life, but honestly, I was so tired of the misery of life, I hadn't the strength to put up a fight. It was at that moment Lord Lephar appeared. He drove away the Draconutes, and saved me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I had been taken by the Draconutes, what would have happened to me? I still shudder at the thought.</p>

          <p>Lord Lephar helped me without questions. It still brings a tear to my eye when I think of his magnanimity in that time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The kindness that Lord Lephar showed to me was warmer than that of my own family. It was the warmest reception I'd ever experienced. But that was not all. Every word Lord Lephar said touched me deep in my heart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Especially the dream that everyone, including me, could become a perfect Human. It was like everything that weighed on my mind for so long just flew away and I was free at last.</p>

          <p>When I entered the Lepharist recruit training center, my comrades taught me everything I needed to know. Training was hard, but I could feel the strength growing in me, slowly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was reborn as a Lepharist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once I had confidence, I could do anything. I wanted to share the happiness I had experienced--that transformed me--with other unfortunate people.</p>

          <p>I spoke of this idea to Lord Lephar. He gave me a mission immediately. He did not doubt me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The mission was to disguise myself as a pilgrim, enter the Hidden Library in Pandaemonium, and bring an important book to him. I can say this to you now--I was nearly caught. I was recognized by a drunkard named Matuske. I managed to get out of the predicament only because he was so very drunk--the poor, poor man.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, I completed my first mission safely. I felt such happiness that no single word can describe it. I grew confident that I could carry out any mission on behalf of Lord Lephar.</p>

          <p>You know the rest of the story. I spearheaded several operations including the Tempest Shipyard riot, the robbery of Abyss supplies, and the disappearance of the Shadow Judge. I also helped the Lepharist who stole the Mystic Spring Map of Eltnen to escape.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have used many aliases and accomplished many feats in both Elysea and Asmodae as well as the Abyss. But I try hard not to forget the moment I was saved by Lord Lephar. That was the day I was reborn and given a new purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Today I am happy and content knowing that each mission I complete is another step toward Lord Lephar's dream--and mine--of perfection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope my story has inspired you to help us build a new Atreia. Perfection is our destiny.</p>
