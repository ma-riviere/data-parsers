          <p>It seems it's going to snow soon. The wound on my shoulder hurts. That's how I know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was wounded by a Balaur in the Abyss--that was decades ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I killed that Balaur with one stroke. It was me or him. Unfortunately for him, I chose me.</p>

          <p>I've experienced much, in fact. I've lived long and have been dispatched to many places.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But compared with my experience in the Abyss...well, nothing is like that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With such experience comes wisdom and knowledge. Sometimes I even advise the Brigade General.</p>
