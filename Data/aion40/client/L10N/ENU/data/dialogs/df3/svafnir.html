          <p>When I studied in Pandaemonium, I majored in Mau. I wrote several well-received articles, in fact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suspect that's why I've received so many missions related to the Mau, but I discovered something out here...</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theory and reality don't always align.</p>

          <p>It's hard for me to think of Mau as more than the subject of study.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>I didn't understand why I was dispatched here, in fact.</P>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To understand the Mau as a scholar is decidedly different than confronting them as a foe...or an ally.</p>
