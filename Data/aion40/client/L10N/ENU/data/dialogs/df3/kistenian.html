          <p>As you get older, you're more inclined to talk about the past. I can feel it coming on--the uncontrollable urge to tell stories. Or maybe it's just my being here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was excited about restoring this frozen place in part because I could help return it to the glory it was in my youth--lively and welcoming, majestic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now? Nothing may come of it. I barely see a difference from when I first arrived. I can't be sure we're making any headway at all.</p>
