          <p>Fog isn't the only thing that leads sailors astray. A beguiling melody, an enchanting aria clouds the mind and dooms many a ship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The song of a Seiren conjures up memories fair and foul, terrible and joyful. Those who hear it lose their way, their minds wandering into that wondrous mist.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blissfully ignorant, they soon find their ships torn asunder.</p>

          <p>It is said Seirens are born in a palace somewhere at sea, perhaps even outside Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They enchant sailors and lead them to their death. They're not avaricious or capricious--they're simply compelled to do so by instinct.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legend has it that when it is a Seiren's time to die, they return to the place of their birth, no matter how far they must travel.</p>

          <p>As tales of their fabulous nature grew, pirates and sailors came to attribute countless properties to Seirens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some people were cured of disease after eating a Seiren's heart, though the Daevas of Medicine were puzzled by the result.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Other rumors persist that consuming a Seiren's heart could cause a Human to ascend, though this is often dismissed as fancy.</p>

          <p>Nearly all who ply the seas hear tales of the Golden Trumpet Temple. It is said to be a true wonder of the world.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to legend, the treasures recovered by the Seirens are all gathered here, forever out of the hands of those who sail the seas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Far below, in the abyssal depths, where even light cannot reach, the glittering mountains of treasure keep the Seirens company.</p>

          <p>The temple itself is named for the unique instrument of indescribable power, the Golden Trumpet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The amazing instrument was crafted by a peerless artisan captured by the Seirens. Under the Seiren's song, he tirelessly poured every bit of energy, creativity, and inspiration into his master work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is said he drowned amidst the cooing notes of praise heaped upon him by the Seirens, his lifelong wish of creating a true artifact fulfilled.</p>

          <p>As to the Golden Trumpet, it produced a cacophonous blast by when necessary, or a song that would make a Balaur lord purr.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Golden Trumpet also called forth ferocious waves that threatened any ship at sea and kept the Temple safe from discovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even today, when the waves crash and the winds howl, sailors warn the whiskerless swabs that the Golden Trumpet is sounding something fierce.</p>

          <p>A mysterious Daeva came to the tavern in a village, got very drunk, and loudly boasted of visiting the Golden Trumpet Temple.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The so-called Daeva was dressed in rags and many dismissed his tale, but to the astonishment of all, he produced a tiny gilded cage, encrusted with jewels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The tale of the cage and the Temple spread quickly, but the Daeva was gone by morning. The legend, however, lived on.</p>
