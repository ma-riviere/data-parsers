          <p>Even though we Asmodians are used to the cold, we can't live without fire. Only fire can warm a soldier after a long patrol or cook the meat of fresh game.</p>

          <p>This torch I guard is fueled by Aether brought from Pandaemonium, so it is never extinguished by the wind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When it becomes dark, I make the torch brighter to prevent the Undead from coming near.</p>
