          <p>Most think Sapiens are inferior. Some people even think that Skurvs or Mau are animals.</p>

          <p>They're wrong. Sapiens are different, but they're not inferior.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have merits we can learn from. We should give them the credit they deserve.</p>
