          <p>My farm is the envy of everyone, and not for nothing, frankly. Not that I mean to brag...I'm just saying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take this Aukwi, for instance.  My daughter named it Dukar. You may think it's nothing to brag about as Aukwis are so common. But this one can talk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It doesn't say anything important or recite poetry, of course--it is just an Aukwi--but it can talk!</p>

          <p>Yes! Go ahead and talk to it. See if it will talk back to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All it ever seems to say is that it wants to eat something. It's always hungry, but it hardly eats a bite. Dukar is the pickiest Aukwi I've ever seen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I paid a lot of money for this silly creature. What if it just keels over from starvation?</p>

          <p>It constantly asks for meat, but it won't eat just anything.</p>

          <p>Some say that the tail of a Festering Clodworm is the finest meat around. I know the name sounds disgusting, but it's really quite delicious.</p>
