          <p>We're trying to find out what happened to the Daevas we lost. We see them go, then that's it. No rhyme nor reason. Nothing. We have one clue.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They sometimes leave their possessions, so we go out looking for them. Maybe we'll be able to find a pattern in the disappearances, but at least we'll be able to re-use their equipment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, we also pick up a lot of useless junk. Look at this thing, for example. Found it a few days ago.</p>

          <p>Good eyes. They wear these on their tails. As with all things Shugo, the size and value of the thing denotes class.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I could just sell this, but you never know when you'll need a favor from a Shugo. Makes much more sense to me to find the owner, and give it back to them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you have time to return this, [%username]? There are a couple of Shugos I see around here a lot--it could belong to either [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_4] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_3].</p>

          <p>Good. It looks expensive, and I'm sure the Shugo it belongs to will want it back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, here's where it gets complicated. The two Shugos that I mentioned before, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_4] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_3], have been cursed by something, and now one can only be here during the day, and the other at night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have no idea which of the two actually owns the thing, and I doubt either will be honest enough to not claim ownership. You're going to need to guess the owner.</p>

          <p>Let's trust your gut feeling. You'll find Padinerk over by the Sky Temple of Arkanis, so just head over there and see what he says when he's reunited with the accessory.</p>
