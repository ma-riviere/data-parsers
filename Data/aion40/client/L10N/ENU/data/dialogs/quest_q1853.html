          <p>You know, I'm sorry I ever doubted your abilities. Oh? You didn't realize. Well, I suppose there's no shame in admitting how very wrong I was.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm glad I have someone like you to rely on, since I must spend my time plotting strategy instead of on the field of battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is an important task I would like your help with.</p>

          <p>It won't surprise you to know that we are going after Asmodian troops. However, our targets are very specific. I don't want to waste your time taking out low-level soldiers. No, we need you to target officers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you take out a few of them, their morale will crumble, and their strategies disintegrate. It'll be easy enough for us to wipe the rest of them out.</p>

          <p>Any officer will do; from 1-star to 5-star, they are all intimidating to our forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you happen across any Generals, you can target them as well, but don't waste your time with the regular troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And, as you know, the beasts tend to hunt in packs, so take some allies with you.</p>
