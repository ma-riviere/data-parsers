          <p>Sorry to keep you waiting. My hairpin broke the other day, and now it won't hold my hair in place. It's driving me up the obelisk!</p>

          <p>You are the kindest Daeva I know! You can find a lot of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_gb_source_jewelry_d_20a] in the volcanic region near here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many fierce animals around there, like Keraton and Maeki, so please be very careful.</p>
