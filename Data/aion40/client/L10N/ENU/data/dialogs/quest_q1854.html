          <p>Long gone are the days when I could simply throw myself into a fight without having to think too deeply about strategy and maneuvers. It was just me, my weapon, and the Asmodians who stood in my way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I must spend all my time worrying about supply lines and deployment. Luckily for me, I have veterans like you to depend on.</p>

          <p>Yes, a most important one. We must break the enemy's morale completely, leave them defenceless for our onslaught.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe you already know how much difference one skilled commander can make in the course of a war, and that is why we must eliminate the Asmodian Generals. Without them, it's just a mob of beasts with no control and no direction.</p>

          <p>Excellent! Those generals may have many years of experience, but you are clever, and your allies loyal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your first task is to track them down; there are no more than 30 of them in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may have to kill some lesser forces in order to get to the Generals, but waste as little time as possible on them. They are below your notice.</p>
