          <p>I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but we've done just fine without the help of any Daevas until now--even when people first became afflicted with the undead curse and we had to take refuge here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We, the Watch, managed to take care of things. We're familiar with the land, and we truly care about the villagers.</p>

          <p>Of course, there are times when we feel our limits rather keenly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GraveknightD_38_An]s around here, so whenever we need to go out to get firewood and food we must have Archons accompanying us. Frankly, it really hurts our pride.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We might be able to do something ourselves if only those Graveknight Soldiers weren't around. Would you be willing to vanquish some of them for us? </p>

          <p>Until now, I was very reluctant to take help from Daevas. If we rely on someone else how can we ever hope to stand alone?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is also wisdom in knowing your limits. I'll be happy to receive your help this time. If you can vanquish the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_GraveknightD_38_An]s for us, we shall all be better off.</p>
