          <p>I have taught Handicrafting to many Daevas, but never have I seen someone reach such a high level so quickly. I think you have a special talent for Handicrafting, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let's test that theory, shall we...?</p>

          <p>Make Lanse's Noble Necklace and bring it to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you know, this necklace is not easy to make. That's why it is a perfect item to test your ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, and if you agree to become a Handicrafting Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So think carefully before you answer.</p>

          <p>All right, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DC1_5] has the design for Lanse's Noble Necklace. Don't confuse it with [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2976]. They look similar, but are lands apart.</p>

          <p>If you don't put your heart and soul into Handicrafting, you'll never see the potential of the craft. What makes the craft truly fascinating is that you can create items to enhance a Daeva's ability.</p>
