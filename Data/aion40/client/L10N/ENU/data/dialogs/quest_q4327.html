          <p>Pick of the litter, they said. "Come to Alsig Village! Streets made of gold, and money just laying around." So, when I was assigned this post, I figured I'd hit the jackpot.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I get here and... nothing. Just regular people, regular problems, and regular streets. No gold.</p>

          <p>Well, not exactly....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, one of the residents here, Balom, he's got more money than most, and a strong hatred for Worgs to boot. He's gone and put a bounty on the creatures, as it happens, and is promising a big old reward for whoever kills the most.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can kill hundreds of them, but need a few [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_4327A]s first. If you want in on the bounty, why don't you kill a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CentipedeD_30_An]s, collect their thorns, and bring them to me?</p>
