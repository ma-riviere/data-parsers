          <p>Ah, [%username]...could I ask one more favor?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Afari problem caused trouble with another kind of fish...and I was hoping you'd help me.</p>

          <p>Well, the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_n_c_20a]s have been rare lately and, while cutting the Afari population will help, I don't think it will be enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want to dig up a pool for them to stay in, secluded from the other fish. It would be so helpful if you gathered them up while I got the pool in shape.</p>

          <p>Great. Nine [%dic:STR_DIC_E_fish_n_c_20a]s should be a good start--enough for them to breed without fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lapia are more difficult to catch, but I'm sure you'll do fine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get going right away. I hope to have the pool done when you return.</p>

          <p>You helped Lano by culling the Afari, but he said that that wouldn't solve the problem completely. He wanted to raise Lapia separately to increase their number.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you were out catching them, he made a pool to keep them in.</p>
