          <p>As you know, we're still trying to get a feel for this region, its layout, and its troubles. I just heard of one that's fascinating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's seems there's a place called the Island of Eternity that has some interesting legends surrounding it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't help but wonder if its power might have something to do with Bollvig...or holds secrets that could help us against him.</p>

          <p>The Island of Eternity is actually a set of three islands in southeast Heiron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It looks like there's no way to get there from the mainland, but there's actually an invisible bridge you can cross, if you know where to look.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On those islands reside Kerubs with unusual powers. I want to know what those powers are and where they come from. I have a feeling the knowledge would be useful. Can you help?</p>

          <p>The Kerubs in question are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim2_46_Ah], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim3_47_Ah], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_BLF3_NM_Cherubim4_48_Al].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll probably have to fight them to find out more. I know some scholars who can learn a lot from whatever you can tell me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I suggest you bring some trustworthy crewmates with you. Even if all you'll face is Kerubs, I'm sure they're no pushovers.</p>

          <p>Yes, none of this probably has anything to do with Bollvig directly. But if we could tap into whatever powers exist there....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Think about it! If those Kerubs can be serious threats, imagine what we could become! We could turn the entire tide of this war!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't you at least have any curiosity about the place? Don't you want to find out more about it?</p>

          <p>Fascinating! Hold on, I have to write all this down! My scholars will have a field day with this!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You may have fought a few Kerubs, but you also brought us one large step closer to penetrating the Island's secrets.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could win easily over Bollvig...over the entirety of Asmodae and Balaurea! But those are just dreams...for now. Here's a reward for your excellent work.</p>
