          <p>I want you to infiltrate the Dredgion. That ship has stood in the way of our conquest of Reshanta for too long.</p>

        	<p>Good. Go to the Obelisk Fragment. There, Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Henir] will give you a detailed briefing--how to infiltrate the Dredgion and what to do once you're inside.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hear the Elyos have been focused on the Dredgion as well, so keep that in mind--don't be surprised by anything.</p>

          <p>The Dredgion is only occasionally vulnerable, so timing is crucial to this mission. Special Administration Officer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Buri] will keep you apprised of the ship's status--he can send you there when the time is right. So can [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ockham] at Primum Wharf and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rukbar] in Primum Plaza. You'll need to be ready at a moment's notice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seriously, think about bringing some back-up. That ship is full of Balaur and Drakan troops.</p>
