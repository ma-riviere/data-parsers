          <p>It's hurting morale, having to sit and wait here like this. You may have heard rumblings among the men...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we must wait for reinforcements before we try anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We just don't have the force to take them head-on.</p>

          <p>Oh, would you? Not you alone of course, since I was going to ask you to kill elite troops, and they're no pushovers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>But if you could get some friends to help you out, taking down those troops would be great for morale.</P>

          <p>Let me give you some advice: hit them when the fortress is vulnerable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Other than that, this should be simple, if your allies are as strong as you say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One more thing: if the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_2812_all] is carrying [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2812a]s, could you bring them back to me? Trophies are great for morale.</p>

          <p>Yes, that will do nicely. I'll call a meeting with my men shortly, and maybe you could tell them about the battle.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We still have to keep our position here, but hearing stories of glorious battle can be almost as good as the real thing.</p>
