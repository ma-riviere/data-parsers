          <p>You vanished however, so something or someone got the drop on you. We must prepare you better this time.</p>

          <p>They just pester me to build this or fashion that. I'm not going to live forever, you know!</p>

          <p>I know Pernos thinks I can produce miracles, but for the battle I forsee you in, you'll need something better. I recommend the Shugos of the Tigraki Workshop.</p>
