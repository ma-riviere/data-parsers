          <p>This village is quite desolate, isn't it? Believe it or not, this place is a big improvement. When I first came here, we all slept and ate on the ground. You should've seen the bug bites!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, we have the Observatory, an obelisk, and even merchants! Looks almost like a real village. But we're still lacking basic Human comforts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For one thing, there's nothing to eat around here.</p>

          <p>Fortunately, Litreas and Razes fill the Latheron Coast--we used to collect them. But Scolopens and Lobseks think Litreas are tasty, too. We're having a hard time filling our baskets and bellies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes I go to the coast and hunt them, but they breed so fast! No matter how many we kill, they just keep coming!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been asking Daevas who wander through to kill them. So, what do you think? Up for some hunting?</p>
