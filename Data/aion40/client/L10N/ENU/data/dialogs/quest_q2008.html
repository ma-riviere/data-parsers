          <p>Since our first meeting, I have seen something different in you, [%username]. You may already have your suspicions, but now it's time to uncover the truth. The truth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your future is a path ahead of you. You can meander along the path's branches, but your ultimate destination is set.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whether you are ready or not, I must show you that destination. But beware! Beware! Some cannot handle a truth so wondrous and terrifying.</p>

          <p>We shall see, [%username]. Let me be clear about the stakes: I believe you will ascend beyond mortality--beyond death itself. I believe you will soon become a Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I sense something else. Your eyes show fire...a fire I have not seen for years. That fire reminds of another pair of eyes....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A pair of eyes gazing back at me from within the waters of Gribade Crater Lake, its waters churning as the fiery remnants of the Tower of Eternity drifted away from our planet...</p>

          <p>Yes. I was there when the Tower of Eternity was destroyed and Atreia torn asunder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I watched my friends and family scream in terror as our world was ripped apart. Something knocked me out. When I awoke, I lie face down in the lake. I should have died twice that day. Instead, I discovered I'd ascended. That's when I saw eyes like yours--under the surface of the lake.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But enough! Enough of my past--let us see what is yet to come. First, I need three cards of fate from longtime allies of mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My allies haven't heard from me in years, though they know I'm imprisoned here. They live secret lives among the raiders and cutthroats in Ishalgen. Each remains loyal and will surrender a card of fate if you mention my name.</p>

          <p>First, you must call on Urd in Aldelle Village. She was the first to discover where I'd been imprisoned after my...transgression. Urd carries the card that will show you your past--the first step toward your full revelation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Next, enter the Munihele Forest and visit Verdandi. Her behavior is strange...strange indeed. Speak to her, and she'll hand you a card depicting your present circumstances.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, head to the cliffs near Anturoon Crossing. You should find a lone girl there named Skuld. She holds the card of your future.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you have all three cards, return to me and we'll read them together.</p>

          <p>Assassins are servants of death, highly skilled with their poisons and their daggers, and capable of inflicting crippling wounds upon their foes before they've even revealed their presence. With the advantage of initiative, nothing can stand against them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A good Assassin knows when to fight and when to wait. Too headstrong, too impatient, and you'll suffer the consequences of your own weakness. Precision, awareness, and speed are the hallmarks of the talented Assassin.</p>
          <p> </p>
