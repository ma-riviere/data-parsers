          <p>Your success in the last mission is commendable, [%username]. That dark-winged Lisya knows a fine recruit when she sees one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm reassured by your presence. I wish for a moment of respite, yet we cannot rest for the enemy will not.</p>

          <p>The enemy we are up against this time is very strong. The Rank 3 Elyos Soldiers are veterans who have gone through hell and high water in the Abyss. You'd best be careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I believe you have what it take to annihilate them, [%username]. Yet I warn you, your opponents will kill you without a qualm if given the opportunity. Be safe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you defeat the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade3]s for the Red Hasia and for Asmodae?</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you, shadow-blessed. The Elyos soldiers will shiver with fear and take wing when they see you set upon their ranks. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, there is little point wasting your time killing those who pose the rest of us no trouble. You're a talent best spent fighting their best, [%username]. And if you aren't fighting them, then they'll cause all manner of trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm confident that you will defeat them and return safe.</p>
