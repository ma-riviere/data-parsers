          <p>No need for the weapon--please, just listen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone from your side promised me that a Daeva would come who could help me with my work. I knew it was you as soon as you approached. How should I put this...? You smell of shadows.</p>

          <p>I came here to collect information on the Indratu Legion Brigade General and other leaders inside the fortress. But those Draconutes and Nagarants make it almost impossible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And even if I got inside, I couldn't do much. There are Drakan in there. Have you ever fought them? They control the Draconutes and Nagarants--they're smart and they wield powerful magic.</p>

          <p>Yep. They'll sniff me out no matter how careful I may be. That's where you come in.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you infiltrate the fortress and get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanFighter_47_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanAssassin_47_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanWizard_47_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF3CI_DrakanPriest_47_Ae]s?</p>

          <p>One thing more--I need proof that you completed the mission. I don't want to be surprised when I go in there. Bring me the tail of every Drakan you kill inside the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take some help if you need it--any useful companions you may have. Just bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1518a]s.</p>

          <p>Please try again. Defeat the Drakan inside the Indratu Fortress and bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1518a]s. This mission is critical for Elysea.</p>

          <p>Now that's a lot of Drakan tails! You've cleared the way for me, [%username], and I'm grateful.</p>

          <p>I may ask you to carry out similar missions in the future--the Balaur replace their personnel pretty quickly.</p>

          <p>Erebus was pleased, and told you that he might need to assign you the same mission later because the Indratu Legion reinforces its troops quickly.</p>
