          <p>You distinguished yourself in destroying the Lepharists' facilities. Of course, no good deed goes unrewarded--or perhaps unpunished.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I asked for someone to help me infiltrate the Alquimia Research Center, Archon command recommended you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've no choice but to trust you with the mission. Do you know the password?</p>

          <p>Fine, no passwords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not all parts of the research center were destroyed when the bomb was dropped. Although gutted, the frame was intact, so they repaired the building and resumed Human experiments. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've just discovered that Atla has been captured. She's the famous researcher who studies the Lepharists. We can't delay! Every second Alta is one step closer to...I can't even imagine! Will you do it? Will you save her?</p>

          <p>Thank you! I believe Atla has learned some vital new information--why else would they risk a kidnapping in Pandaemonium? </p>

          <p>They've taken her to one of the labs in the Alquimia Research Center. If she's there too long she may never return. Please, hurry!</p>
