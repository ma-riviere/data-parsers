          <p>When I came to Eltnen, I was shocked at all the people wanting to remove their manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Equipping any manastone they have, and changing them out it when finding a "better" one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What a waste of Kinah.</p>

          <p>There's really nothing for it. Once an equipped manastone is removed, it cannot be used again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not so bad for me--the more manastones I remove, the more Kinah I make. It's just a pity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If people just collected their manastones and brought them to me, I could exchange them for a better one.</p>

          <p>Well, first off, don't just equip every manastone you find. Give some thought to people who might have better uses for them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, if you brought me one each of the MP +40, Evasion +8, and Parry +16 manastones, I could give you a really superior manastone in exchange.</p>

          <p>Okay then. Don't forget to check your warehouse, as well as your cube. I see so many people who completely forget what they have found while travelling.</p>
