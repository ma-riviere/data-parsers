          <p>Ha! Good to know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you'll do fine then. This is a confidential message for Sentinel [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Novan] in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_A1].</p>

          <p>You may tell him that I sent it, but don't mention it to anyone else. Okay?</p>

          <p>Yes, I suppose it's beneath a Daeva to perform as a simple courier. I suppose I could use the Shugo Express Mail Service, but...it doesn't seem that safe to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know the Zephyr Guild wants to keep this secret, and the Shugos are crazy for Kinah. They might sell the information for money.</p>

          <p>Hail there, Daeva. What brings you out here to such a remote and barren place?</p>

          <p>A courier you say? Well, you should be very cautious. The Manduri occasionally waylay passers by for their possessions, but that's nothing compared to the Lepharist Revolutionaries!</p>
