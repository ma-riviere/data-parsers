          <p>Thanks to you [%username], the morale of the Red Hasia Legionaries is improving--we may yet see an end to this unceasing war and strife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have an opportunity to deal a crushing blow to our enemies. Victory is close at hand!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now is the moment to strike at their core forces. And I can think of no better Daeva than you, [%username], to lead this mission.</p>

          <p>Sixth Rank Soldiers are skilled veterans of war, but they are not invincible. Think: While they were raised in a life of ease and abundance, your strength was tested by the hardships of life in Asmodae. You faced monsters in the dark when those Ellies were dancing in, ugh, sunlight. You can defeat those weaklings. I've every confidence in you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Lgrade6]s carry out important missions for the Elyos. When you defeat them, you weaken all of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready to test yourself further?</p>
