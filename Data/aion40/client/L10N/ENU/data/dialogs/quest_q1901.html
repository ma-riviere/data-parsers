          <p>You wish to learn the Krallic tongue, you say? While I salute your dedication, the Krallic language is barbarous and uncouth. Speaking it is like gargling mud.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If it's a matter of needing an interpreter, I'm sure Marmeia would be willing to assist you. She's an expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose a patient student might eventually master the basics of Krallic. It would, however, take considerable time and effort.</p>

          <p>[%username], you are child of the Aether. You are blessed with youth eternal, and a legacy of unfading glory. Why such haste?</p>

          <p>Any task worth achieving takes time. Look around you at this citadel of archived wisdom. Inhale the redolence of parchment, leather, paper and ink. Such knowledge is not to be had with a snap of the fingers.</p>

          <p>The Shugos, as you know, speak many languages. This is not entirely due to natural aptitude--they also have an artificial method.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Shugos brew a particular potion, heavily infused with Aether, which affects the linguistic center of the mind. One dose, it is said, will grant the power to learn a whole new language in minutes. A gift of tongues, if you will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do know one Shugo who is likely as any to possess this potion. Would you care to meet him?</p>

          <p>To the East lies the Tempest Shipyard, where sky-vessels are wrought. Seek Kunberunerk. I doubt you'll need to search for long--he's President of Tempest Shipyard, and is there every day.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At night he's a regular at the Dionysia Tavern, where he drinks and bemoans his overburdened life till unconsciousness claims him.</p>

          <p>Fuchsia told you there's a potion which could allow you to master Krallic instantly. She explained that the Shugos possessed such potions, and advised you to talk with Kunberunerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kunberunerk said that Marmeia, the Krall language expert, had the potion and advised you to meet her.</p>
