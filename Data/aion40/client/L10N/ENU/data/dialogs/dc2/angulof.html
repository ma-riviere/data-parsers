          <p>Fate is a funny thing. The oracles here see it, we follow it, yet even Lord Marchutan once sought to change it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, it was a simple experiment--hardly heresy. But that the Lord of Fate would even consider it... The ways of the Empyrean Lords are mysterious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is much wisdom in Marchutan's words, [%username]. You would do well to heed them.</p>
