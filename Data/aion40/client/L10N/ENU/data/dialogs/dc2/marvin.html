          <p>This is an important job and a great honor, but it's also very boring. Who'd be insane enough to attack an Empyrean Lord's temple, even if he's not around?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If someone did attack, it'd probably mean the gates of Pandaemonium itself had been breached. And in that case, I'd gladly give my life to defend Lord Marchutan's honor.</p>
