          <p>Some people say if you're smart, the world is yours. Pfah. Only fools who know nothing of intelligence would think that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>True, my genius has served me and Pandaemonium well. But it has also isolated me--I can hardly hold a conversation without getting blank stares. I have to stifle the urge to correct every bit of ignorance. Where are my true peers?</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's not just about social skills. Sometimes the value of my research isn't apparent to the layman, and unimaginable frustration follows. Sometimes I wonder if my intellect is worth the trouble it causes me.</p>
