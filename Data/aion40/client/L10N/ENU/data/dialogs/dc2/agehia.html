          <p>Why do I sit in Lord Marchutan's chair, you ask?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have his complete trust. When he is away, I am in charge of his temple. Therefore, I take his seat of authority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have my own misgivings about even attempting to take his place, but it is his decree and I follow his will.</p>

          <p>Azphelumbra, Daeva. Was Empyrean Lord Marchutan expecting you? I am sorry, but he is in Gelkmaros, personally leading the crusade against Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you want to see him, go there. He would appreciate the talents of a [%userclass] like you in the battles ahead.</p>   
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you wish to stay here, do so, but please do not get in anyone's way. We have much to do.</p>
