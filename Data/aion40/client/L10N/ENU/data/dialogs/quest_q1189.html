          <p>Here on the coast, we're so close to the Tursin Outpost you can smell it. Hot days, it makes your eyes sting!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Krall leave us alone, mostly. Guess we don't have anything they want. No raiders at all, Asmodians or Sapiens...just the sun and the sea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Potcrabs. The endless, clicky-clacking, creepy-crawling, crazy-making Potcrabs.</p>

          <p>Look at them, [%username]! Everywhere nearby! Swarming with Potcrabs! I hear 'em all night...thousands of them, scuttling and feeding. Makes me nauseous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I was first posted here, there were only a few. Population's just exploded, though! If they had a natural predator, it seems something's killed it off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They aren't dangerous--they only attack if you step on them...but it's gotten harder and harder not to! They get into the Observatory and disturb Khidia's concentration. That really could be dangerous! If she misses a breach in the field because of a stupid Potcrab scuttling around?</p>

          <p>I know. All we can do is cull the things. We usually take care of them ourselves, but now we've been told to keep to our stations--there's a shipwreck up the coast, and the officers don't like the look of those folks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Potcrabs are annoying, but they're a nuisance at worst. Sneaky vagrants are something else. Got to keep watch in case they try anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, think you can you bash in a few shells for us?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>You'll have no trouble finding [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA150]s. Walk ten paces in a straight line and you'll likely fall over one. I keep a tally by collecting [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA88]. Gather seven or more pincers if you can.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if you think of a recipe for two thousand Potcrab pincers, please share it!</p>

          <p>So, thanks, on behalf of my sanity. Should be able to keep the observatory crab-free for a while. Khidia will appreciate that.</p>

          <p>The number of Potcrabs inhabiting the Cantas Coast has suddenly exploded, putting the Guardians stationed at the Observatory in an awkward position. They can't leave their posts to cull the Potcrabs because of a suspicious shipwreck further up the coast. You helped them by hunting Potcrabs and bringing back their Sharp Pincers as a tally.</p>
