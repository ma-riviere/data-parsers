          <p>Actually, while you're still here, I've the perfect gift for Luurinerk. Shugos are driven by Kinah, true, but they love Shugo Grass like Elrocos love nuts and seeds.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the perfect way to keep your name in the Shugo good books. I send it to all my Shugo contacts whenever I can, and in turn they keep me up to date with the latest news and technology.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <P>Now Luurinerk has brought me these samples, and I'll provide him with some Shugo Grass to keep him sweet. Sounds fair, right?</P>

          <p>Good. Now, would you be able to take the stuff to him for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd do it myself, only there's too much research to do. Pandaemonium's scientists have already contacted me asking to pass my findings directly to them.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>No doubt they want to see if Asmodian armor can be imbued with Malek, and if it is strengthened as a result.</P>
