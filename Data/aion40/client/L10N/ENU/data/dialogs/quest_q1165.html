          <p>I tell you, I've seen true faith, but only in the eyes of others. There was a pilgrim came passing through here once. I let her stay on my farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could see straight away that she wouldn't stay long, that her ambitions were more lofty than farming.</p>

          <p>I gave her a room and saw that she didn't want for anything. It's only right, I think. Pilgrims live a hard life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And that's what she was, touring every holy ground in Elysea and paying homage to each sacred area as she went. There's something inspiring in that.</p>          
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried to convince her to stay longer, to teach me more of Ariel and the Seraphim Lords. It was selfish, and did no good anyway. She was only here for a couple of days.</p>

          <p>Today I learned that the pilgrim and her husband left the village for Zumion Canyon. They can't have been gone long. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wanted to give this to [%dic:STR_DIC_LA71], but I never got the chance. I can't leave now or the farm will go to ruin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you help, Daeva? Take this to her? She'll be in [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA18], I've no doubt of that.</p>
