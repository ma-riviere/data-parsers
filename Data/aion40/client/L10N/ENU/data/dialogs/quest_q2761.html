          <p>Yes--it comes from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_Elementalwater3_30_An]s. Isn't that crazy? I've taken mineral samples from boulders, caves, even lava, but never from a spirit!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, it's all from ancient legends. I'd give my right hand to know the truth, but I'm about to give up!</p>

          <p>Well, I'm on a job gathering metal ores for our forges back home, though I really volunteered because of those stories.</p>

          <p>I finally reach Lake Asteria, where this [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1251_Elementalwater3_30_An] is known to live, and now they want me to move on without even a glimpse of it. They've kept me so busy mining that I've had no time to look!</p>
