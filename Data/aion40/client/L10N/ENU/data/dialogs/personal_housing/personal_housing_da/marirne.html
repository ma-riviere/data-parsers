          <p>See my partner over there? Maidan?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was in love with a girl back in Pandaemonium. Watched her for years, waiting for the right moment to tell her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Waited too long, I guess, because the day he found out she was engaged to someone else was the day he put in for a transfer here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hates it when I tell this story. Look at him--ha! Oh, he's furious, I can tell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you just imagine him all moon-eyed over some dumb girl?</p>
