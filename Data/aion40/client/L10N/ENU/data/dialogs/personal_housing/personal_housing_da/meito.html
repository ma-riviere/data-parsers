          <p>Hello, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nice [%mainslotitem]. My Sensei let me use one of those in training. He said I was surprisingly good with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wrote a poem about it, actually. Maybe you've heard it. I turned it into a song that's popular in Pandaemonium now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's nice, but it's nothing like what I'm going to accomplish after I Ascend. I'll be a hero for all of Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not like that stupid Rarniel. All she wants to do is read.</p>
