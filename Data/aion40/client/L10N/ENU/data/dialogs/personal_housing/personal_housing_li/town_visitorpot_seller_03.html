          <p>I am sure that you're looking for Guestblooms, but I'm afraid my selection is restricted to village residents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many of these Guestblooms are quite rare, and it wouldn't be fair for me to sell them to outsiders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now if you buy a home in this village, it'll be a different story.</p>
