          <p>When I first moved here, everyone stopped to say "Arieluma" to one another.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We knew our neighbors. We held street parties because no one had enough room in their house for all the locals to attend a private event.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These days though... Is it too much to say "sun's blessings" when you see someone?</p>
