          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not like I'm really picky, either! I just want a Daeva with a decent Abyss Rank, a steady income, a full mane. And dark eyes but light hair, full lips, and at least a hand's span higher than me. Oh, and he has to know how to cook, because I don't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That doesn't seem too hard to find! There have got to be plenty of Daevas like that around, right?</p>
