          <p>Most Daevas seem to think that we gardeners only manage the central gardens in a village. What they do not realize is that we care for all the gardens, even little flowerpots!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everyone thinks we just do a little watering and weeding and then relax, but it is hard work we Shugos do, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please remember that next time you see a village with beautiful flowers everywhere.</p>
