          <p>Pernon is more beautiful than anywhere I've been in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's full of absolutely gorgeous botanical specimen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not to mention plenty of space for gardening.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I love the cycle of gardening. Nurturing seeds as they grow, watching them flourish into beautiful plants, and saving their seeds to start again with. It's soothing, and makes me feel closer to Atreia.</p>
