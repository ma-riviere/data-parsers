        	<p>Burglars! In this peaceful village! Unheard of! Why, this village is so safe, we barely have any walls.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>Cannot imagine why, but Shulack Pickpockets snuck into our village and stole from Daevas AND Shugos! Those fiends even picked flowers from my garden!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How does Shugo know? Who else would be so merciless as to ruin beautiful, newly-bloomed flowers. They must be punished! Please, kind Daeva, find them and bring justice for my poor flowerbeds.</p>
