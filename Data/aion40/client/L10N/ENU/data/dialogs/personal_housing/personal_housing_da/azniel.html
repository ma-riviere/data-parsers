          <p>There's already so much suffering in the world. I've been in battle and seen plenty myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Animals may not be as smart as us, but they feel fear and pain like we do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's enough to make me believe it's wrong to hurt them. It's not fair to cause them pain just because they taste good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nobody likes hurting animals. They just don't stop to think about it.</p>
