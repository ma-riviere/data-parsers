          <p>A long time ago, my daughter contracted a terrible fever. We were certain she would die.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cared for her while my husband traveled to Lord Marchutan's shrines. There, he begged for our daughter's Ascension. It was the only way we could think of to keep her alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our prayers were answered, and our little girl's wings unfurled on what we thought would be her death bed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my husband... he was beaten to death by Krall Raiders and returned to the Aetherstream before he could see her smile again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I Ascended when I learned the news. Now my daughter and I will live forever with only the memory of the man who was her father.</p>
