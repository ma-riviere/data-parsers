          <p>Before you ask, yes, I am THAT Inzelli, and yes, yes, my mother was THAT Curessi.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we are more than our money, Daeva. We are philanthropists to the core.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I personally run a home for abandoned pets. Or pay for it, at least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And my dear mother is absolutely passionate about preserving the traditional folk-art of Brusthonian operatic throat-yarbling.</p>

          <p>I cannot even imagine a world without it! Can you?</p>
