          <p>There are a lot of guards in Pernon. We're everywhere. I can't figure out why. It's so peaceful here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And so many Daevas live here, too. Couldn't they defend Pernon if something happened?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not complaining or anything. I like being stationed here just fine. It's warmer than Altgard, at least. But why so many guards...?</p>
