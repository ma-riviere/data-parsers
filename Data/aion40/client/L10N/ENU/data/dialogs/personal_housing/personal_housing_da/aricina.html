          <p>Oh, I don't really leave Pernon anymore. Why would I? Everything I need is here.</p>

          <p>I've been to Pandaemonium a couple of times. It's just so... busy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the crime rates! Pandaemonium isn't that bad, but I heard that in other parts of Asmodae you can't go anywhere without a weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pernon is better. There's really great shopping here!</p>
