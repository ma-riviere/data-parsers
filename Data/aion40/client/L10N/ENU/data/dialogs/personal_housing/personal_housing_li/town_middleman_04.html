          <p>I am sorry, Daeva, but I can only broker trades between residents in this village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe Daeva would like to buy a home here and work with fellow residents?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Never a better time to buy than now. Just beware of sub-prime Shugo loan merchant.</p>
