        	<p>The village is named for the mist that seems to shroud both it and the road almost all the time.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>It is an odd thing, to be standing on the road in the middle of a thick mist. It can make you ask questions you do not ask yourself in bright sunlight. Like "Is this the life I really wanted?" Shugos are supposed to make lots of money, but we gardeners are paid so little for such hard work.</p>
