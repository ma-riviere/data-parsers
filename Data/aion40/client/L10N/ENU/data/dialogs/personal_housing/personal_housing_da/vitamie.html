          <p>I'm new to Pernon, been in the Abyss for years. I heard this crazy story right before I left--I've just got to share it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Legend has it, back in the Empyrean Lords' days, two of them fell in love and had a kid. Crazy, right? Story is, they hid him from the rest of the Empyrean Lords for a long time, built some kind of giant playground to keep him occupied.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But eventually he grew too smart and strong to be jailed like that. Either he escaped, or Aion killed him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sure hope he didn't escape. Can you imagine the child of Empyrean Lords? He'd be powerful... and probably crazy!</p>
