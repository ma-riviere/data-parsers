          <p>Poor Shugo tends flowers all day, for unappreciative, trampling Studio residents. Some children came through yesterday and picked a bunch of flowers. Naughty, bratty children! Nyerk!</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Flowers ought to be appreciated with the eyes, and smelled with the nose. Not picked, and NOT TRAMPLED. I asked for assignment to nice, quiet place, but Village Improvement Society say "No - must work here".</p>
