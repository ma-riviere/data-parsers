          <p>I brought my family here because it's stable. I don't have to worry about my children tripping into a Karnif den while playing.</p>

          <p>Is that cowardly?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think so. Knowing that my family is safe means I can focus all of my energy on fighting for Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But am I just making excuses for my choice?</p>
