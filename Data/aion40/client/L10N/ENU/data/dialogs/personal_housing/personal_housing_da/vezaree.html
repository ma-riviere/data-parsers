          <p>I like gathering items from the natural world. Plants, ores, all kinds of things.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I first started training as a Daeva, I didn't have time to pay attention to the things growing around me. It's easy to forget about the amazing resources that Atreia provides us when you're slaying Balaur all the time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since I came here, I've had more time to look around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You should practice gathering around here. You won't regret it!</p>
