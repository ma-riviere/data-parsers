          <p>I've been reading this book called "Ascended: the Higher Path Goes Nowhere."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It claims that Daevas are statistically a lot unhappier than Humans.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to the author, being immortal doesn't solve any problems, it just creates new ones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You lose your family and friends, and lose the opportunity to choose what to do with your life. You're basically stuck becoming a soldier in the war against Elysea, or you're scorned for cowardice. But we Humans can choose how to live, even though we get less time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're a Daeva, right? What do you think?</p>
