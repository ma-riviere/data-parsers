          <p>I'm a Literature Critic, but I don't tell many people in Pernon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People here don't really read much literature, and my job probably makes me seem pretentious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't like that at all. I'm a normal Daeva, not a pampered intellectual. I've woken under the Obelisk many a time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>People in this village think that you can either be tough or smart.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's ridiculous. Someday I'm going to kick one of their butts and show them I've got brains AND brawn.</p>
