          <p>I've been doing this a long time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It pays pretty well. When I first got the job, I thought I'd be able to save up and buy a Mount in no time. But living here is expensive!</p>

          <p>When you're out on assignment somewhere remote, it's hard to spend all of your pay. What would you spend it on if you're living in tents?</p>

          <p>But here? Food, entertainment, teleportation costs... the bills really add up.</p>
