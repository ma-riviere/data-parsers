          <p>Whoa there, friend. Have you thought about slowing down, taking a moment to rest?</p>

          <p>You have? Then maybe you need a place of your own.</p>

          <p>I have to say I agree with you. Luxury is the way to go.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll be so comfortable when surrounded by the trappings of wealth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best homes of this type are out in Apex State, but they're more than a little pricey. Other beautiful locations are Silverspire Village, Reedpond Village, and Seapath Village.</p>

          <p>For pure, spartan functionality, a studio provides space and quiet, but you might get a little lonely since you'll never see your neighbors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd think about a detatched out in Beryl State instead. That's where I live, actually.</p>

          <p>Still, there's plenty of charm in Arcada State, and people who like water tell me that Riverwell Village and Reedpond Village are the right choices.</p>
