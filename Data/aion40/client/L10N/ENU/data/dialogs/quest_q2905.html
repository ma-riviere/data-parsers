          <p>Hmm...  Think. How best to handle this? Elgar needs a lesson, but I can't have him sulking...</p>

          <p>Oh... if you're placing orders, you're out of luck. All my steel ingots were melted to slag. Elgar over there, shade bless him, is the most claw-fisted Daeva of Flame this forge ever saw, and he didn't even notice it happen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's not a bad lad. Last time he screwed up this badly, he pelted out of the workshop and disappeared till the next day. I can't afford for that to happen again.</p>

          <p>Others, I'd agree. But young Elgar has had a rough enough time. He's lost too many family members, though he puts on a brave face. Call me soft, but there's no point kicking him when he's down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you'll serve, [%username]. Can you make [%dic:STR_DIC_I_recipe_d_ws_001]s? That way, work could go ahead, and Elgar would be... none the wiser.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Steel ingots are simple. You need iron ore and briquette charcoal. If enough Daevas pitch in, I can replace the whole stock. You'd only need to make three. I can teach you how.</p>

          <p>There's plenty of iron ore in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_3]. Dig out some ore, buy [%dic:STR_DIC_I_recipe_001]s from Mima there, and work it on my Weapon Forges. Easy [%dic:STR_DIC_I_recipe_d_ws_001]s!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Best bring about three times as much iron ore as required. First time out, you'll botch one or two tries. Quick as you can, please? Elgar is dim, but I can't stall forever.</p>
