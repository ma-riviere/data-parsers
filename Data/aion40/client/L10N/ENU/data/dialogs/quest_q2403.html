          <p>Well, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HarpyReD_36_An]s are picking over our fields. </p>

          <p>They've never done it before. I mean, they blunder onto fields, but this is different. Whole fields torn up!</p>

          <p>So I told Centurion Mirka we raise this with Letum. But she's ignoring it. "Viragos don't eat Tripeeds!" Hah!</p>
