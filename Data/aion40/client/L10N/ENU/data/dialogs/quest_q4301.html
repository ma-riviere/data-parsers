          <p>Pssst...[%username].... I need your help with something. This will require a little...tact.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's the thing. My wife has been spending more and more time with those dolled-up prissies at the boutique in Pandaemonium...and it's driving me crazy!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She keeps telling me I don't understand her...or something. I'm afraid I might lose her, but I heard of a little trick from a soldier who was having the same problem.</p>

          <p>Shhh! Keep it down [%username]! This is the sensitive part....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The soldier told me if I grind Ksellid teeth into a powder, it acts as a natural aphrodisiac...and drives women into a frenzy of passion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm ashamed that my wife prefers spending time with those sissies at the boutique, but if I could please her like that, I'm sure she'd never leave me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you help me out, [%username]?</p>

          <p>The soldier told me that Gourd Ksellids and Laggard Ksellids have the largest teeth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ksellids are all over this area, so you should have no trouble finding them. I need at least 18 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardD_25_An] teeth and 22 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardD_27_An] teeth.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good luck. If anyone asks why you're killing Ksellids...make up some nonsense about securing the supply route from Pandaemonium.</p>

          <p>Now just slip them into this pouch and smile...this is just a simple exchange. Yes...nothing odd about this.</p>

          <p>Thanks, [%username]. Take this as a reward, and make sure this stays between us! I'm sure I'll need more teeth if this works, so be sure to check in later. </p>
