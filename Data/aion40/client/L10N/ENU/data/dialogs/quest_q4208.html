          <p>I'm not an expert in this area, but I can tell you this--It's some sort of engine room designed in the architectural style of ancient Atreia. The writing is Shulack in origin.</p>

          <p>From what's written here, I believe it illustrates the internal structure of the ship Steel Rake.</p>
