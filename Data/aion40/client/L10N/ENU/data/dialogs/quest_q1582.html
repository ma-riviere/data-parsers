          <p>The Empyrean Lords have seen fit to gift me with visions, but sometimes I don't understand their meaning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These last few nights, I've dreamt of a spirit calling himself Kirenne. He storms around Medeus Manor in a rage--he's full of resentment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wake in a sweat, expecting to find him above my bed devouring my soul.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of years ago, Medeus Manor asked for reinforcements. My duty was to assess the situation, and things didn't look all that serious. I told them we couldn't spare troops. As I left, a local man stopped me. He...he knelt down and begged me to change my mind.</p>
