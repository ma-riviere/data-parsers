          <p>Technically, now that the Manastone Removers Association is unionized, I shouldn't have to stand out here and convince Daevas to find manastones for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a certified remover, with the local Morheim Union. I'm not a salesperson. And it's cold....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, what can I do, right? Anyway, today I need 10 each of the MP +40, Evasion +8, and Parry +16 manastones. I'll reward you well if you get them for me.</p>

          <p>MP +40, Evasion +8, and Parry +16 manastones. 10 of each of them. No singles, no loose ones, no chipped ones, no assortment bag. 10 of each!</p>
