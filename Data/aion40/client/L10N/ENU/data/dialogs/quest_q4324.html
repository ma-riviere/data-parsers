          <p>I don't mind action, but it seems this work never ends! Letum dumps all the work on me, trivial or not, and I'm forced to complete it while others stand around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a talented soldier, but even Contineo could handle some of these tasks, and he used to be a farmer! What's even worse is I have residents asking me for favors. If I have to find one more lost Porgus.... I swear on Azphel's shadow....</p>

          <p>In addition to all the other work that needs doing, residents are complaining about rampaging Scolopens. Even a small sting from a Poisontip Scolopen can be fatal, but I don't have time to go out and kill the beasts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Letum insists I do her work before I help the residents, even though none of this work is that important. Exterminating the Scolopens will save lives. Can you lend a hand, [%username]?</p>

          <p>We've wiped out the Scolopens several times, but the beasts reproduce fast. However, a skilled Daeva might make a difference.</p>

          <p>Kill the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ScorpionDF2_32_An]s around here. I think about 14 should do the trick.</p>

          <p>The Scolopens will be back though. We just have to keep killing them until their numbers stop replenishing.</p>

          <p>Take this as a reward. I hope it'll be useful. Now I'm off to find a lost Porgus...ughhh.</p>
