          <p>Now all I need to do is to deliver this Platinum Ore to Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only, I have some concerns...I originally planned to send it via the Shugo Express Mail, but I am...well, I'm out of cash.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I discovered that I needed Adamantium as well as Platinum. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's very hard to get Adamantium here. It cost me quite a bit more than I expected. </p>

          <p>I've been bombarding him with messages about the armor, so he's probably waiting for this.</p>

          <p>You just need to take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vulcanus], the Master Armorsmith in Sanctum.</p>

          <p>I'm sure he's anxious to get going on my order. It's such a relief to know I will soon have my armor.</p>

          <p>Ah, the Soul Healer in Eltnen finally got these, eh? He's been begging me for his armor, but he wants some very eccentric decorations, so I had to ask him to provide the materials.</p>

          <p>If he wants his armor this badly, I cannot put it off. Anything to shut him up. I'll start crafting it now.</p>
