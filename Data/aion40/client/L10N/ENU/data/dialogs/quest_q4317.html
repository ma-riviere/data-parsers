          <p>Think you've got talent now, tadpole? Hah! I invented talent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A real hunter has more than talent. No Asmodian is a born hunter. Well, except me. But even those born with skill or blessed by the Shedim Lords require training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To be a true hunter requires swiftness and endurance. You must scale treacherous mountains, navigate turbulent rivers, and cross searing deserts on foot. Only then will your body be ready.</p>

          <p>Hunt the Nimble Maeki, tadpole. Its swiftness in rugged terrain is without match. But do more than hunt it--watch it, mimic its movements, and understand its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When hunting the Maeki becomes simple, do it without sight, then without sound. A true hunter can slay the beast with nothing but their sense of smell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think, tadpole? Are you ready to challenge the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DisplacerbeastReD_25_An]s again?</p>
