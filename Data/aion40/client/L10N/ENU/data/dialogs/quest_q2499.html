          <p>Mysterious crystals have been found in many places around here. They don't break, split, or even scratch. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've no idea what they are--and because we don't know for certain, rumors are spreading. I need those rumors to stop.</p>

          <p>The most popular is that they are fragments of the Tower of Eternity, but we need samples sent to Pandaemonium for proper testing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once we identify them, people will stop this nonsense talk about pieces of the tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The crystals are found all over the Morheim Snow Field. Would you go there and collect 15 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_SmallCrystal_Q2499]?</p>

          <p>It will be hard to gather 15 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_SmallCrystal_Q2499], since they're nearly unbreakable. But they should be easy enough to locate all over the Morheim Snow Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fragments of the tower. Hah! </p>

          <p>Keep this to yourself for now. A rumor is a small problem. If it's true, we'll have even more to deal with.</p>

          <p>Hmm, so these are the suspicious crystals? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are definitely out of the ordinary. They contain a lot of Aether, but are too hard to be Odium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send them to Pandaemonium for study. The experts will know.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Rumor said they were fragments of the Aion Tower from the Cataclysm, and he wanted to quash that rumor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you located the mysterious crystals, collected them, and brought them to him as he requested. He said that he would send them to Pandaemonium to find out what they are.</p>
