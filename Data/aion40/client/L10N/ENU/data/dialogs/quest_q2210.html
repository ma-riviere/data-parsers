          <p>I just don't see the point. I think the fortress commander hates me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He gives me trivial tasks that take a lot of my time, but don't do justice to my skills. There's no challenge. No fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now I'm to make a report on the status of equipment and supplies dispatched outside the fortress.</p>

          <p>You have no idea. And our equipment gets dispatched to several different places. I've managed to collect information from most detachments, but Moslan Crossroad hasn't reported back yet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't suppose you plan to head that way?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you do, will you tell [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lovinja] to make a report on the current equipment and supply status and send it to me as soon as possible?</p>

          <p>Thank you. You can find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lovinja] at the Moslan Crossroad.</p>

          <p>I've heard the Karnifs are thick in the Moslan Forest, so be careful.</p>
