	<p>I've never been sent to a place as cold and flat as this one.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>The weather is probably why I don't see too many people coming for rewards--because I offer rewards for twenty and forty gold coins.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I reward Gladiators, Templars, Rangers, and Assassins. Other classes can get their rewards from Art here.</p>

	<p>You've brought me twenty gold coins. Remarkable.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>There are a lot of fake gold coins around at the moment. Let me examine these more closely.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Oh, they're genuine, all right. Issued by Pandaemonium. Don't get me wrong--I didn't suspect you, [%username]. Here's your reward, and I hope it serves you well.</p>

	<p>Not many Daevas bring me forty gold coins these days. It's very difficult to obtain that many, even for a skilled [%userclass].</p>

	<p>But you, [%username], are so famous that I'm not surprised to see forty gold coins from you.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I offer this reward to one blessed by the Shedim Lords.</p>
