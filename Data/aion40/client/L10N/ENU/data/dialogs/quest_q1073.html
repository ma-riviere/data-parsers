          <p>Always in war there is misery and suffering. Victory may come eventually, but the price is always high, even for the victor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's true that great victory can only be attained through great sacrifice--the wounded and prisoners of war, for example.</p>

          <p>Indeed. There are Elyos in Reshanta who are being held captive by our foes.</p>

          <p>I see. I wondered how long it would take them to find a Daeva capable of this.</p>

          <p>As you may have heard, the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ab1_1141_Light_28_An]s are imprisoned on the Isle of Disgrace, in the southeast part of the Sulfur Archipelago. It's well patrolled.</p>

          <p>I don't know which side is currently holding the Sulfur Fortress. If our Legions have captured the fortress, then the captives will have been freed. But if the Asmodians or the Balaur are in control, you'll need to go ahead with your mission.</p>
