          <p>The Blue Pearls you brought me were a great comfort. I spent hours sifting them through my fingers, staring into their shining depths.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But somehow, it was not enough to simply possess them. They, like I, were sitting idle, letting sorrowful thoughts swirl around them rather than doing something constructive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I had an idea: perhaps I can heal my broken heart by making something with Blue Pearls.</p>

          <p>I agree. Thus I've decided to create a grand dress and matching jewelry from Blue Pearls.</p>
