          <p>Ah, I have an idea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If the Test Subject and scientists came from Heiron to go to research lab in the north, they must need a key.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe the ordinary Alquimia researchers don't have keys to the lab, but a high-ranking Lepharist official might have one. Don't you think?</p>
