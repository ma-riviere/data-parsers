          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. I must pose a question. Not rhetorical, mind you, but an honest-to-Ariel question. You've seen your share of battles, so you will understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See this armor I am wearing? And see that sack of grain over there? Which do you think would better hold up to a sword's blade?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, the answer is not what sheathes my body. With the lack of supplies in this wasteland, even one of Senir's dried fish could puncture my armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since we have no steel or chain or even leather around here, I'm forced to make repairs with cloth. Can you believe that?</p>

          <p>Ha ha ha. Precisely, Daeva. That brings me to my point. I overheard a returning patrol say that Nacre Scales are as strong as a rock and as slick as an eel's belly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you heard that, too? Anyway, I want to try and repair my armor using some of those scales. It should work. But with the current state of these dilapidated threads I have on, I fear even sneezing too loud.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May I shamelessly ask you to find me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3520a]s for my armor? I will pay you for your trouble.</p>

          <p>Five scales of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Criton_41_An] should do the trick. Try and find the most attractives ones, won't you?</p>

          <p>Do not fret, Daeva. But if you should see an injured soldier with a dried fish stuck in his chest, you'll know you could have prevented it.</p>
