          <p>Sitting here, I have a lot of time to think about tactics and the psychology of warfare. Do you know how many times the appearance of one commander has turned the tide of battle?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A heroic figure like that, with some experience under their belt, can inspire their troops to greater feats. Great when they're on your side. When they're on the enemy's side, well...</p>

          <p>Yes, of course that is our goal. However, most balk in the face of such power, or, worse, try reckless strategies that lead them to a sorry end. There are very few Daevas who can pull it off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're one of the few.</p>

          <p>Our mission is to take out the Generals of the Elyos Army. Are you up to it?</p>

          <p>And, you know, if you have to cut a swath through the Elyos forces to get to these Generals, that's not such a bad thing, either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't get so arrogant as to think you can take on this challenge by yourself. The Elyos Generals will be surrounded by allies; you should take yours, as well.</p>
