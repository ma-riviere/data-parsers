          <p>The Lifeform Remodeling Report is giving up a few of its secrets, [%username]. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a little confused, however, about the roles of Drana and Dragel in the remodeling process. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I really need are some high-quality samples.</p>

          <p>I know you've been through a lot already, [%username], but it should be obvious why I can't go. Me against the Balaur? A very short expedition.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much! Those samples will be a tremendous help to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It says here that Kobolds and Fungies have been transformed with Dragel, so I'm guessing you'll find traces of it in their bodies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur may have samples, too. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they do.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Think of it--the Balaur able to alter living creatures. What could they do? Where would it stop? </p>

          <p>Yes! Exactly what I need. Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now my research can get underway in earnest. We'll get to the bottom of how the Balaur mutate living creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's possible I'll need other samples from you in future, of course....</p>
