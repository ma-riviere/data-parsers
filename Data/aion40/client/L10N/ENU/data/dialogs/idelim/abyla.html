          <p>Well, anyway, thanks for the rescue. I never thought I'd get out of there. So uh...when I said ANYTHING....</p>

          <p>What's there to think about? We'll be much safer together. The Mosqua's Nest is riddled with all manner of foul insects.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a Cleric, and I'm sure that I can be of assistance. I won't ask for a thing in return. You saved me, after all.</p>
