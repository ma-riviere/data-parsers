          <p>Oh! I'm very glad to see you again, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After you thinned out the Rynoces and Drynacs, I realized that worrying about the animals was the only thing that kept my mind of the unbearable heat and supply shortages! Well, them and Kibelle, but she's got to attend to her duties too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, that doesn't matter, because it seems there were more of the beasts hiding out in the hills. They're a pain in the tail-feathers!</p>

          <p>They attacked a convoy of wagons that was bringing fresh food to us. Several people were hurt, and the locals won't bring up more supplies until we can assure them that the animals have been put down again. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't think I have to tell you how badly we need those supplies, but we simply can't leave the post undefended while we chase beasts across the rocks and dirt. Could I impose on you to lend us a hand exterminating [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Rhinoce_35_An]es and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Driton_35_An]s again?</p>
