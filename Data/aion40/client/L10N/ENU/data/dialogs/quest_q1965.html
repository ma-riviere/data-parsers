          <p>(This is an ornate Titanium Sword. It is perfectly weighted. The handle is lavishly decorated, and the blade itself is keen and seems to sing as you swing it.)</p>

          <p>(On the handle is a small tag that reads "Supply to: Reshanta Teminon Fortress.")</p>

          <p>(It appears you have received this sword by mistake. The intended recipient is presumably still waiting for it in the Abyss. Perhaps you should take it to Supply Officer [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Clatanan] at the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_AB1] in Reshanta.)</p>

          <p>We're running low on weapons, on armor...on everything we need! I've sent word to Sanctum pleading for more supplies, but we can't expect to hear back for days...maybe weeks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're now offering rewards to those who donate their own supplies to us. Imagine that! One of the most critical outposts of our entire war effort, and we have to turn to the populace for help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a sorry state of affairs, make no mistake. Now you've arrived, no doubt looking to see what you can scrounge off us....</p>

          <p>My apologies, [%userclass]! I have seen Daeva after Daeva come here and take the dregs of our supplies from us, even in the face of our most vocal complaints. I expected you to do the same, and I was clearly wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This blade is extraordinarily fine! This is exactly the type of weapon we've been crying out for, and yet when it is brought, it is not by our noblemen or wealthy societies, but by a lone [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you, friend. Thank you.</p>
