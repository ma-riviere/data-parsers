          <p>You young people. Always rushing back and forth. So restless, so energetic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I remember when I was your age. I even fought in the Abyss for a few mortal lifetimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll feel differently soon enough, young one. There comes a time in a Daeva's life where action isn't the focus anymore. You get used to being immortal and want to pull back, enjoy your time.</p>

          <p>Yes, it is. How perceptive! It's so peaceful here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I want a bit of a workout, I go to the Coliseum. If I hunger for a bit of knowledge or adventure, I read in the Library of the Sages. And if I start to miss military life, I swap impossible stories over ale at the Dionysia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, military life. I wonder how my old legion-mates are doing? Ever since we got back from the Abyss, we've been living in different places. Now that I'm thinking about it.... Would you happen to be heading to Theobomos? I'd like to write a letter to an old friend.</p>
