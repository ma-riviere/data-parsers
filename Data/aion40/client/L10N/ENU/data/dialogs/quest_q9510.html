          <p>Welcome, [%username]. Thank you for coming on such short notice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum keeps track of all Daevas dispatched to other areas so we can find Daevas with superior ability when we need them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your recent achievements in Verteron are worthy of an expert Guardian, and with the blessings of the five Seraphim Lords, I will now tell you how to reach the next level.</p>

          <p>You may have heard of [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA31]s in your travels. The principle behind Stigma is not so simple as learning a new skill from a stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To use an ability properly, you must share the memory of a Daeva sealed within the Stigma Stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is why Daevas unskilled in handling Aether cannot use Stigma. They simply cannot relate to the soul inside.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], seek out [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Orphe], who will help you to listen to the souls in the Stigma Stones.</p>

          <p>She can be found in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA29]. Use the elevator inside [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA36] to get there.</p>

          <p>To use a Stigma Stone, you must share your memory with the soul inside it.</p>

          <p>But you know this, since Jucleas must have shared the basics with you.</p>

          <p>The souls within belong to Daevas who vanished in the Abyss during the Millennium War.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While we cannot truly die, Daevas cannot resurrect without an Obelisk or Protective Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Aetheric Field was lifted, the Balaur attacked. They struck down many Daevas, whose souls were absorbed into surrounding objects.</p>

          <p>Yes. The souls inside have only memories of the past and no will of their own.  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must use Aether to synchronize your energy with that of the soul in the Stone to share these memories. This is called a "dialog with the soul."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you succeed, you can borrow power from the Stigma Stone to do things you can't normally do. But this sharing has limits--only the most capable Daevas can handle multiple Stigma.</p>
