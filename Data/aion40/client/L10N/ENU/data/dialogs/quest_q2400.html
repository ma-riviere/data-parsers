          <p>Have you met Vali, a Daeva of Plants stationed in Alsig Village? He's exceptionally devoted to the land, but I'm not really sure what to make of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He did me a favor a while ago, but rejected any reward--he just wanted to know how to farm around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm no farmer, you know? Sentinels protect. It's what we do. Still, I'd like to repay his kindness...</p>

          <p>Vali used to collect samples of animals and plants around Morheim for his research. But lately, he seems content to stay in the village and think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Fall Road is nearly unique in Asmodae--a living reminder of a time when Atriea was whole. Plants, animals, and even spirits are essentially as they were before the Cataclysm. Especially Sparkies and Kalgolems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we could find out how they've avoided mutating over the centuries, wouldn't that be helpful to Tripeed farming?</p>

          <p>We each have our strengths. A Sentinel like myself can't go winging off whenever she wants to. But a Daeva like you...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you collect samples of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpakyD_35_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SouledstoneD_35_An]s along the Fall Road and take them to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Vali]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know how, but the more I think about it, the more I believe they'll be helpful for Tripeed farming. For your troubles, I could give you the reward Vali didn't want. In fact, I think he's still got it.</p>

          <p>I see. Perhaps it's too much to ask of a person with no fixed schedule and dubious means.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course. The concerns of starving sentinels are certainly none of your affair.</p>
