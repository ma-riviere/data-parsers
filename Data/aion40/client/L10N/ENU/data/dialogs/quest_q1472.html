          <p>The Shugos, for instance. The Shugos have various groups and tribes. We can sometimes play them off of each other.</p>

          <p>The Black Cloud Traders are particularly interesting. They seem to know a lot of things beyond Elysea.  Which leads me to Ganimerk.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_DF2_14] is a Shugo we hired as a spy among the Black Cloud Traders, but recently we lost contact with him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His last message indicated he was going to the Mau region in Asmodae to collect information. But, given what we know about him, we're a little worried.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to find him as soon as possible. For our protection, not for his. If the Asmodians buy him out, he would betray us for money. </p>

          <p>It wasn't a useful place to uncover important information, so why was he there in the first place? Probably he was lying about the information, just looking to profit.</p>
