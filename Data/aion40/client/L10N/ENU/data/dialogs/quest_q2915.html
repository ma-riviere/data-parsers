          <p>I'm snowed under with customers--which is good, obviously--but I don't have enough help! What am I supposed to say to the customers? "Sorry, no grub at the famous Apellbine Tavern because Daevas consider cooking beneath them."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is there a chance, any chance, you could rustle up some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shell_d_n_c_10a]s and roast a batch for this hungry crew? If you can I'll make it well worth your time.</p>

          <p>Terrific! Roast Conide is an Asmodian favorite...and it keeps the customers thirsty. And not only don't I have staff to cook it, I'm out of the primary ingredients.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are plenty of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_shell_d_n_c_10a]s in Altgard. You'll need salt. You can use the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF3_Cook_production] in the Temple of Artisans. Just don't get on Lainita's bad side...she'll pluck you, stuff you, and roast you...possibly in that order.</p>
