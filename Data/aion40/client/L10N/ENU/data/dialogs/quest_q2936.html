          <p>[%username], your work these days is really quite outstanding. It seems like just yesterday you first learned your basic skills, and here you are producing work to rival a Master's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alas, my work is done. I can teach you no more.</p>

          <p>It is customary in Pandaemonium for experts to be recognized as such. It's both a mark of honor and a certification of competence.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those who've achieved the greatest expertise in Tailoring are granted the formal title of 'Tailoring Expert.' That's the title I propose you should be granted, [%username].</p>
