          <p>Did you hear that Lepharist Revolutionaries have occupied the Mystic Spring?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The whole of Eltnen is shriveling up, and now they control the only source of water!? Dastardly brutes!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's also a rumor that they were planning to attack the Observatory in Verteron, and I'm worried that they might get up to similar tricks here in Eltnen.</p>

          <p>I may be just a Soul Healer, but I'll put on my armor and fight to the death, if it comes to that.</p>

          <p>I even ordered some armor from an Armorsmithing Expert in Sanctum. No use being prepared to fight if you can't defend yourself, right?</p>

          <p>Well no. It's not here yet. I wrote and asked him whether he was done yet, but he wrote back saying that he had trouble getting the materials. He even asked if I knew any good sources, just to speed things up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thing is, I do know of a good source of platinum, but I can't go and get it myself because I'm on duty. What would happen if someone needed me here, and I was off running around the landscape?</p>

          <p>Soul Healer Tanis was worried that Lepharist Revolutionaries might attack the Observatory, so he ordered some armor from an Armorsmith in Sanctum. Sadly, the Armorsmith didn't have sufficient materials to finish the order.</p>

          <p>You dug up Platinum Ore for Tanis to send to Sanctum so that he could have his armor at last.</p>
