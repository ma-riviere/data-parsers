          <p> </p>
          <p>This is most...unusual. If genuine, it is unlike anything I have seen before. The language, at least, I do recognize--it is Ancient Atreian.</p>

          <p>Let me see it in full light..."Aion, in his omnipotence, must--"...that is all. At that point, the tablet is broken.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Must what? Must be destroyed? Obeyed? I cannot tell. But I suspect it is a historical text, concerning the legend of the First God. It is historically significant, certainly. Sad that the text is so short. I can tell almost nothing from it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will wrap it carefully and send it to Sanctum. That is what the Five would want. If we are meant to discover more, I am sure we shall do so in time.</p>

          <p>You found a fascinating stone fragment in the pocket of a dead Krall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One side was covered with strange script while the other side showed a priest adoring an unseen deity. You sought the advice of Selene, a Priest in Verteron Citadel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She told you that it was a fragment of a historical text, perhaps the tale of the First God, and because it was a valuable artifact, she would send it to Sanctum.</p>
