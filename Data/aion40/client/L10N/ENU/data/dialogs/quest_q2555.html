          <p>Gah! Fine! Yes, Huarinrinerk has stolen Malek from the Mine before, but better to have nice Shugo selling Malek than nasty Lepharists using it, yes?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Huarinrinerk will tell you something though, something Daeva wants to know. Malek Mine boss is angry, strong man named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LehparKnSupervisorNmdDQ_37_Ae]. Kill him, and the others will be lost!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Big name in Shugo circles too, yes. Think of the fame [%username] would enjoy if they were to kill Yotunmork...think of the Kinah! Want to try, Daeva? Want to try and claim Yotunmork's head?</p>
