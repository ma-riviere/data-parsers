          <p>Ah, I'm glad you're here, [%username]! I was just about to summon you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received an order from the Temple of Wisdom, but it's actually an order for Randet, not me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It must have been delivered here by mistake. A lot of our best Daeva couriers are fighting in the Abyss War, and the replacements are finding Morheim...inhospitable to the traveler, I guess you could say.</p>

          <p>Indeed they do--provided our couriers survive the tests that Morheim imposes. Apparently this last courier was too busy surviving to read the name on the orders. C'mon...."Bolverk" and "Randet" don't even look alike!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In any case, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Randet] is in Brusthonin. Could you head there and deliver it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While you're there, you should see if there's anything you can do to help them out. They're even more short-handed than we are.</p>

          <p>Here you are. It's an order from the Temple of Wisdom. Routine stuff, probably.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Randet] is at the Settlers Campsite in Brusthonin. Go there and deliver it.</p>

          <p>And unless you really crave a long journey, ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Orhe], the Teleporter, to send you to Brusthonin. Much faster that way.</p>

          <p>I'm disappointed, [%username]. I chose you because you're so reliable, and now you refuse such a...routine request?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only that, but this delivery was your chance to make a good impression on the Temple of Wisdom.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Temple of Wisdom is better a friend than a rival...</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You delivered the order from the Temple to Randet at the Settlers Campsite in Brusthonin. She was very grateful.</p>
