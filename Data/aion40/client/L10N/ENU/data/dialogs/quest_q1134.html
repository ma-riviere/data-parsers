          <p>I think it's something in the water. It's foul!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are too many animals nesting in the water! Hunters from the citadel used to cull them regularly, but nobody bothers anymore! Now the Airons and Slinks are paddling around in the water, leaving half-eaten things rotting at the bottom. Yuck!</p>
