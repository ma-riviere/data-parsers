          <p>Heiron is in trouble--the Balaur have invaded through an Abyss Gate, and now mutants are showing up, adding to the confusion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Centurion Klaus has told us not to get distracted, but to concentrate on defending the Observatory. I can't help feeling anxious, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And while all this is going on, the Kerubiels are causing problems....</p>

          <p>Well, they didn't used to come this close. Now all of a sudden, they're coming in droves to the Observatory, making all sorts of racket.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's troubling for those of us on duty, but none of the Guardians can leave their posts--we have to guard the Observatory.</p>

          <p>That's an understatement! We need someone who's free to take care of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Cherubim3_32_An]s.</p>
