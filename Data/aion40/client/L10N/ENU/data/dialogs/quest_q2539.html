          <p>There's an alchemist in Morheim named [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kistig]. He's not in hiding or anything--you should be able to find him without much trouble.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you find him, tell him--and this is important, say these words exactly--"The shadow came to Beluslan."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That may not make any sense to you, but trust me, it will to him. Kistig will know what to do next. And he may need your help. But don't talk to anyone--not even your Archon of Dusk--about this.</p>
