          <p>Alsig Village seems quiet, but it's a trouble magnet. It started with Deltras and the Elyos, and it's not slowing down. Our Archons and the Watch protect the villagers from the Lepharists and Mau.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there's a new menace: Klaws scuttling around, south of Alsig Crossroad. A while back a scout killed a Klaw Spy near there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's far from their usual haunts, and cold swamp's not their preferred habitat.</p>

          <p>Recently we've seen more of them. Yeah, enough to threaten us. I checked personally. Looks like they're setting up a second habitat there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I'd scoured the area when the first one was reported... But it's not too late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are only [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2D_34_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1D_34_An]s, not Queen Klaw or workers. It's not a full hive yet.</p>

          <p>We have to expel them before the Queens arrive. It's not late, but there's no time to spare either!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even one Queen in there, and the nest will grow out of control. We'd have to abandon Alsig.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL2D_34_An]s and  [%dic:STR_DIC_M_NeutL1D_34_An]s south of the village, and the Klaws will abandon the new nest.</p>
