          <p>That Odium-studded trinket you brought back is significant without a doubt, but tells us little about the Krall's plans.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy or no, the Krall are still attacking the citadel. We must weaken their offensive by striking hard.</p>

          <p>Well, reconnaissance comes first, as always. Go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA23] and look for any further clues for what the Krall are plotting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you manage to find anything significant, eliminate the Crack Tursin Trackers. They're the backbone of the Krall force...one I intend for you to break.</p>

          <p>Kraka has a lair nearby? And they seemed to be hiding something in it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is grave news. I fear they intend to open a passage to the Abyss, just as they did in Akarios Village. Then the Odium necklace is a tool...one for opening portals....</p>
