          <p>Hail Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have some work for you. Grabakr is a talented Daeva of Minerals. He was dispatched from Pandaemonium to do a geological survey and discover resources useful to crafters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He sent me a letter asking for permission to investigate the Eastern Shard of Latesran.</p>

          <p>Governor Votan ordered me to gather information on the feasibility of such a survey from Daevas who work in the Eastern Shard of Latesran and then report back to him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I have no Legionaries to spare. I cannot afford to lose a good sword for a fact-finding mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take care of this for me, [%username].</p>

          <p>Excellent. Go find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Duneyr] in the lower Eastern Shard of Latesran and ask his opinion. He has been stationed there longer than anyone else--he'll know if it's possible to send out a survey team.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that, go to the upper layer and ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Fias]; then, find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grabakr] in the Asteria Plain and deliver the answer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Both will oppose the survey. They'd never let a Daeva go exploring into enemy territory, especially one unsuited to battle. I know Pandaemonium needs resources, but they may just have to accept that war is war.</p>

          <p>You're probably right. This is no time to explore for mineral resources. The Daevas guarding those places will never let someone explore alone, and we can't spare an escort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pandaemonium will just have to accept that now is not the time. Now, go back to your work.</p>

          <p>But I suspect there's some trouble brewing in the upswing of Elyos movements. Even if that Daeva of Minerals did make it here he might not be able to investigate--there are too many Elyos in the area just waiting to take down an unsuspecting Asmodian.</p>

          <p>The Abyss is a fascinating place to the Daevas of Minerals. The land is rich not only in Aether but also in minerals--some of the rarest in Atreia. If only I could...well that's just my passion. Now I'm focusing on what Pandaemonium needs. Although, if I could  do just one survey, I'm sure I could find something precious!</p>

          <p>These Archons do not understand the importance of these resources! All they think of is fighting to expand territories...I know there's more to Reshanta than constant battle. Well, it looks like I'll be stuck here for a while.</p>

          <p>You met Duneyr and Hwiath and asked their opinions. Both of them believed that the current conditions are unsafe for a geological survey. When you delivered their message, Grabakr said it was what he had expected.</p>
