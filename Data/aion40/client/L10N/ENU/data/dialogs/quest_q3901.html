          <p>Noble [%username], I have a task I would ask of you. I need you to deliver a book for me--an Esoteric Book of Justice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This tome holds little for you now as it was the heart of your early training. The next tome, on the other hand...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a simple task, but I daren't entrust just anyone with something this valuable.</p>

          <p>It's gratifying to see a [%userclass] advancing in rank. All too many of our brothers and sisters... Well, you know.</p>
