          <p>The dark fire of jealousy devours all in its path, as the older generation likes to say. So I'd appreciate it if you'd help me out with this one.</p>

          <p>Yes, exactly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if I had enough Basilisk Leather to craft new armor for everyone, we could avoid that scale-slick situation.</p>
