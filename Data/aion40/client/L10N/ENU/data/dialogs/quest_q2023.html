          <p>If you head north from the village, you'll find the Lepharists' den near Idun's Lake.</p>

          <p>The den isn't much to speak of really, just a fence, a wooden barricade and some worn-out warehouses, but it's still their main base here.</p>

          <p>Sigh.... Mosbears and the Lepharists.... Why is it that we have so much trouble here around Basfelt Village?</p>

          <p>We will have to kill the cell leader. That would definitely demoralize the rest of the rebels, and maybe they'll find someone else to pester..</p>
