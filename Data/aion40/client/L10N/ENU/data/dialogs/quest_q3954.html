          <p>How about making Fasimedes' Noble Spellbook?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can make it, I'll know you deserve to be an Alchemy Expert. It was the test given to me when I became an Expert.</p>

          <p>Every Alchemy Expert should be able to make Fasimedes' Noble Spellbook. Are you talented enough to try?</p>

          <p>You can buy the Fasimedes' Noble Spellbook design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Darius]. It's usually on the shelf next to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1981] design.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not easy to make, but I did it on my third try.</p>
          <p> </p>
