          <p>Tell me, [%username]--how long has it been since you ascended?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's not really important, but of all the Daevas here, I am the oldest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've learned quite a few things in that time. How to earn some extra Kinah, for instance.</p>

          <p>It's like this. Every posting has at least one or two specialty goods that can be sold at a higher price somewhere else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, It's [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1402a]. The hides of Granite Gorgons sell very well in Sanctum as an ideal armor material.</p>

          <p>You're a curious sort, aren't ya? What more do you need to know besides Kinah, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would think you need a lot to keep you in all that fancy armor and weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just head up to the Geroch Caldera and bring me Granite [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1402a]s. I'll make sure you're taken care of--you can trust old Makis in matters of Kinah.</p>

          <p>Great. Two things to remember:</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First, the Granite Gorgon has a huge horn. Never take your eyes off it, and you shouldn't have any problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Second, the deal is for three [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1402a]s. I'm not so old I can't count, and three's what it takes to make a sale.</p>
