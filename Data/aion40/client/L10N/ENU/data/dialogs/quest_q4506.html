          <p>Thank you for before. As I thought, Brigade General Nerita was full of praise for our work with the Mamut problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He heard of it from the Mau before I reported to him. He said they were grateful for my foresight. He also said I played an important role in strengthening our alliance.</p>

          <p>Now he wants me to continue to work to help the Mau. They want to conduct further expeditions to the Mamut Graveyard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But like last time, my duties compel me to remain here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could kill more [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteD_41_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteSmallD_41_An]s, the Mau, the Brigade General, and I would be very grateful.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Apparently, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteD_41_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MammothWhiteSmallD_41_An]s have increased in number once more.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just remember, the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_STR_DF3_SZ_D3] is crawling with Mamut Souls at night, so going by day will be better.</p>

          <p>I understand. Like me, you have your own duty to fulfill. I'll always be grateful for you helping me get the Brigade General's attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, if you find time to help, it will benefit many, not just me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be warned, though: now that the Daevas here have heard of what we did, there will be more competition at the Mamut Graveyard soon.</p>

          <p>It's not just Brigade General Nerita who's been paying more attention to me. Other Daevas here have begun giving me more respect as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not sure if they're impressed with me, or if they're trying to draw favor from the Brigade General. I guess that's one of the drawbacks of power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's not your problem. How did the Mamut hunt go? </p>

          <p>This isn't much, but it comes with much gratitude behind it. Please return if you're able to give more assistance.</p>
