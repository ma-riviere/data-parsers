          <p>I threw the jewelry into the lake behind me. I won't keep any presents from that creep. But now...I hear my husband Tekor is in deep financial trouble with...guess who? Balom!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to sell the pieces of jewelry and help Tekor, but I can't find them! I'm afraid the Plumas, Crasaurs and Slinks of the lake must have eaten them. </p>

          <p>Would you recover the jewelry for me, Daeva?</p>
