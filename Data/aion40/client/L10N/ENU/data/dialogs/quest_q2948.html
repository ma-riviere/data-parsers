          <p>My name is Huron, and I'm a representative of the 9th Pandaemonium Research Center!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to outfit you with one of our fabulous new models! With their wonderfully wide wingspan and specially tuned feathers, they'll make flying fun again!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And they're sure to be a big hit with girls like me, or guys like I would be if I was a guy--depending on your preference!</p>
