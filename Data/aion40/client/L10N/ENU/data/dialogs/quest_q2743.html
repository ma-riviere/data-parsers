          <p>Ohh, all this senseless pain and sorrow makes me think that life is sweet, bbbut fleeting.</p>

          <p>What misery it must be for one bound eternally to this world, not dead, yet not living either....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas should rejoice to have purpose! They should thank the Shedim Lords and Humans for the chance to serve. Returning these lost souls to the flow of Aether is the kindest blessing I can give. Pppeace to the restless dddead!</p>

          <p>It grieves me to see these souls wander the Grave of Steel when they should be a pppart of all.</p>

          <p>Lllook at the Fallen Warriors wandering here. Even transformed, they are still obsessed with desire and longing for things they may never have again.</p>

          <p>Their misplaced pppassions drive them to despicable acts of mayhem and carnage. Will you help me liberate them from their dddesires [%username]?</p>
