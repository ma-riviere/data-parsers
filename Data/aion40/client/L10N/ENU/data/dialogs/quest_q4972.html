          <p>Oh goodness, [%username], what's a man to do now?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Two of the three judges I invited turned me down. I need able replacements...and fast! I never expected that silly goose Phyper to run out on me. I just hope he's passing on this for a good reason, and not just another damsel in distress... He's such a cliche sometimes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, there's still time before the contest to figure this out. But as luck would have it, I thought this might happen, and I have a plan. </p>

          <p>I had an inkling that Eiren might refuse. He can be such a prude, and I know he doesn't appreciate costumes as much as he should.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he's a talented veteran of the trade, and he would have made a fabulous judge. However, his assistant, Lark, might be just the one we need to fill his shoes. She's been Eiren's assistant for as long as I can remember, and I'm sure she knows a thing or two about fashion. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you mind doing me another favor, [%username]? I promise it'll be quick!</p>

          <p>Now, I'm sure you would have preferred something a little more "personal" as thanks, but with the contest just ahead I'm afraid I'm too busy.</p>

          <p>Please accept this! It's not much, but I think you will like it. Be sure to come back and see me after the contest, [%username], and I'll give you a more "fitting" reward. Don't be a stranger now!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Lark accepted the offer with great enthusiasm, and Daskin gave you a gift as thanks for your help.</p>
