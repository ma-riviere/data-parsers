          <p>I didn't think this moment would come so soon, but there's no denying it has arrived.</p>

          <p>You are far more experienced now than you were when you first ascended. Your courage is proven, your expertise respected.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's high time you prepared yourself for the challenge ahead of you. I speak, of course, of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Understand this...the Abyss is like nothing you have seen before. It is a place of horror, insanity, and lethal violence. Before you can travel there, you must be tested.</p>

          <p>I hope you do. Up to now you've faced Sapiens and Lepharists, but in the Abyss you'll be up against beings as powerful as yourself. Elyos Daevas--and of course the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To prepare you to face other Daevas, we have a Coliseum. I'm sending you to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Therf] to learn what you need to know, and receive practical instruction in duelling. Now go.</p>

          <p>Ah, more qualification tests? Well, if you want to survive in the Abyss, you should hone your skills fighting your fellow Daevas here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Elyos infest the Abyss. You might encounter whole phalanxes of them, or you could run into a lone skirmisher while carrying out a mission.</p>

          <p>Blood for blood! That's why you have to practice and prepare yourself. Battle in the Abyss isn't clean and it isn't civilized. When you encounter the enemy your combat reactions have to be second nature.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At this arena, everyone fights. Choose any of the Daevas here and fight a duel with them.</p>

          <p>When you think you've practiced as much as you can for today, go back to see High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Balder].</p>
