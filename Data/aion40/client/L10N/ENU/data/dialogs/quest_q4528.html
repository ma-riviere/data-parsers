          <p>RM-78c. It's such an innocuous set of letters and numbers, isn't it? You'd never expect it to be a monstrosity out of your worst nightmares.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lepharists in Elysea are responsible for it. I have no idea how they did it, or what it was before...if it was ever even Human.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if the things I've heard are true, it's a fearsome, savage creature. It smells like a slaughterhouse but kills like a Drakan.</p>

          <p>Certainly does. I've heard many more stories about it than you, young Daeva, stories that would curdle your insides to just hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The existence of this thing offends my very soul. I don't think I can ever rest easy as long as it still exists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've decided that I must do something about it, somehow. My first step: ask strong Daevas like you to destroy it, once and for all.</p>

          <p>Ah, I feel like you've lifted a great burden from me just by agreeing. The power of hope, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just getting to [%dic:STR_DIC_M_RM78] won't be easy, seeing as how it's in Elysea and all. But I know you can do it.</p>

          <p>Didn't mean to make you feel obligated to me, either. I'm not the kind to tell Daevas to go traipsing off to Elysea on a whim.</p>

          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Disturbed by the thought of the undead creature, created by Lepharists in Elysea, he asked you to find and destroy it.</p>

          <p>You did so and returned to Govanon, who was quite relieved, as he'd just overheard some young Daevas foolishly planning to attack it.</p>
