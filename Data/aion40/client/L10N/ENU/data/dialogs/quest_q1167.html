          <p>I can't abide these filthy Gryphus! Wheeling about, screeching their hideous chatter--it's more than I can bear.</p>       
          <p> </p>
          <p>They swooped down, pecked at us, and tore open our packages. Then they flew off with our provisions. It's been days since we've eaten.</p>

          <p>You have saved us, Daeva. The Abex and Gryphus living nearby shouldn't be too hard to catch, and their meat is tough but highly nourishing.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could bring us 3 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA79] and 5 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA80], I'm certain we'd have the strength to carry on.</p>
