          <p>Why are you still here? Does your heart not hunger for the blood of the Elyos as mine does?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I see. Your silence speaks volumes. You seek to know if I am sated on blood, not whether I could offer more. You are as stubborn as Betoni, aren't you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Myanee...her memory cries out to me still, weeping the tears I no longer have. </p>

          <p>I won't. There's nothing left for me there. My purpose is here...my heart is here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not expect, however, that Betoni will understand. He's as stubborn as the Shedim Lords themselves. It would doubtless be faster for me to persuade him--perhaps then he'd listen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll give you a letter which you can deliver to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Betoni]. Tell him it's my final word on the subject. Will you do this?</p>

          <p>I came to Elysea seeking fame--instead I found love beyond words, and now I desire only blood and silence. How could I return to Asmodae and be at peace? </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell Betoni I serve the Lords in my own way. Every Daeva I transform is one less to fight us. Every life I claim brings us one step closer to victory. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tell him that I'm beyond persuasion. He risks the life of whomever he sends should he continue to press the matter. Thus have I spoken. </p>
