          <p>I needed a new sword, right? So I went to the weapons shop in Verteron Citadel, and I saw this nice dagger with all these pretty gems on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ivis told me I didn't need it but I knew it'd look good on me, so I bought it anyway. It cost me a whole month's wages!</p>

          <p>The problem? I can't cut anything with it 'cause it's too short and too thin.</p>
