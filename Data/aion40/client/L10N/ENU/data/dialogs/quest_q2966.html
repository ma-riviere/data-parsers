          <p>I don't believe it! Thank shadows you found this. It 'shipped' weeks ago. And what did I get? An empty box! Perfect! Yeah, we'll just hide under it and sneak by the Balaur!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hope it's not too late. Balaur don't wait for us to gear up. They're notoriously poor on chivalry.</p>

          <p>You're a good'un, Daeva. Feels like folks back in the world forget about us. Thanks.</p>

          <p>There was a supply tag on the Titanium Sword you received as a reward. It was meant for Reshanta.</p>

          <p>Supplies are tight in the Abyss. After thinking it over, you took the sword to Fyra, a Primum Landing supply solider, a happy surprise since the item's empty box came earlier.</p>
