          <p>Okay, let's start right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My highest record is 10 Mosbears in 30 minutes, so that's what you'll have to beat. Bring back 10 pairs of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_2230a] as proof.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't care what kind of Mosbear it is--any of them will do. If you succeed, I'll admit to everyone that you're the better hunter.</p>

          <p>I'll start the timer the moment you agree.</p>
