          <p>Can you believe this is the third effort to reclaim Brusthonin? Third. Zero-Three. Two failed, one to go. Fascinating, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After the first two attempts failed, people abandoned the place. They figured the land would never be able to support settlers again. Now, it's just deserted--well, except for all the Undead. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I first arrived, I was really surprised. Only the area around Baltasar wasn't contaminated or overrun.</p>

          <p>Oh, yes. Baltasar not only prevents contamination but also keeps undead from invading.</p>

          <p>We couldn't have established ourselves here if not for Ervin's intercession and Baltasar's help.</p>

          <p>Thanks to them, Humans can live here safely and we soldiers can sleep easy knowing this place is protected.</p>

          <p>It is, but Baltasar's power doesn't protect us from every danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kurins and Karnifs in Sudorville, for example--their numbers used to be rather small, but lately they've become a real problem.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, it's a problem that a Daeva could solve easily, now that I think about it. Are you up for it, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Very good. If you go out the north gate of Baltasar Hill Village, you'll see Sudorville.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_CuresSpotD_45_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF2A_KalnifSpotD_45_An]s are all over the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just get rid of them. We've got our hands full with the undead, but these animals are a constant danger to Humans so I appreciate you taking care of it.</p>

          <p>The fact that the Kurins and Karnifs are increasing in numbers isn't all bad. There was a time when not even insects could live here. It's a sign that the area is recovering.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, we still have to deal with them. Did you get rid of some of the Kurins and Karnifs?</p>

          <p>Thank you for your help. Every extra hand is appreciated here in Brusthonin.</p>

          <p>As she requested, you killed Spotted Kurins and Pale Karnifs that were encroaching on the village borders. She was grateful for the help.</p>
