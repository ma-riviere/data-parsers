          <p>O' course, a seafood dinner is the only dinner for a pirate. Landlubbers all think cookin' Lobnite requires drawn Abex Butter, but I know simple Roast Lobnite Pincers goes best with rum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's easy enough to prepare. Ye don't need seasonings--just roast Lobnite Pincers on the fire. Their salty and juicy flesh call for more drink. So, how about Roast Lobnite Pincers for dinner?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not so fast! Cap'n Jackdaw's providin' the drink. So, it would be only fair for ye to be providin' the dinner. Agreed?</p>
