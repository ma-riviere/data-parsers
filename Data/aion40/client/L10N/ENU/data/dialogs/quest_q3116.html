          <p>Have you seen the giant Dimensional Rift in the Observatory Village?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Theobomos area doesn't usually get many rifts, then to get a huge, powerful one like this? It's very odd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're too short-handed to investigate the rift ourselves, so right now we're sending bounty hunters to check it out. [%username], you should go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Klotho] and see if there's anything you can help with.</p>

          <p>I don't know why they've asked us bounty hunters investigate a rift. Fortunately, we've got a newcomer we were able to dump it on. I think his name was Rovilance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He just came back with some story about the rift leads to the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_L_DF2a_entrance]. I don't know if he's right or not, but I work alone. There's no money in this for me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username] you should go see [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rovilance]. You might be better suited to this than me.</p>

          <p>The other bounty hunters keep giving me the assignments they don't want. My work is piling up, and now this rift is making everything worse.</p>

        	<p>Great! It turns out that behind the rift is the entrance to the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Entrance_L_Adma].</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Yes, the one in Asmodae. And now I've been there! My first major assignment as a bounty hunter, and I get this.</p>

          <p>Atropos said told you to help the bounty hunters investigating the Giant Dimensional Rift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you talked to Klotho, he said a novice took over the investigation and sent you to Rovilance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rovilance, who had ventured inside the rift, said that he found the Adma Stronghold on the other side.</p>
