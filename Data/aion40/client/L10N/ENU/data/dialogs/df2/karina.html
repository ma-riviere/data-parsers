          <p>Aktum is the Soul Healer over there. He's Balom's youngest brother. I heard that Balom forced him to learn Soul Healing so he'd bring some prestige to the family. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Aktum doesn't seem to be very smart. It took him years to become a Soul Healer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I work in their house, and Aktum's lack of common sense just makes more work for me. </p>
