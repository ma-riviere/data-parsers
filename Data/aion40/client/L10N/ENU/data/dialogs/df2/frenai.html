          <p>My husband and I managed a small Tripeed farm there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last year, the owner of another farm started harassing us...and making advances on me. My husband sent me to the fortress for my own safety.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I miss Tekor so much. We write. Everyday, I tell him news of the fortress... and I sometimes get letters from him, too. Someday I'll go back.</p>
