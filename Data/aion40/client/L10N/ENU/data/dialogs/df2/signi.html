          <p>The pride of Morheim is Tripeed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without it, Assassins and Rangers would be at a severe disadvantage, so we are rightfully protective of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since I was born and raised in Alsig village, I know a lot about Tripeed. When I was young, I dreamt of owning a Tripeed farm.</p>

          <p>I gave up my dream of having a Tripeed farm when I ascended.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do my best with the jobs I am given, in accordance with the will of the Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But someday if I can leave my position as an Archon, I will go back to my hometown and help people there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think about improving Tripeed seeds. I want to make seeds that are stronger and more hardy.</p>
