          <p>The weather is nice today. Resting with a cool beverage would be the best way to enjoy this day! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like a glass of Fruit Wine from Otis, but I'm afraid...well this is rather embarrassing, but I owe Otis some money and I don't have it. He wouldn't sell me a drink; he'd simply keep the money in payment of some of my debt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you have some time, would you go to Otis and buy a glass of fruit wine for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unless you're busy... </p>

          <p>I understand. It's my problem. </p>
