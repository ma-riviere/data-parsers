          <p>Once, the people of Brusthonin lived in peace and plenty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If they were hungry, they picked fruit straight from the trees. If they were thirsty, they drank from the clear streams. No one wanted for anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then came the Cataclysm, and destruction came to the land. Paradise burned as dragons slaughtered the people of Brusthonin.</p>

          <p>Those that survived fled to Morheim. They found it hard and terrible; too hot or too cold, too barren or too overgrown.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In the end, the survivors of Brusthonin settled in the Salt Desert. Building meager shacks to keep out the stinging winds, they began to rebuild their lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They survived, and grew strong. As their settlement grew into a village, so did they grow into Asmodians.</p>

          <p>When a force of Elyos showed up one night, and survivors of Deltras' expedition begging for mercy and shelter, the villagers could not refuse them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The pitiful Elyos, after all, reminded the villagers so much of their people's own origins--frightened refugees, just looking to survive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They agreed to hide the Elyos from Lord Zikel's patrols, and help them return to Elysea.</p>

          <p>It was not long before Lord Zikel himself appeared in the village, with a regiment of Archons, searching for Deltras' remaining followers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though the villagers protested, the Archons smashed down their doors and searched their homes. They dragged the Elyos out from their hiding places, and executed them in the village square.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lord Zikel, in his anger, decided that the traitorous villagers would be dealt with as well. As they cowered in fear, Lord Zikel waved his hand, and transformed them all into brutish Kentari.</p>

          <p>No one went to the village again. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Travelers passing by said that the transformed villagers still lived there, wandering aimlessly in and out of their former homes, looking at each other and wondering what would become of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One day, the Kentari abandoned the village, leaving their homes to the sand and wind.</p>

          <p>Kentari blood has washed away the kindness of their former lives.</p>

          <p>A traveler once said that he came across a Kentari in the desert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He froze in fear, expecting to be torn limb from limb as the beast approached him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They stood face to face, eye to eye, but when the traveler looked into the Kentari's eyes...</p>

          <p>Then the Kentari turned around, and walked off into the desert winds.</p>
