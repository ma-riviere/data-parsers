          <p>Does Daeva know about Horu? Very clever Daeva, very interested in rocks and minerals and deposition and sediments...very clever! Exactly the kind of Daeva Luurinerk should meet.</p>

          <p>Luurinerk would like to be noticed by him, Daeva. Would like to give him something he hasn't got, yes?</p>

          <p>Luurinerk has seen much of Beluslan, and seen things most haven't. Has seen something Horu would be very interested in--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_MimicAmethystD_34_An], and their backs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Spiky backs, yes? Spiky backs infused with Malek! Very unusual! Very interesting, especially for Daeva like Horu, yes?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You decided to help, and collected several Deformed Malek samples before taking them to Horu. He was very pleased with the samples, and told you he would get in touch with Luurinerk soon.</p>
