          <p>I have great respect for the past, Daeva. The Water Spirits have occupied the lake lands since time immemorial. Their claim to this place is older even than our temple's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have always been honorable beings, yet now their souls seem possessed, as if galvanised to madness, an inexplicable belligerence, lashing out like wounded beasts!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can find no cause of this caprice. I only wish...</p>

          <p>Well, the pilgrims are the obvious victims here. They suffer the attacks of the wild spirits and now even show aggression themselves! The Holy Ground is supposed to be a sanctuary!</p>

          <p>We must take action against the spirits. It pains me to threaten them; just ensure that they abate their violence. I won't have any more Elyos harmed on holy ground! Hunt some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA148]s--cool their blood to douse the flames of their madness.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Aion's Mercy! Take care--only six of the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA148]s shall be put down. Even that is a great shame, but any less and we risk their continued ire. It should serve as an adequate warning. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They wander Miraju's Holy Ground, drifting like ghosts on the winds. Ahh...I wish there were some other...but no. This is the correct action.</p>

          <p>Come to me when your mission is complete, and please, try to kill mercifully.</p>
