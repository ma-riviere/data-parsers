          <p>Well...there's something you don't see every day. Something I ordered actually arriving!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This staff should have come days...no, weeks ago. Archons aren't exactly patient, you know. I'm surprised this place is still in one piece, the number of times I've had to turn them away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, at least it's here now, I suppose. And I've got you to thank. So, erm...thanks. If you happen to see another crate of these, please let me know!</p>
