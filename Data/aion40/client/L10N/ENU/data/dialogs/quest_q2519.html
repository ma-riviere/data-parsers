          <p>Manastone removers meet a lot of people and hear a lot of interesting stories--combat with tough enemies, difficult missions....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course what interests me most is stories about manastones. Many people aren't sure how to manage the ones they can't use.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Well, I may have the answer for you, friend. The Manastone Removers Association is looking to collect unused manastones for research purposes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can exchange certain kinds of manastones for more useful ones. If you bring me HP +50, Accuracy +18, and Block +18 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't you think that's a good idea? If you usually just throw away manastones you don't use, why not just exchange them for a new one?</p>

          <p>Some day, I hope to go to Pandaemonium and study Advanced Manastones.</p>

          <p>Remember, I can only exchange HP +50, Accuracy +18, and Block +18 manastones. It's in the guidelines handed down by the Manastone Removers Association.</p>

 			<p>You've probably heard this before, but if you want, I can make this same deal again.</p>
