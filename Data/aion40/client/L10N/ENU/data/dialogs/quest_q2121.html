          <p>Derot over there isn't filling your head with "women are weak" nonsense, is he? Good. I grow weary of beating sense into him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The rest of the raiders have come a long way. A few years ago they were all men. Ulgorn thought women were too weak, unskilled, and thin-skinned for the kind of work we do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Delle and I joined, we had to disguise ourselves at first. But we proved that we're plenty capable of holding our own. And Ulgorn changed his mind--although his daughter might have had something to do with it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Talk about raider kinship. I spurred Delle on when she was struggling, and Delle did the same for me.</p>

          <p>Apparently not!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's quite a character--once you meet her, you don't forget her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's stationed up at the entrance to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_7]--keeps the ghosts from wandering too far.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's recognized as one of our strongest raiders, so she gets the most dangerous territories.</p>

          <p>Actually, yeah. Last time I spoke to her, she told me her post was all right, but that she isn't getting regular supplies. The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_7] is so far from the Aldelle camp...I suppose it's inevitable that deliveries are few and far between.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2121a] that she could use. Do you mind taking it to her?</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you. She'll definitely appreciate the gift.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One warning, though: The graveyard is a dangerous place to hang about. So be careful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please hurry. You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Erre] near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_7], and you can hand her the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2121a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I expect she'll gladly reward you for your time. Safe travels!</p>

          <p>You should think about the reward, however. Delle is known for her generosity and would undoubtedly pay far more than you deserve for such a simple task.</p>

          <p>Oh [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Mijou], you beauty! She must be a psychic! I grumbled one day about bein' hungry, and the next day, a parcel of food arrives from the Anturoon Crossing. Hah!</p>
