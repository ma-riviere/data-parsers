          <p>We don't get much trouble from the Krall here. It's the Kobolds. They're smaller and faster, and raid our supplies regularly.</p>

          <p>The militia do what they can, but what we really need to do is break the morale of those little shadow-lovers.</p>

        <p>There's one particular Kobold--from what we can tell, he's a folk hero over there.</p>          
        <p> </p>
        <p>They call him Lightningfoot Tuka. He can run fast as...well...lightning, and can dodge just about anything. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Last time he led a raid here, they took all the Porguses before we could even sound the alarm.</p>

          <p>Exactly. We need to show the Kobolds that their hero isn't immortal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It won't be easy. He's so fast you can barely get a swing in before he's out of your reach.</p>
