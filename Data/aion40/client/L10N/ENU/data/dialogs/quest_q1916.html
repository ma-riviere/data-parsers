          <p>To ascend is a divine blessing, Daeva. Cherish this time, but also accept the burden of responsibility that comes with it. Many Daevas have been lost serving Aion and Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmmm...I see no trepidation in your eyes...not even a flicker of fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I see many new Daevas and have grown accustomed to hesitation at this prospect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is something about you, something mature and yet fresh at the same time.</p>

          <p>This is difficult to comprehend. Karamatis is a hive of the Balaur, a beleaguered region of the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What little I know of the Abyss would be enough to instill tremendous caution in anyone approaching that area.</p>

          <p>A Daeva who has lost power and memory, re-rendered into Human form--it's unheard of. I must consult Jucleas to discern the truth of it before we can discuss this further.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I said that grave danger lies ahead--this is the path of the Daeva. Whatever Pernos showed you, for now you must focus on the task at hand.</p>

          <p>Verteron Citadel needs assistance, but before you, there was no one to send. Go quickly.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09] is taking heavy losses against the Tursin Krall. We also hear a group resembling the Lepharist Revolutionaries is active in the area.</p>
