          <p>I don't usually take much interest in [%userclass] affairs, so I hadn't noticed your blossoming skill in making cloth armor. Now that I see your work, I wonder why you spend any time away from this, the noblest of trades!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know, an opportunity has presented itself, [%username], and you may be just the Daeva for the job. This is a chance for cloth armorers to be appreciated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you lend your weight to the cause?</p>

          <p>It's Minon, you see. He's in the Abyss, an unenviable situation to say the least, and he was asked to repair a particularly delicate robe...by a particularly delicate patron.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The robe was in such a desperate state that Minon had to send it to me. I've completed the work, but I can't deliver it to him myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need someone hardened by battle, yet with knowledge of the crafts. What do you say, [%username]? Will you help?</p>

          <p>Thank you! I wish I could see Minon's face when he inspects the robe. It's some of my finest work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here, I've packed it up for you. I hear the Abyss can be very...dirty.</p>

          <p>Please deliver this package as soon as possible. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Minon] will be waiting anxiously!</p>

          <p>This isn't Sanctum, you know. Procuring items in the Abyss can be like stitching with no thread!</p>
