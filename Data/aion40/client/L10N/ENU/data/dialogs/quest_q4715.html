          <p>You've been to the Dredgion, [%username], so you know the Balaur use Surkana as a power source.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our scholars tell us the Surkana needs regular replenishing. It's not--as we thought--a perpetual fuel.</p>

          <p>Sure enough. The scholars' report also indicates that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_DrakanFiSupply_50_Ae] is in charge of replenishing [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3715a] in the Dredgion, though his visits to the ship are infrequent at best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our goal now is to get rid of him and take the Surkanate for study, just as we did when we studied the Core of the Crashed Dredgion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you ready for another mission to the Balaur ship?</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDAb1_Dreadgion_DrakanFiSupply_50_Ae] spends most of his time around Armories No. 1 and No. 2.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But collecting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_3715a] is more important than getting rid of him. We need to learn everything we can about Balaur technology.</p>
