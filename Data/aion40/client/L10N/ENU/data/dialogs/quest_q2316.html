          <p>How often do you suppose great civilizations have collapsed due to a seemingly-minor misstep? I suppose you could say the Tower of Eternity fell because of a careless misstep, if you were inclined to argue the point.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mention this to illustrate the point that I've also lost a large chunk of my research because of such a mistake, although that isn't nearly on par with the fall of a civilization. I can't believe I misplaced the manuscript I've been working on for a dozen years or so!</p>
