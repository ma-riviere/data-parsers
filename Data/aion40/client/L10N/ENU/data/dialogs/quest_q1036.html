          <p>Yes. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anasya] contacted us just moments ago, and it appears a Human woman named Hierni has been kidnapped. You're the finest [%userclass] available, so I'm tasking you with getting her back.</p>

          <p>Travel to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_G1] and  speak with Taera right away. She'll give you any details that are pertinent to the mission at hand, and tell you exactly who this Hierni woman is.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Listen closely Daeva. Hierni is Human, true enough, but unlike any Human I have met. Her capacity for learning is unsurpassed, her geological knowledge is remarkable and she learned the Krallic tongue in a matter of months.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was a combination of these two passions of hers that landed her in trouble, actually. We believe the Krall are using her to pinpoint mineral veins throughout Eltnen.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Hurry, friend. Hierni may be safe for now, but she had been travelling with a group of Krall, followers of a huge creature named Mabangtah. If any of Mabangtah's Krall are still alive, then you should rescue them too!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He and his followers are currently friendly towards us, but should any of his men end up killed then the whole region could turn into a bloodbath. Go!</p>

He ordered you to see Taera, a lone Sentinel guarding the Outpost Ruins, listen to the details of the abduction, and rescue Hierni. You travelled to the Kaidan Mine and successfully rescued the Human, though she asked you to save one of Mabangtah's Krall, a creature named Gardugu, at the same time.</p>

          <p>You found Gardugu, and offered to rescue him. However, he refused, claiming that his escape would only endanger Elder Mabangtah. He handed you a ring instead, and asked you to deliver it to the Krall chief for him. You then went to Mabangtah, who asked you to deliver a letter to the General Telemachus stating that he intended to cooperate with the Elyos. You delivered the letter to Telemachus, and received his heartfelt thanks for your efforts.</p>
