          <p>[%username], this is a surprise!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I received word that a skilled [%userclass] was coming to help us, but I wasn't expecting you. You've made a favorable impression upon many, it seems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, hear that? The Dukaki Kobolds are hacking down trees in the forest. Apparently, one of the Elim has been harassing Ampeis to do something about it.</p>

        	<p>Why? We both need the wood the forest supplies, and while we work with the Elim to sow seeds as we chop limited amounts of trees, the Dukaki have been cutting through vast swathes of the woodland.</p>
        	<p> </p>
          <p>It's not like the Dukaki to be so well organized, [%username]. It's time to let them know that we're not going to stand for this. We've already planned out our attack, but if you want to head to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07] first and soften the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA137] there up, you'll make things much easier for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The question is, do you want to help?</p>

          <p>Back already? Well, no time for congratulations. We've made a discovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently, the Dukaki are more than just a bunch of organized lumberjacks--they're trying to refine [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA19]! I can't believe it took us so long to catch on! We need to inform Captain Kalio.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Oh, right! I heard you bumped your head. Odium is an ore infused with Aether, the substance empowering the Seraphim Lords and our [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09]s. It's incredibly powerful!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worse yet, we've learned that the Tursin Krall are behind the Dukaki's activities. If they've managed to manipulate Aether, then all of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LF1_name] is at risk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], I need you to head back to the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA07] immediately and kill some [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA139]es.</p>

          <p>I've already sent word on to Captain Kalio--he'll decide how to proceed with the Krall.</p>
