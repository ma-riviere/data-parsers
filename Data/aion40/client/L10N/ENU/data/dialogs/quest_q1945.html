          <p>You have studied hard to reach your current level. It's only fair that your achievements be recognized. We alchemists must ensure that our contributions do not go unnoticed--after all, who else will stick up for us?</p>

          <p>To reach the highest level of achievement in the school of alchemy is to merit the title of Alchemy Expert.</p>
