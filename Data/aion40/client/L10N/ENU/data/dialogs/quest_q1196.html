          <p>Do you know about Iron Coins, [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>There are several tasks that our Guardians are unable to complete, usually due to time constraints. These tasks get assigned Iron Coin status, meaning that the reward for the tasks is not ordinary Kinah or supplies, but one of these coins instead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our Daevas can then complete several of these tasks, collect Iron Coins, then hand them in for rewards.</p>

          <p>I do. It involves the Holy Ground here. The spirits that inhabit this haven of Aether have recently changed. They have become aggressive when before they were peaceful and calm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Something must be done. We have sent Guardians who successfully eliminated many of the spirits, but still the spirits return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum finally agreed that the situation warrants Iron Coin status. Perhaps this is work you'd be interested in, [%username]?</p>
