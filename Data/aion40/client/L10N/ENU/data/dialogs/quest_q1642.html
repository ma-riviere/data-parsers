          <p>There's a lot we don't know about this area, but one thing's clear: Heiron's a hive for the undead. The question is--why?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My research suggests they rise for one of several different reasons--but why here and why now, I don't know.</p>

          <p>Well, for one thing, it'll tell us more about how to eliminate them. And it may explain what happened here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nolantis and Medeus Manor both suffered regional disasters. They're swarming with the undead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anubite Fighters are particularly interesting. Unlike other undead, I can't find any reason they're here at all. And every time I go to Nolantis Ruins, I end up gasping beside an Obelisk. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on soul healing.</p>

          <p>You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Skeleton_43_An]s on the road between Nolantis Ruins and Ortin Farm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could get their personal effects for me, I can learn who these soldiers were and what their mission was. I think 15 should be enough.</p>
