          <p>Ah, is there no end to this? This dangerous creature, that dangerous creature, this threat defeated...it's enough to make a soldier wish for retirement. And now Viragos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you know, they are so violent that the residents are afraid to set foot outside the village. The Virago leader is very strong, and they take inspiration from their leaders so it makes the entire pack of them strong.</p>

          <p>Well, we may not be able to hunt down all of the Viragos, but killing the leader would certainly break their morale.</p>

          <p>There's a group of Viragos just outside the gate Letum and Securis are guarding. Head southeast from there. Get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_HarpyReDNamed_35_An], their leader.</p>

          <p>Hey! Hold on now, there's more you should know. Don't just wander off like that. Shards and blast, Daeva!</p>

          <p>Harfuia seldom appears. She usually stays in the hideout so she is very hard to catch.Be patient and you will see her.</p>
