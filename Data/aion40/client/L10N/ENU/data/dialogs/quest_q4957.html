          <p>Just recently, a Daeva who'd been fabricating something on the alchemist's table suddenly screamed, kicked the table, smashed his orbs, and ran shouting from the hall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked Grad what the fuss was. He said the poor bloke had been working on Honir's Noble Spellbook but couldn't master it. So he burst into a rage and gave up alchemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He overestimated his skill. Only a chosen few have the aptitude for alchemy. </p>

          <p>Hmph. Well, alchemy takes hard work and perspiration. Unlike that other Daeva, you might succeed, [%username]. You've more talent for alchemy than anyone I've seen since my own training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think? Do you want to try and prove your talent by making Honir's Noble Spellbook?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, you do know you can't be training to be an Expert in another field if you agree to become an Alchemy Expert, right? So think carefully before you answer.</p>

          <p>With your persistence, you will eventually produce a usable Honir's Noble Spellbook. You can buy the design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Grid].</p>

          <p>Well, few succeed on their first try. That's why people say alchemy requires persistence, perspiration, and a persnickety personality. Shards, it takes forever to turn lead to gold too!</p>
