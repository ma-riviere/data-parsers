         	<p>One moment...hmmm...I can't feel any energy from this Stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just as the scholars suspected--without an Aetheric Field, the stone has lost its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Ancient Activation Stone is the key to operate the Artifact, but I don't know how to restore its power. I've asked the scholars, but none of them had a solution.</p>
