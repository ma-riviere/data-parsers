          <p>You're beginning to make a name for yourself crafting metal armor. It's rare to find someone with such an innate feel for their materials and craft.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your work is of the highest caliber. I would be proud to put my own name to it, though I have a feeling you would object!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must be honest, though. There is something I have to ask you, a favor of sorts.</p>

          <p>I need someone to deliver these Titanium Handguards to Minon in the Abyss.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would go myself but your skills as a [%userclass] make you the ideal candidate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Minon seemed particularly eager to get hold of these gloves. Times are hard in the Abyss. Supplies are being whittled away as we speak and the merchants are really feeling the strain. What do you think? Will you help?</p>

          <p>Thank you! I can't tell you how relieved Minon will be...but you'll find out for yourself soon.</p>

already!</p>

          <p>You're the only one who can help, the only one I can rely on. Please, if you change your mind, come back and speak with me. I don't know how much longer Minon can wait.</p>
