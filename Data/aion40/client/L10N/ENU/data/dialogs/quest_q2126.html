          <p>Have you been up to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_8] yet? It's endlessly fascinating, though obviously difficult to visit with all the Mau and Dundun around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last time I went up there, I noticed a number of urns lying around. Not a big deal, right? Probably just used to store water, grain, or something equally mundane.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's not the case, though. Not the case at all....</p>

          <p>Odella juice...liquid Kinah!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That stuff is worth an absolute fortune, not that those idiot Dundun realize it. They see it as a byproduct of actual Odella production, the fools.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my mother didn't raise a fool. We could grab those urns....</p>

          <p>Exactly! Only we'll be the ones "cleaning up."</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to break into the plantation myself, but I'm on watch and thus forbidden to leave my post. It's only a matter of time until others find out what the Dundun store in those urns. Once that happens, it'll be raid plunder, subject to the same quotas as everything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that Odella juice shared for the greater good of Asmodae...unless you head up to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_8] pronto, steal the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2126a] contained in the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_8]s, and bring it back to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know a buyer in more settled lands, and I'll make sure you get a healthy cut of the profits.</p>

          <p>A profitable partnership, then. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you head up there, be careful...partner. The Mau and even some of the Dundun are extremely dangerous. They won't care that you're taking "worthless" juice--they're territorial creatures. I'd suggest you arm yourself well and take some recovery potions in case you wind up hip-deep in fuzz-faces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now get going! Three samples will be enough to spread among the interested buyers. Good luck!</p>
