          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. I must be hearing things again. It's [%username], right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't know why, but I've had trouble sleeping recently. It's strange. Whenever I do manage to drift off, I'm awake again just minutes later. I'm so tired now that I just can't concentrate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I haven't changed my routine or anything, so I can't figure out what's going on at all. I just wish I could just get some sleep, even for just an hour or so.</p>

          <p>Can you help? Actually... maybe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked my friend Melampus if he knew of any books on the subject. He said he read once that eating [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA06]s might work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The problem is, as I'm sure you're perfectly aware, Sylphen smell terrible--I can't stand going near them. And they're not likely to give up their wings without a fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't suppose you could help?</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA07] are all around this area, I'm sure you've already seen them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to Melampus, three [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA06] are sufficient to cure insomnia, though the smell would be awful. I was thinking if you took them to Uno in the village, he might be able to make them more palatable.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Sounds like an old housewife's tale to me, [%username]. I'll give it a go though--Namus is a good friend of mine.</p>

          <p>Namus is right to ask for help. These are too disgusting to eat, no matter what their healing properties. </p>
