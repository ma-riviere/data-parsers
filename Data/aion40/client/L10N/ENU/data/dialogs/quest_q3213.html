          <p>I ordered some items to be delivered by the Black Cloud Traders, but then pirates attacked the ship and stole everything!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those blasted Shugos said I couldn't get compensation because their shipping contract didn't include liability insurance.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I checked the fine print, and turns out they're right. No wonder the contract was so cheap.</p>

          <p>I suppose it wouldn't be right to take it out on the Traders. They're just doing what Shugos do best.</p>
