          <p>Losing Siel's Eastern Fortress to our enemies is humiliating.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I knew those sun-addled Red Hasia weren't up to the task. Now we have to clean up their mess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best time to attack a fortress is when it's in Vulnerable State, but our opponents aren't stupid. They'll summon elite troops for defense.</p>
