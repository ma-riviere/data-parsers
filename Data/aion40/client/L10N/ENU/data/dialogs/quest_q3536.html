          <p>Hey [%username]. How's the wild life of a traveling Daeva treating you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sounds like you've been seeing quite a bit of action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been quiet here lately, which is good, since we're woefully understaffed right now.</p>

          <p>Yes. We're hoping to get some backup troops in soon, hopefully BEFORE anyone decides to attack. Time will tell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, take a look at this. Aren't these daggers brilliant? The local Kerubiels carry them. I'm not sure what they're made of, but they're extremely light and virtually unbreakable.</p>

          <p>I'm thinking of recommending those daggers to those backup Legionaries when they arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They should be easy enough to get...the Kerubiels swarm like bees around here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I can't leave the Observatory to go on a wild dagger hunt, but you could? Hmm? Feel like gathering some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3536A]s, [%username]?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring me back a pile of those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_3536A]s, huh? They're going to make awesome daggers for the backups when they get here.</p>

          <p>Nice! They're so light, and the workmanship. Impressive. I'm just can't believe that Kerubiels crafted these. Weird.</p>

          <p>The Legionaries are going to be thrilled with these. Thanks!</p>
