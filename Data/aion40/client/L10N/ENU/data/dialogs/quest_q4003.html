          <p>Hail, Daeva. Did you come to join the Watch? It's a noble organization, and you'd be doing a great service to Asmodae.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>No? Well, it was worth asking. For me, I found my duty here. I came here hoping to cultivate this land and restore it to something of its former glory. That's tough with all these sun-cursed monsters roaming the fields and attacking the settlers, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Alone, we don't stand a chance. We organized the Watch to keep us safe long enough to get the job done.</p>

          <p>Our hard work is paying off. Contamination in the area is much lower than the past.</p>

          <p>Still, we can't farm with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CentipedeD_21_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_CuresSpotD_21_An]s attacking us in the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their very presence adds to the contamination, undoing our hard work. It has to stop.</p>

          <p>I'm not saying the Watch can't fight--we have, but we're not trained troops here. We earn more casualties than victories, though that's better than fatalities, you know?</p>
