          <p>[%username], thank goodness you're here! Something very unusual is going on and I'm worried I might be setting myself up for a terrible fall.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yesterday there was a sudden darkness in the middle of the afternoon, and several villagers claim to have heard strange whispering voices.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then at midnight I woke to a strange tapping on my door. There was an old man there who asked me to weave a certain garment for him--one of my "special" robes.</p>

          <p>It grants special abilities! The wearer can detect [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA13], and more specifically, those who can wield Aetheric energy, such as [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA09]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I tried to work out who he was, but it was dark and his face was hidden by a heavy cloak. I was suspicious, but the money offered was substantial, and I had no real reason to say no.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was only this morning, when I took out my designs and started working out what items that I needed, that I realized who the old man was. It was [%dic:STR_DIC_LA12].</p>

          <p>Have you not heard of him? The Hermit who lives up on Agaric Spore Road? There are rumors around the village about his... experiments out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, I agreed to make the robe, but I'm lacking the main material--[%dic:STR_DIC_MLA06] skins. I was actually hoping a [%userclass] like you would be able to help. Abex are far too tough for me to kill.</p>

          <p>I'll get started on the inner fabric right away. If you could get three [%dic:STR_DIC_QILA07]s, I should have just about enough material for the robe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_MLA06] can be found in the [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA04]. They're quite passive creatures, but if attacked they are dangerous animals. Please be careful!</p>
