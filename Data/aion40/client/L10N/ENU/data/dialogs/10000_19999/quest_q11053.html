          <p>Since word of my finding has spread, I will tell you the truth, Daeva. It is indeed a fact that I have found some of the legendary Inggison armor...the shoes, to be precise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Touched by Empyrean Lady Yustiel herself, this armor is unlike anything you've ever seen before. I found it deep below a cliff as I was helping Sulinia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But by that bewildered look on your face, it is apparent to me now that you know nothing of this....</p>

          <p>I have no idea who the shoes belonged to originally. I would try to sell them, but I wouldn't make anything without the rest of the set.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The pauldrons, jacket, pants, and gloves are all scattered around out there. A fortune waiting to be found...but not by me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead, I've decided to give these Inggison shoes to a Daeva who can prove himself worthy.</p>

          <p>They do me no good. And besides, those Beybey Crettins and Lagaga Crettins are acting up again. I'll give the shoes as a reward to whoever helps me out with them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it, [%username]? Could you handle those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Ettin_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_EttinBig_55_An]s for us?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The shoes are yours if you do...but I would prefer it if you also give me 50,000 Kinah so I can fix the shoes up real nice for you. Do we have ourselves a deal?</p>

          <p>Oh, wonderful, [%username]! I guess you know the value of Inggison shoes. So, eliminate the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Ettin_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_EttinBig_55_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And make sure to bring their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11053a] when you come back here. It's not that I don't trust you, but I need proof. And don't forget about the 50,000 Kinah that we discussed.</p>

          <p>Arieluma. How did things go? Did you kill off the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Ettin_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_EttinBig_55_An]s?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm still hearing stories about Guardians and Daevas being attacked out there--this is exactly why I requested to see some proof.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you did get them all, then you must have the Dry Ettin Leaves, right? And how about the 50,000 Kinah?</p>
