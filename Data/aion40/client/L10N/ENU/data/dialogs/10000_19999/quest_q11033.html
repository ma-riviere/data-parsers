          <p>You know, [%username], I'm getting really close to giving up. I am terrible at cooking!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This land is just horrible for an aspiring chef.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I have another idea first. I will not admit defeat just yet! I am an Elyos, and we do not ever admit defeat...even when cooking!</p>

          <p>Have you ever tried Vortile Fins? They're almost entirely fat and cartilage, and they have a strange greasy texture...but they're delicious!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was invited to a dinner party in Sanctum once, and the host served the fins on a bed of greens. Very unique! Everybody asked how he made them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, that's my next idea. I want to experiment with [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11033a]s. So would you bring me the fins of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Varanus_Axolotl_51_n]s?</p>
