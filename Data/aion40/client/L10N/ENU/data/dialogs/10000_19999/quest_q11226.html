          <p>Well, I was working an operation and royally screwed it up. Centurion Pucio, who's not the kindest Daeva in Aion, actually covered for me...took the heat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wanted to thank him by doing something special for the little guy. So I asked around and found out what he likes...which was no easy task.</p>

          <p>Greesees hides in Greatshade Valley, where it's nice and dark. You have to use the geyser to get there, but that's guarded by Huge Waterfall Starturtles.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A bit tricky, but you can handle it. Just one good Greesees's Tentacle will do.</p>
