	<p>Not all creatures of Atreia respect her ancient treasures as much as we Elyos, [%username].</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Take the Asmodians, for instance. Do you honestly think that they stop to protect treasures as they scavenge through the dirt and dust, looking for whatever it is they call food? </p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>No, they would trample and crush the most beautiful vase to strip a Sparkie leg of its rotting remnants.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>It's no wonder Aion graced this land with us Elyos, friend. Who else has the presence of mind to preserve its past and collect her treasures for its people to study?</p>

	<p>Ah, yes, yes. Lesser Ancient Goblets.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Though these are the least valuable of the goblets, there is still some information that can be gleaned from its weathered shape. I shall send these off to Sanctum as soon as I am able.</p>

	<p>Oh, good! I was rather afraid you were going to bring me lesser grade goblets.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>See these details? Though scratched and damaged, they can still be made out. And here! I believe this is ancient symbol for Tiamat himself! How interesting! Yes, these are certainly worth studying.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Here's your reward, friend. Take it with Sanctum's thanks. Faith and arms.</p>

	<p>Oh my! These are wonderful!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>See the distinct orange tinge to the metal? This material was only used in the years that immediately followed the Cataclysm, leading many to argue that the metal came from the Tower of Eternity itself!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you, [%username]. You've done very well indeed. Your reward is more than deserved.</p>

	<p>Outstanding! Such quality is almost never seen! And the markings!</p>

	<p>[%username], see this scene here? I believe it's depicting the vote our Empyrean Lords underwent before approaching the Dragon Lords and proposing peace. This is from before the Cataclysm!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I'll have these sent to Sanctum right away. You've done very, very well, my friend.</p>

	<p>The goblets collected here will be sent to the Sanctum Treasury. There they will be studied and evaluated for information. Anything that doesn't pose a security risk, and is new, is then published.</p>

	<p>It's a slow but important process, friend.</p>
