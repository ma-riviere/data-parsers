          <p>You're in luck. High Priest Eremitia from the Cloister of Kaisinel just ordered a spellbook, and I think you should make it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The design is ready, so go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Darius] and ask him for it.</p>

          <p>The other is Eremitia's Noble Spellbook with its detailed crafting instructions. You'll get Eremitia's Noble Spellbook every time with that one--as long as you succeed in crafting it, of course. It is a bit more expensive, however.</p>
