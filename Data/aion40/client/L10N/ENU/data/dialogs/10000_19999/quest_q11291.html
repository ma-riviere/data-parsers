          <p>Now it's time to reap the fruits of all our efforts. I have received word from the Guardian who I sent to investigate the Dramata.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aion has truly smiled on us. She has found Padmarashka's cave! We must pray that it is not too late.</p>

          <p>According to Jamia's report, there may be some spawn. If that's the case, we must act quickly!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've marked the location of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_C3] on your map, so please hurry there and ask Jamia for more details.</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Jamia] is the Dramata Researcher who found the lair. It's in the Forest of Antiquity, so it's little wonder that we had difficulty locating it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her report indicated that she had further information relevant to defeating Padmarashka, but it's best if you hear it directly from her. She's posted herself outside the lair so that she can monitor who--and what--goes in and out.</p>

          <p>Padmarashka's reputation is indeed terrifying. Perhaps you do not have the associates to help you with this daunting task.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, it never ascended as a Dragon Lord, no matter how hard it tried, so we know that it is fallible. Perhaps the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_Arena_L_Lobby] can help you hone your skills, and you will one day be ready.</p>

          <p>Finally! I've been waiting days for Outremus to send someone! I know there can't be too many Daevas who are up to this challenge, but I've been out here on my own... and the Drakan that have gone in and out... I tell you, we need to act!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When I first found the Dramata Lair, I thought I was the lucky one. Of all those researchers sent out to hunt Padmarashka, I was the one who found it! This was going to make my career!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now I'm wondering if I'll even make it out of this alive. I don't really want to be awarded prizes posthumously.</p>

          <p>Oh, man! You think I've been in there to look at it? Oh no, no, no. I just follow tracks, analyze Balaur documents, and monitor the comings and goings. I can guarantee you it's in there, but what it looks like, what its powers are, how many eggs it's laid... all this is a mystery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I did manage to grab the key off one of those Drakan, though. I should probably mention that you can only use it one time, so good luck!.</p>
