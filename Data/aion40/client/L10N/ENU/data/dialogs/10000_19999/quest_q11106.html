          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. You know, the longer I research ancient Balaurea, the more empathy I feel for the Reian tribe.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were all brothers and sisters at one time, the Elyos and Reians. Now we view them in the same light as Asmodians.</p>

          <p>I would like to cull together interviews with Reian tribesmen and publish a corpus about their history in the Library of the Sages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What do you think? We can start with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Savinus] and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gelon]. They are both very old Reians--they'll remember the way it used to be.</p>

          <p>Take this Book of Record. When someone speaks aloud with his hand on the cover, the book records every word he says. It's a fascinating creation, isn't it?</p>

          <p>Well, it was many, many years ago, before the great fall of the night curtain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We were Atreians just like you, and we worshipped Siel as you do. Siel loved us very much and bestowed upon us the name "The People of Siel's Spear."</p>

          <p>Yes, many generations ago. Those Reians that survived the Cataclysm were stuck in Balaurea. Our fathers settled in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have endured this land for a long, long time. And I believe this is how the misunderstanding came about. We are not one with the Balaur--we simply share the same land.</p>
