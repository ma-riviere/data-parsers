          <p>I've been watching you [%username], and I believe you can handle one more Greater Stigma. However, as you know, the Greater Stigmas are very powerful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to prove that you're qualified to handle such power by joining in with [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_Occupation_Combat] in Tiamaranta, by going to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDArena_pvp_L], or by hunting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Speak to me again, choose whichever seems the best challenge, then best it. I'll then be able to give you a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q11550_stigma].</p>

          <p>Now, return the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Q11550_stigma] I gave you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid I've forgotten, [%username]: have you been to partake in [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_Occupation_Combat], or did you enter the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDArena_pvp_L]? Perhaps you went Macori hunting?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Either way, I'll grant you a further Greater Stigma Slot with the power embedded in your Stigma.</p>

          <p>He added that stronger power requires a qualified handler, and asked you to prove yourself in siege warfare, the Crucible Coliseum, or hunting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you proved yourself without difficulty, he granted you an extra Stigma Slot.</p>
