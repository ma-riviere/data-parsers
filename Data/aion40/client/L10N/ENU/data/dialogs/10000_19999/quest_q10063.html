          <p>[%username], I figured it out! I couldn't understand why my magic was so useless at the Heart of Gravity, but I know what's going on!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When the Heart comes under attack, the Incarnation appears to protect it. I just assumed that the Incarnation was just the leader of the Heart's guard unit. But I was wrong....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Incarnation is the source of power itself! The Incarnation IS the Heart!</p>

          <p>I know! There's an Incarnation for every Heart: Fissure Incarnate in the Heart of Fissure, Wrath Incarnate in the Heart of Wrath... and so on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're deploying troops into the Hearts as soon as possible, and I want you to take Petrification Incarnate. Once the Heart of Petrification is under siege, Petrification Incarnate will appear. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Betri] is stationed nearby, so speak to him for advice. It will be a vicious battle, [%username], so bring as many allies as possible.</p>

          <p>And so the other Hearts will drain of power as the Incarnations fall. And then Tiamaranta's Eye will open, and we will bring the Dragon Lord to its knees!</p>

          <p>You crushed Petrification Incarnate in the Heart of Petrification, and brought Garnon its claw.</p>
