          <p>Hmmm, this is bad. With Tiamat's power weakening Kahrun's Will in Enos Forest, we've been having more and more battles there of late.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's bad enough there with the Balaur and Asmodians, but the local "wildlife" is wreaking havoc on our efforts there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to do some preemptive damage control by taking out some of the monsters before we have further problems.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Start with the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Enos_59_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Enos_Baby_59_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C2_Fethlot_59_An]es. Clear them out so we don't have any more problems.</p>

          <p>I spent an hour today just standing outside and drinking in the atmosphere of Tiamaranta. Bracing!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's rare that I get a moment to myself like that. It'll become even rarer if we keep having problems in Enos Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I trust that you have taken steps to alleviate the situation there.</p>

          <p>Of course not. I doubt you'd have ever been let into Tiamaranta if you were otherwise.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we've got one less thing to worry about. All we have left are the Balaur and the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hah--"all." I laugh so I don't cry. But thank you for your efforts on our behalf. I hope we can count on you again in the future.</p>

          <p>Erephe told you that with Tiamat's power weaking Kahrun's Will in Enos Forest, the three fronted battle with Balaur, Asmodians, and the local beasts were too much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You went in and killed monsters there so Elysea's Daevas would have one less front to worry about.</p>
