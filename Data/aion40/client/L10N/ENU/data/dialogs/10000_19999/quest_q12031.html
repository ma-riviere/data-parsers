          <p>[%userclass], our victory here--over Tiamat and the furbacks, both--depends on the utmost discretion. Understand? Good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tests on an area inside the Eye we're calling the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_TDown_ItemUseArea_Q12031A] indicate a rift opening into a massive power. Perhaps even the kind of power appropriate to a Dragon Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the rift there is unstable. It's likely that what we've discovered is just a projection of the actual entrance to Tiamat Stronghold. A reflection, of sorts. But if we send a Sounding Gem through there, it will lead us to the true entrance. And that will open the way to the Dragon Lord itself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Activate the Sounding Gem there, [%userclass]. Do it quickly and without betraying your objective. The Balaur, the Asmodians, even the Reians--no-one can know.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes... That would explain the heavy guard in the north quarter of the Eye. I suspected the entrance to Tiamat Stronghold might be there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My sword aches to lead the charge. But my orders were to locate the entrance, not move on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Good work, but I must ask you to keep your silence, [%userclass]. We will not have to wait long.</p>

          <p>Ruonas sent you on a secret mission to find the entrance to Tiamat Stronghold. When you used the Sounding Gem, the way to the place appeared. You then followed the road, and found the Tiamat Stronghold Entrance in the north of Tiamaranta's Eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned and reported the result to Ruonas. He was pleased that the first step to defeat Dragon Lord had been taken.</p>
