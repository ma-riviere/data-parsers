          <p>The Elim Fruit has been a remedy for almost everything since ancient times. It's filled with the essence of Aether...of positive energy.</p>

          <p>But it's not easy to find, [%username]. I think you were swindled...I think she asked you because she knew you'd know how to get it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's hardly any of the fruit around these days. Most Elim in Inggison died some time ago, and [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Tree_NoMove_Tramis] is the only one left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid getting that fruit from Tramis is the only way to make this cure. Can you get it?</p>
