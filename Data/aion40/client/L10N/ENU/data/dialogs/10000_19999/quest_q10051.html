          <p>Ah, [%username]. I have a message for you. It is... quite strange.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A member of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_12] just strolled into headquarters yesterday, bold as anything, claiming he carried a message for the Elyos. He would say only this: "[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Lephar] wishes to speak to [%username] in person." Yes, he used your name and everything.</p>
          <p> </p>        
          <p>I assume that he is mistaken. An honorable warrior like you would never have anything to do with the Lepharists... would you? Anyway, he left his name, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Philmoi], and said he would be waiting for you in Garldar Village. Do with that information what you will. Perhaps you should ask someone trusted for advice first...?</p>

          <p>Well, I can't imagine why he would ask to speak to you, of all people. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had no idea he was even in Sarpan. I wonder... does he move against Tiamat as well? If he is, then our enemy's enemy could be our friend. It is worth hearing what he has to say.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or... it could also be a trap. Look into it, [%username], but do not let your guard down for a moment.</p>

          <p>No, he is not here, but he left this [%dic:STR_DIC_ILDF4a_FOBJ_Q10051] so that you might reach him. Unfortunately, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A2_IronGolem_57_An]s stole the Orb's energy source, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_10051A]s, while I slept last night.</p>

          <p>No, there is no time for questions, Daeva. Time runs very short. You must carry a message to your fellows. It is of utmost importance, and must be taken immediately.</p>

          <p>What? Lephar is Empyrean Lord Israphel? No, no... you must have been deceived!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I cannot believe... If Lephar is lying, then he is an ambitious liar, that is for certain. But... if it's true, it does explain many of his actions. And it explains Tiamat's unprecedented power. Hmm... I do believe he spoke the truth about Siel's Relics. That makes sense. Yes, we must act on that immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But... truly, you spoke with Lord Israphel? Amazing...  this will throw Sanctum into complete turmoil...</p>

          <p>Kutos delivered a strange message given him by a Lepharist Revolutionary, Philmoni. It was from Lephar, who wants to speak to you personally.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Philmoni sent you to meet Lephar using the Orb of Passage, but once there, you discovered something truly remarkable: Lephar is the Empyrean Lord Israphel, long thought dead.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Israphel convinced you that Atreia would fall to Tiamat if the Dragon Lord was allowed to keep control of Siel's Relics. You immediately left for Killios. Shocked as he was, he agreed that Siel's Relics should not remain in Tiamat's possession.</p>
