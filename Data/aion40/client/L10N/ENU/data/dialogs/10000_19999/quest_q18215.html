          <p>I know you're probably eager to get into the Crucible Coliseum, but we have to restrict who can go in there, and how often.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't want someone wandering in there unprepared, and we don't want more Daevas than we can deal with, just in case something goes wrong. That's why each hopeful is limited to one ticket per day, and even then only if we have enough left.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you don't already have a ticket, [%username], I can assign you one.</p>
