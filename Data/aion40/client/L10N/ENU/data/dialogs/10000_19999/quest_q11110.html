          <p>As you've most likely noticed, Aran doesn't want to leave the Jotun Studio.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder what it was like to have seen the light of Aion's glory in the flesh...to lead his people to safety in this cursed land of Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can only imagine what he felt.</p>

          <p>I know I was supposed to speak with Aran, but I haven't yet. There are several Jotun guarding the Studio on his behalf.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I prefer talking with people. I was never a friend of senseless fighting. To be honest, I figured Cicero would send someone to check up on me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And he did: you. So, would you clear out those Jotun so I can speak with Aran?</p>

          <p>The idea was to buy me some time...so I could ponder my approach to the negotiation.</p>

          <p>And I hate to say it, but I still need more time before I can approach Aran. Maybe go back out and kill a few more? Buy me a few more minutes to prepare....</p>
