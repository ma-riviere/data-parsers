          <p>Well, you'll need three things: Kromede's Tear, the Jewel of the Judge, and a very talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first thing and, now that you found me, you have the third thing. You just need the Jewel of the Judge. If you can get that, I'll take care of the rest.</p>
