          <p>Those poor Shulacks. I tried to persuade them nicely to please let us put our Obelisk in their village--great idea they had, building that village--but they didn't go for it. So we'll have to install the Obelisks by force.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They asked for it. They should have been more flexible and realized we couldn't be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I feel sorry for them. But I have no choice. We have to install an Obelisk if we want to defeat Tiamat. You up for making your mark on Inggison?</p>
