          <p>Did the Daeva see all the ginseng in Haramel? Mountains of it. Those poor slaves are starving...but Hamerun eats three meals a day of that tasty ginseng! Nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moorilerk loves ginseng. Always reminds Moorilerk of his friend Manos at the Verteron Citadel.</p>

          <p>No, no, no, Daeva! Moorilerk is just reflecting on the past...reflecting out loud, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Manos is very old. Has had a hard life. Would like to bring him some ginseng soup...but still under suspicion, nyerk. Moorilerk cannot leave area.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe the kind, kind Daeva would bring my old friend some ginseng soup?</p>

          <p>Very kind Daeva, nyerk. Very kind. Moorilerk saw dried ginseng in the Odella Processing Plant in Haramel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Get five tasty-looking pieces of ginseng, put them in the huge cauldron, and boil them down to soup. When all cooked and good, take it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo2].</p>
