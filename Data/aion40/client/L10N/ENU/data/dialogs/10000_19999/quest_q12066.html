          <p>Tiamat is growing ever more desperate. But as we know, it is the desperate who are often the most dangerous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has been expending great amounts of power to create new obstacles in our path. We must expend even more to overcome them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum's alchemists have created a Experimental Potion which should allow Daevas to draw on the power of the Hearts for their own use.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we must test it first. Get into one of [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4B_ItemUseArea_Q12066A] however you can, and drink the potion. Report the results back to me.</p>

          <p>Every day, I get reports of skirmishes--or worse--over the four Heart fortresses. Events are becoming chaotic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One such report mentioned you. I assume this means you completed your mission? What happened?</p>

          <p>Excellent! I'll report this to Sanctum's alchemists at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't have a way to mass-produce the potions yet, but once we do....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, that will be a glorious day! Thank you for bringing it one step closer.</p>

          <p>Ancanus told you that Sanctum was working on a special potion that drew on the power of the Heart fortresses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To test the potion, you battled your way into one of the Hearts and drank it. It seemed to work perfectly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You reported this back to Ancanus, who was pleased at this potentially lethal new weapon against Elysea's enemies.</p>
