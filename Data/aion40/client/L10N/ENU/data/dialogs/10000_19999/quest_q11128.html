          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Have I told you how fast some Klaws can defeat a Daeva? I've seen it happen in three breaths!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Breath, breath, breath--dead! Three breaths.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Moreover, these Supraklaws out here in Inggison...they're even stronger because of that Drana everywhere. They're a worthy adversary, Daeva.</p>

          <p>I have? Well, it's true. Auralia can attest to that. She ran into a few Klaws and ended up losing the Jewel of Wisdom while fending them off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine that? Losing her Jewel of Wisdom? She was so ashamed that she only told me about it...said she didn't want it anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, [%username], there's a tasty reward if you can bring it back. You'll have to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Neut_NamedQ_54_An] to get it, though.</p>

          <p>Auralia is a good fighte, a strong soldier. Reminds me of myself in my younger days. This means that [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Neut_NamedQ_54_An] will be difficult to deal with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He lives deep inside Klawnickt's Cave. So that's where the Jewel of Wisdom will be.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you get it bring it back to me...I want to see what all this fuss is about.</p>

          <p>You're just going to let the Jewel of Wisdom rot there? Or are you just too afraid to take on King Myrn? He's a worthy adversary, all right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I could have taken him in my younger days...no problem. Now's a different story. Too much research, not enough practice. Well, it's there waiting for you when you're ready.</p>

          <p>That Jewel of Wisdom isn't going to wait there forever, [%username]! I think Auralia is headed back out there to reclaim it herself. There's no reward for second place.</p>
