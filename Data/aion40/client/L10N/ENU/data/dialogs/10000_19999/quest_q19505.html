          <p>[%username]. I feel like I know you already...Jumentis and Eumelos tell great stories of your exploits and skills! They were just telling me about the time....</p>

          <p>Oh, sorry. I digress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Things are heating up, and we'll all need to be on our toes. Our reputations won't mean a thing to the Balaur Lords. Skill! That's what'll count.</p>

          <p>We've been whaling on the Asmodians in the Abyss, and many of us have forgotten that our true enemy is the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Under the protection of Aion's Aetheric Field, it's been pretty easy to keep the Balaur at bay...but those days may be ending. I've been instructed to teach my students how to fight without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yeah. Really. I'm supposed to train my Temple students to survive without the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like to join us at the Temple of Freedom and learn to increase your power?</p>

          <p>The Temple just crafted a powerful Greater Stigma based on a technique we discovered while battling the Steel Rake. We've tested its powers in Dark Poeta with incredible results and want to get this Greater Stigma out into the battlefield, but we can only give it to Daevas who've proven that they're capable of handling such raw power.</p>

          <p>A Ranger like you, you can use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use it ten times, to prove your mastery. Then come see me again.</p>
