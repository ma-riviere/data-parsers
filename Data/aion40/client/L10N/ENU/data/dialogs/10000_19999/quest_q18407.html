          <p>You see, I have some background in Balaur studies. It's served me well in my duties as a centurion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These designs tell me that this blade was fashioned and presented personally by a Dragon Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In this case, this crest tells me it's Tiamat. How did you get your hands on such a thing?</p>

          <p>Did you indeed? Odd. These weapons are not just a symbol of power. They actually grace a Dragon Lord's power to the wielder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're only given to the highest Drakan officials. That such a powerful weapon would be broken....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Further, the idea of an ordinary Balaur having a piece should be unthinkable. This needs to be investigated, at once!</p>

          <p>We should start with the head of the Esoterrace. He's the most likely to have been given this weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I doubt Warden Surama himself will be forthcoming. But he's a scientist, and all good scientists keep notes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look for his journals. The Balaur use large spheres to keep information in. It should be somewhere within the Esoterrace.</p>

          <p>Perhaps I didn't properly express just how strange these circumstances are.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Imagine getting a weapon directly from Lady Ariel. Imagine that it gave you a portion of her mighty powers.</p>

          <p>Now imagine shattering it and throwing it away. We must find an explanation for this, lest it foretell something malign.</p>

          <p>Interesting. From what I can tell, Surama thought that the blade was made in order to spy on him. I wouldn't put it past Tiamat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that he felt this drastic step necessary may be a sign of trouble amongst the Dragon Lords. I pray to Aion that's the case.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what happened to this Tiamat's Power after Surama shattered it? Take this to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Antigone]--she has expertise in this kind of thing.</p>

          <p>Ahh, interesting. I love getting into the minds of Drakan. What you can understand, you can manipulate...and defeat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But if Tillen wants to know what happened to the blade of this sword, that portion of the journal is quite distorted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I can work with it, though. Stay close, and I'll have something for you soon.</p>
