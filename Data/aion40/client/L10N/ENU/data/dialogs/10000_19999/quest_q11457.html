          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. How does life treat you today?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the by, did you know that, as with normal trees, you can examine the inner wood of Elim to find out how old an Elim is, and even what environment it first grew in?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have this sudden urge to study [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Mark_Q11457]s from Taloc for that reason. What do you think? Is it worthy of my time?</p>

          <p>Yes, I know, I know. But I'll never get a thesis published in Inggison if I just collect Aether and wait around for war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That is not my destiny, Daeva. Discovery is my destiny! Fame is my destiny! Acclamation is my destiny!</p>

          <p>I'll leave the war efforts to the soldiers. My fate is something much brighter than simple bloodshed!</p>

          <p>Yes, yes, I agree. But this isn't merely for pride's sake. If my theory works, it can help all Daevas live richer, fuller lives.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll tell you what, [%username]. If you help me find what I need for my thesis, I will continue to perform my lowly chores as ordered.</p>

          <p>Splendid, splendid! [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Mark_Q11457] is an elusive study...a study in luck, more than anything.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Few Daevas can tell one type of wood from another, let alone what purpose it serves. You'll have to keep your eyes sharp and your blade even sharper, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And please, tell no one of my thesis. Any Daeva would give his wings for an idea like this.</p>

          <p>Interesting...Taloc's Wooden Core is quite different from other Elim that I have studied. See this line here?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It illustrates the wood's rapid growth due to a high concentration of Aether...just as I had surmised. This part here shows when fragments of the Tower of Eternity collided with the Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My thesis begins...now! Thank you, Daeva. I will be sure and thank you in my award speech...whenever that might be. Fame is reward enough, right?</p>
