          <p>The Heart of Wrath is quite the inhospitable place. Still, even a land such as Tiamaranta has its wonders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take the Luster Fragment, for example. It's charged with a type of Aether that is unknown in both Elysea and Asmodae. Apparently they are formed in the ground, and Shimmering Twisters "dig" them up.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've gotten word from Sanctum that the scholars there are eager to study some. As long as you're here, why don't you oblige them?</p>

          <p>Personally, I'm unsure about this mission. It invests much time and hope into something that may not work out.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But then, I'm not the one making these decisions. What should I tell Sanctum, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Hmmm, they are pretty, at the least. If nothing else, I suppose the Handicrafters will have something else to work with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, though, the Aether in these fragments will tell us something about this world... or give us access to new power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's not our concern or yours. You've done your job, and done it well, I add.</p>

          <p>Mikena reported that Sanctum wanted you to gather Luster Fragments obtained from Tornado Spirits for study.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you killed Sparkle Twisters and took the fragments to you found back to Mikena. You were thanked for your service.</p>
