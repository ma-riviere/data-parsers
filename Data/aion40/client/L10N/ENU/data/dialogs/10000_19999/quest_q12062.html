          <p>Here's a fact: the Gurriki are actually a peaceful race. If you've ever been to the heart of their home, you'd know this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, Tiamat's power has either corrupted their minds, or lured them with promises of future reward. Thus many are now our enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need someone to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuFi_57_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuWi_57_An]s to help prevent any more from turning to the Balaur. I'd like you to be that someone.</p>

          <p>The Gurriki homeland was once under the protection of Kahrun's Will, but not anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder if this flare of Tiamat's power corrupting the Gurrikis has something to do with that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, if you did your job, the threat posed on at least one front should be reduced.</p>

          <p>Ah, my apologies. I did not mean to imply that you were not a tireless worker for Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your aid. Hopefully, the remaining Gurrikis will not be as susceptible to Tiamat's influence, willing or not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Use this reward from Sanctum to further strengthen yourself, and bring more glory to Elysea. Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>Karuti said that Tiamat's power had turned Gurriki Swamp into a battlefield the Elyos couldn't afford to ignore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you killed some of the Gurriki Warriors and Gurriki Shamans that had been corrupted by the Balaur. Karuti hoped this would improve the chances that the pure Gurriki would remain so.</p>
