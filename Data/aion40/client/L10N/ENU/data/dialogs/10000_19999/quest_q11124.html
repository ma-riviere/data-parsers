          <p>Those black-hearted Neokins and Barghests! Every time I turn around, those little savages are attacking us! We'll never survive this land with them around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We finally drive the Balaur away and build a fortress. Then the damned Asmodians attack us...then those beasts take their turn! When will we get a breath?</p>

          <p>I can attest to that, [%username]! Too much darkness and not enough light, it seems like. Especially my life!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Asmodians I can handle. Balaur too. I can handle a lot of things, Daeva, but those soulless and savage Neokins and Barghests! They turn crazy in battle, and you can't fight crazy without going mad yourself!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Husblade Legion would be forever in your debt if you could kill as many of those...savages as you can.</p>
