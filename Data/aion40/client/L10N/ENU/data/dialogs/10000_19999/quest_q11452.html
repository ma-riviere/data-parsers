          <p>Yes...yes, these symptoms match that of a previous malady I worked on. I made an ointment back then that seemed to work wonders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I remember correctly, I marinated the Fruits of Elim in [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_11452a], pureed them, and applied the paste to the skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was a very difficult concoction to make...took nearly a month to get it right.</p>

          <p>If I'm not mistaken...I'll need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_11452a]. It sounds threatening, but we need to kill the fever to end the sickness.</p>
