          <p>Just because we now control the Heart of Petrification doesn't mean there aren't other matters to take care of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to rearm our troops. The Reians have blacksmiths who can make weapons for us, but they face a problem. To make their special weapons, their forges must be particularly hot. The only fuel that is sufficient is Dragrint's White Charcoal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They are already killing Flame Dragrints for it, but they need help. If you join their efforts, you will be aiding them and us at once.</p>

          <p>Our current arms supply is holding steady for now. But I am certain that will change soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians need Dragrint's White Charcoal, and we need the Reians.</p>

          <p>Hot indeed! A charcoal that burns on its own! No wonder the Reians use it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This should be sufficient. Between this and what they already have, they should start forging weapons immediately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your advancement of our war effort will not go unnoticed, by me or by Sanctum.</p>

          <p>The Reian Tribe asked Coron for aid in procuring fuel so they could make the Elyos new weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you killed Flame Dragrints and turned in Dragrint's White Charcoal. Coron was pleased at your efforts for the war effort.</p>
