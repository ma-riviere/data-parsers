          <p>No! We are feathertips apart, and still trouble boils up and rips us away once more!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But misfortune does not make us doubt on our intentions. Instead, it strengthens our resolve and places fire in our hearts! [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Aurio], dear Aurio! I will marry you! I will think up the method during the night, and during the day, while I sleep, I will dream of us together!</p>
          <p>  </p>
          <p>Oh hoo! That's it! Sleep! Hoo hoo! Daeva, you must find me a sleeping potion! There is no time to explain why, but run, fly, as fast as you can!</p>

          <p>That Owllaet's quite a piece of work, isn't she? It probably comes as no surprise, but Aurio is every bit as crazed as she is. They actually belong together, though ending the Urugugu Tribe warms my heart than the sappiest of Strigik love stories, I'm afraid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, regarding that sleeping potion. I've been... oh. Haha. I should explain. I had my men check up on you a little while ago. I wanted to make sure you were still working, you see. Nothing personal.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, I've got an idea for this potion. I want you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3] and kill the Delirium Dionaes around there. Harvest their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11511_bottle], and you should have the ultimate sleep medicine. Just be vague if Owllaet asks about the ingredients.</p>

          <p>Did you bring the concoction that I asked for? I ask without knowing, for I cannot see it on your person.</p>

          <p>A Daeva in the form of an angel in more ways than one! With this potion, you unlock the world's greatest gift, my dear friend: love! Hoo hoo!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally! [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Aurio] and I will be together forever! I will take this potion and fall into a deep, deep slumber, so unshakeable that the others, foolish as they are, will assume me dead, broken from the loss of Periwoo no doubt! Hoo hoo! But, once I am carried from the village, I will awaken, and join with my dear Aurio!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A perfect plan, and a perfect romance! Everything is ready, Daeva.</p>

          <p>Owllaet told you how her tribe had tightened their guard after Count Periwoo was killed. This had made it harder for her to see her one true love, Aurio, forcing her to extreme solutions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Eventually, she came up with a plan. She would take a strong sleeping agent, so powerful that her tribesmen would think her dead. After being carried from the village, she would awaken, and escape with Aurio for a wonderful life together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sadly for them, Molius had different plans. He suggested you replace her sleeping potion with poison, and after harvesting deadly poison sacs from the nearby Dionae creatures, you handed the young Strigik the bottle...</p>
