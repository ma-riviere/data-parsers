          <p>Hmm, that was quick work on Sanctum's part. I've already gotten word back about your discovery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, support from Kaisinel's Agent sped up the process greatly.</p>

          <p>About what you'd expect. We need to take down the Esoterrace--the sooner, the better.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the key to any factory or farm is the people working there. Destroy them, and we destroy the ability to function.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This could open up future attacks on Tiamaranta. And since you made the discovery, Sanctum wants you to lead the charge.</p>

          <p>We've determined that the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q18401]s should be your top priority.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They seem to do most of the work in producing Drana and its offshoots. Soldiers are easy for them to replace...researchers are not.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't forget the allies you took before. I'm sure they'll be of equal use now.</p>

          <p>I'm surprised at you...and not in a good way. Sanctum specifically chose you for this mission.</p>

          <p>Are you refusing a call from the Seraphim Lords? Rebelling like some lawless Asmodian?</p>

          <p>I've been consulting with Sanctum while you were away. They're coordinating attacks on the Esoterrace as we speak.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We hope to wear it down before Tiamat can send reinforcements. Yours is but the first of several major assaults.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>From the weariness in your eyes and the stains on your armor, I assume it went well?</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>But there is still much left to do. Researchers remain at the Esoterrace. And other things must be done.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But for now, enjoy these rewards, given to me by Veille personally. They reflect our gratitude for your work.</p>

          <p>You went to the cursed Drana farm and slew many of its personnel. You returned to much gratitude and a hearty reward.</p>
