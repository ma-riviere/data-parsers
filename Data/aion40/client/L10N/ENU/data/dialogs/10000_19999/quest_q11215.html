          <p>Ah, [%username], I didn't recognize your knees! This is no time for humor, I suppose. We have lost the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A]...a lot of good Daevas fell in its defense.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once the upper hand is lost, the battle picks its winning side, and in this case...we fell short. Hah, a little more gallows humor there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We followed Kaisinel all the way here.... We can't retreat now. We have to reclaim the upper hand!</p>

          <p>I like your attitude. I wish more Daevas shared it. We need to rebuild our momentum--that's what we need, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're ready to become the hero we need, then organize a force of soldiers you trust and attack the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_11215]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can help return the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A] to Elyos hands, Empyrean Lord Kaisinel will surely be grateful to you.</p>

          <p>Killing the guards at the fortress will be difficult, but the real problem will be the Guardian General.</p>

          <p>But we have other legions out there ready to strike when you do, so that should calm some nerves.</p>

          <p>If you can defeat the Guardian General and reclaim the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2011_A], [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Queesia] and her Wisplight Legion will be dispatched. May the protection of Kaisinel be with you.</p>
