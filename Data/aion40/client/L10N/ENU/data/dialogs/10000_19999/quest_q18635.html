          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I see you have Kromede's Flame. Been a long time since I've seen that. I can introduce you to a Shugo trader around here who might swap you some Kinah for it. Or....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can melt it down and compound it with the Staff of the Judge to make one very strong, very potent weapon.</p>

          <p>The Staff of the Judge. You'll need to get it first. You'll need three things, actually.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which luckily you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the third and final item you'll need is the Staff of the Judge. But you'll need to pry it from its current owner's hands.</p>

          <p>No need to thank me, [%username]. I have the easy part in this transaction. You, on the other hand, have the hard part: getting the staff.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to take it from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. And she won't be too thrilled to see it go.</p>
