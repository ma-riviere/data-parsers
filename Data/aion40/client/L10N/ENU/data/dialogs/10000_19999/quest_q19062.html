          <p>Being a preceptor means I get to train up some of the most promising Daevas that Elysea has to offer. But sometimes, the teacher finds themselves actually outclassed by their student. With you, [%username], I am that teacher.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have written a letter of recommendation for you to take to the Cloister of Kaisinel. There you will find [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Pilitas], the greatest mentor a fine [%userclass] like yourself could hope to study under.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now, friend. You still have much to learn, even if I cannot teach it.</p>

          <p>I'll work you harder than you've ever worked, [%username]. I'll make you regret ever coming to me with this letter, but once we're done, you'll be grateful that I steered you right.</p>
