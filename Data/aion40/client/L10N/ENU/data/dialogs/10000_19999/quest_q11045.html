          <p>I'm afraid I can't stop and chat with you today, [%username]. The Elyos army has suffered heavy casualties since they arrived in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Many were injured fighting the Balaur and Asmodians, but we also suffered heavy casualties in Taloc's Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between you and me, it wasn't the Daevas of Life who discovered the Aether here...it was us, the Wisplight Legion. We were here first.</p>

          <p>It is indeed, Daeva. But in the process, I lost many good Legionaries. Not from battles, but from the bugs! We weren't used to their poisons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It takes some time for a Daeva's constitution to adapt to new surroundings...and ours haven't yet.</p>

          <p>It is becoming a widespread problem for Daevas here.... A cure should be on the way soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But since all the Guardians are still incapacitated, it is left to me to kill Seafoams. Blasted globs are almost as bad as the bugs!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Since you're here, would you mind taking care of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Foam_Wisp_52_n]s for me? They're not that strong, but there are many of them.</p>

          <p>Those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A3_Foam_Wisp_52_n]s stay airborne for some time....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But fortunately, we can use our wings around here since the area is abundant in Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just don't go out too far...the Aether forms in pockets. Sometimes you hit a bad pocket and simply fall from the sky.</p>

          <p>I pleaded with those tea-sipping Daevas of Life numerous times to find a cure for my injured Guardians, but they just shake their heads and shrug their shoulders.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They still haven't found a cure yet! What have they been doing out here all this time? Sipping that damn tea they love so much?</p>

          <p>Anyway, how did your extermination of the Seafoams turn out? The skies seem bluer since you first started.</p>
