          <p>My sister? She is still quite sick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On the days she can talk, she tells me about the Seafoams we used to watch in the fields at home. It makes me homesick.</p>

          <p>On summer evenings, we would run through the fields.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seafoams would be thick in the air. They would swirl around our heads, fly in our ears and tickle our whiskers! We would laugh and sing. We were happy...then. I think Setzkiki misses home.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you brought her a glass bottle full of Seafoams, I bet she would laugh! Can you do that? I would be so happy if she laughed!</p>

          <p>A glass bottle of Seafoams? I haven't thought of those in years! When I was little, we spent hours each summer chasing Seafoams around with little nets!</p>

          <p>I've got a glass bottle I can sell you, and I can fill it and cap it for you, but you'll need to go catch the Seafoams yourself.</p>
