          <p>I've heard you're quite the skilled Weaponsmithing expert for being such a newcomer to the craft. I bet you'd give me a run for the money, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, how about it? Care to try your hand at the Weaponsmithing Master test?</p>

          <p>High Priest Eremitia from the Cloister of Kaisinel has ordered a magnificent sword, the likes of which will strike fear into the heart of any enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you should make it, [%username]. There's just something about you, something I trust. I already have the design and prototype ready, so go speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nakia] up front and ask her for them.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll be making a greatsword to offer High Priest Eremitia, right? Then you will have to craft an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_19008]. Master Anteros has made two designs. They're both magnificent and worthy of the High Priest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first one he calls Eremitia's Greatsword, and it's beautiful...but a bit tricky to craft. The other one is Eremitia's Noble Greatsword, which gives detailed crafting instructions. This one is a little bit more expensive, but as long as you succeed in crafting it, you'll always get a Noble item. Which design do you want?</p>

          <p>Do you believe in luck, or do you believe in skill? That's what you need to ask yourself. Because here's the bad news.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can only use Eremitia's Greatsword design once. Master Anteros cast a self-destruction spell on the design to prevent it from being abused by...well, those less intelligent than you and I.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although a bit more pricey, Eremitia's Noble Greatsword might be more economical in the end. See, Eremitia's Greatsword costs 251,000 Kinah, but Eremitia's Noble Greatsword goes for 334,500 Kinah. Each purchase includes an authentic prototype. Still want the Greatsword, or did I change your mind?</p>

          <p>The design for Eremitia's Noble Greatsword will cost you 334,500 Kinah, and the design for Eremitia's Greatsword is 251,000 Kinah. And with your purchase, we'll even throw in a prototype made by Master Anteros himself.</p>

          <p>Nakia should have explained it when she gave you the design and prototype. You have to use them both to make [%dic:STR_DIC_E_QUEST_19008]. Try it again and bring it to me.</p>
