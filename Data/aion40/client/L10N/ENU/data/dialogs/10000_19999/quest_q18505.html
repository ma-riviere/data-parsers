          <p>I received a new order from Verteron Citadel, [%username]. And since you've been involved in this operation from the very beginning, I'm hoping I can count on you to finish the job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between us, Sanctum was more than shocked that one single Asmodian could have created such a lucrative, illegal Odium operation...and get its labor right here in our own backyard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We believe Hamerun was aided by a Shugo. A Shugo we came to trust over the years. We don't know all the details yet...but we're close.</p>

          <p>No name on the Shugo yet, but an eyewitness description. He's not the big picture, though. Hamerun is. We need to break up his organization.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we let them be, they'll reorganize and grow even stronger...like a disease.</p>
