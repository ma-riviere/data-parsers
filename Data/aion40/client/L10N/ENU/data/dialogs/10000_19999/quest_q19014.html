          <p>Ahh, Arieluma. I'm glad you're here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I saw you working at an armor craft table recently. I studied your hands, your fingers...even your eyes. I watched the way you held the tools, carressed the metals. You have the gift, my friend.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think the time has come for you to take the Armorsmithing Master test.</p>

          <p>Well, it's not simple...but I've seen your work, I know you can handle it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need to make an exceptional piece of armor as an offering to the Temple of an Empyrean Lord. It must be strong, it must be beautiful, and it must be...worthy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about it...do you want to take the test to become an Armorsmithing Master?</p>

          <p>By the light of Ariel, you have perfect timing, [%username]! High Priest Eremitia has ordered a ceremonial breastplate...and I think you should make it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I already have a beautiful design drawn up, so just go to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Menomes] and ask him for it. Tell him you're there for the Master test.</p>

          <p>A breastplate design? A breastplate design? You're going to have to be more specific than that, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What size? What color? Like a one-piece or maybe some chainmail across the shoulders? I have about a hundred designs you can pick from....</p>

          <p>Ooohhhh, you mean Eremitia's Noble Breastplate? I was hoping someone would begin work on this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's not just the one design...there's two. Which one do you want? There's Eremitia's Breastplate, the basic design, which can sometimes become Eremitia's Noble Breastplate...if you know the ins and outs of making armor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or you can spend a bit more and buy the design for the high-end Eremitia's Noble Breastplate, which comes with very detailed crafting instructions, so you will always get a quality piece of merchandise, as long as you succeed in your crafting at all. It's a bit more costly, but it's worth it.</p>

          <p>You're either confident in your skills or confident in your luck, Daeva. There's also a little catch with that one. Basically, you have one attempt at making it...that's why it costs less. Master Vulcanus cast a self-destruction spell on the design. I don't think he trusts me, to be honest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Might I suggest Eremitia's Noble Breastplate. It's a bit more Kinah, but it might turn out to be more economical in the end.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, what say you? Eremitia's Breastplate design for 167,500 Kinah or Eremitia's Noble Breastplate for a mere 223,000 Kinah?</p>
