          <p>There must be a lack of low-level Daevas out there, because they've asked me to continue my research duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you imagine that, [%username]? Keeping one of Sanctum's fiercest soldiers out here taking notes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I came here to kill Tiamat and his army, not dig up rocks. Eh, I guess every warrior needs a little break from battle now and again.</p>

          <p>Who else will be if I'm not? Listen, you helped me investigate the Sulfur Dragrints earlier, and you did a great job. I'm not sure if I mentioned that last time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I could use your help again. There are craters that emit acidic gas all around the Angrief Wastes. They melt everything...stink up the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to collect sulfur samples from these craters under various conditions. Can you lend a wing again?</p>

          <p>Faith and arms, [%username], that's great! I'll give you my collection toolkit to use. All you need to do is collect some samples in the bottles from the kit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've already put chemicals into each crater, so you can see the sulfur under various conditions. Depending on which chemical it was, you'll either see hardened or sticky sulfur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The craters are pretty easy to find; you'll recognize them right away. And thanks, Daeva. I'm sorry I was so rough on you earlier.</p>

          <p>So, you're just going to leave all the work to me then? I have to defend this post AND perform sulfur research?</p>

          <p>You should always stay alert when you classify sulfur samples...and do battle...and write your mission reports.</p>

          <p>Even when you're eating, sleeping, getting dressed. While I stand here talking to you, I'm actually acutely aware of everything going on around me.</p>

          <p>Hear that noise? I didn't need to...I saw it while I was looking at you. That's how good I am. Now that I have imparted my wisdom onto you, did you get my samples?</p>

          <p>Great job, Daeva. You have the potential to be a professional sulfur collector...maybe Inggison's finest! You even smell like one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I joke because I like you, so don't take it to heart. It's who I am. It's why I live alone, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In all honesty, thank you. I'm working on correcting my cynical nature.</p>

          <p>Totus's mission of researching sulfur was not over. He asked you to collect sulfur samples from craters at the Angrief Wastes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you collected samples from four craters. When you brought them to him, he was genuinely impressed.</p>
