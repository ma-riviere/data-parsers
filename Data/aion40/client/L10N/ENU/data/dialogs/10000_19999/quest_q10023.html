          <p>After receiving Brigade General Yulia's orders, you went to assist Sulla. When you returned to Sulla with samples he needed, he wanted to consult with Great Scholar Machiah, so you brought the weighty sample box to him, but Machiah said Pyrrha in Theobomos was the true expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Pyrrha saw the samples, she remarked that they were similar to Project Drakanhammer and must also be the remains of the giant weapon. You informed Sulla of this, and he told you to ask the Reian tribesman, Gelon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gelon said Titus claimed to have seen a Soldier of Aion in the Udas Temple, so you went to confirm Titus's tale. In the Hidden Library, you found a research log. When you reported back to Brigade General Yulia, she commended you for making an astonishing discovery.</p>
