          <p>I hear there were living sacrifices made at the Altar of Avarice. The Temple of Scales...I dunno. My guess is that's where they did actual worship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, I've got a couple of friends who're really near both places....practically in sight! They'd help you out if I asked them.</p>
