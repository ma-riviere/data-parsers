          <p>She experiments with different ingredients.... I have no idea what I'm eating most of the time. Some of the things she uses are poisonous to animals, but she says they taste good, so she uses them.</p>

          <p>The other day I tried her mushroom soup and my tongue went numb for three hours! I had to lie down the rest of the afternoon!</p>

          <p>Look at those Wraithlings over there. They look like normal trees, but then they attack Daevas when they get too close. I was supposed to get rid of them last week, but I was bedridden the entire time.</p>
