          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Did you know that plants are very sensitive to changes in their environment?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sometimes they'll adapt and thrive, while other times they'll simply die off. Dragrints are a good example of the former....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They can adapt to Drana, as my notes have noted. But they can also adapt to strong amounts of sulfur. Even acidic sulfur, like around here.</p>

          <p>Indeed, very interesting. Excellent for research since the sulfur here is caused by Tiamat. But Sulfur Dragrints are actually quite tame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm getting soft, I can feel it. I need a more powerful foe to challenge or I'll become as weak as...as weak as you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, powerful Daevas need to fight powerful enemies, and weak Daevas...well, you know. So, I have a mission for you...you're perfect for it.</p>
