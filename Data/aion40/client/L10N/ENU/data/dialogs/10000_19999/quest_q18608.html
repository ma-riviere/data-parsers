          <p> </p>
          <p>You could melt it down and use it to coat the Sword of the Judge, you know. You'd walk away with one very strong weapon!</p>

          <p>Ha! Knew I'd catch your attention.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll need three things to achieve it: Kromede's Tear, the Sword of the Judge, and a very talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first thing and, in me, you have the third. Now you just need the Sword. If you can get it, I'll take care of the rest.</p>
