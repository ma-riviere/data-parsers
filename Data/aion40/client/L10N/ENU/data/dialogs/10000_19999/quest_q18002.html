        <p>If only we had the Rune Tribe research journal, we would figure out how to make and use Idgel. But the Beritra folks took it all away.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>The most important journal of all is said to be with the Beritra Research Center Chairman. And he's so difficult to catch. </p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>He's so quick that he disappeared into the exit in the Idgel storage.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>It seems that you will be able to catch the Research Center Chairman when I consider your ability, [%username]. What do you think?</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Could you bring me the Rune Tribe research journal that the Beritra Research Center Chairman possesses?</p>
