          <p>All right, so I scratched off Moonflower Leaf from my list of possible ingredients....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm, what can I try next? Well, I know the tentacles of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Shellizard_Feeler_51_An]s are used to catch fish. And it doesn't kill the fish!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Might as well try that next, huh?</p>

          <p>But one thing that concerns me is that Ksellids are extremely sensitive to their surroundings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Shellizard_Feeler_51_An] that grew up here in Aether-deficient Inggison.... I wonder if it's still edible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know you're still a little ill from my stew, but would you find me some Ksellid tentacles? I'll make it up to you, I swear. This dish will be amazing!</p>

          <p>So, I'll need 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Shellizard_Feeler_51_An] tentacles. I need to confirm that it's both edible and safe.... I don't need the death of a hundred Legionaries tainting my spirit for eternity.</p>
