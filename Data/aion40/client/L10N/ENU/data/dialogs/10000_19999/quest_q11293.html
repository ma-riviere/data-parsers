          <p>Nooooooo! Nonononono, this can't be happening! I thought this was going to make my career, that I'd really impress Agent Outremus this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, I used to be his secretary, reading all the obscure research on the Balaur, checking out ancient documents from the Library of the Sages, but when we came to Balaurea, he decided that it was time I took what I'd learned in all those hours at my desk, and put it into action.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first, it was fun. Fresh air, exercise, and getting to apply my knowledge first hand. But now I've made a terrible mistake, and it could cost us everything!</p>

          <p>See, I thought... Oh, I can barely say it. It's so embarrassing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I thought that when you kill the Dramata, the spawn couldn't possibly hatch without it. No Dramata, no new eggs, nothing to incubate the spawn. Easy, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only, it turns out, the Dramatas just lay their spawn, and the Protectors are the ones who hatch them. Normally the Dramata is irrelevant after the eggs are laid, but Padmarashka got unusually protective, and that fooled me. Now I have to try and fix this mistake before it comes back to bite us.</p>

          <p>I'll take care of the spawn itself, but I can't take on all those protectors alone. My plan is for you and your friends to kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Q11293], while I sneak in behind them and get the spawn out of the cave.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to hurry, because those eggs won't stay unhatched forever!</p>

          <p>I know, I know. I made this mess, so I should really try and clean it up myself. I wasn't planning just to send you in there and wash my hands of it, though. I meant to help you by taking care of the spawn while you had that Protector distracted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose I'll just have to brave Outremus's disappointment, and write to him for assistance.</p>

          <p>That... was... awesome! Did you see me in there? I bet you didn't!</p>

          <p>You and your buddies had the Protector all distracted, and I just snuck right in there and grabbed the spawn! They're toast now. No, literally--I got my sorcerer pal to use Flaming Meteor. Oh, what a relief!</p>

          <p>Jamia asked for your help in fixing a mess that she'd inadvertently caused. She mistakenly believed that Padmarashka's spawn wouldn't hatch if Padmarashka was dead, but apparently the Protector can hatch it.</p>

          <p>While you took care of Padmarashka's Protector, Jamia snuck into the cave and stole Padmarashka's spawn so that she could destroy it.</p>
