          <p>Blast those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T3_Troll_Rage_58_An]s! I hope they get get stuck in lava! What could they possibly want with my seismonitors?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't imagine what they're doing with them, but every time I install a seismonitor, they chew through the casings.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least I can fix those--it's the ones that they steal that really irritate me. What are they doing with them, anyway? They can't taste good!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm a scientist, not a sprinter, and I am tired of chasing those idiot Trollpins down. Could you do me a favor and get rid of them?</p>
