          <p>The Heart of Wrath! Finally! Tiamat must be fuming now that we've captured one of his personal fortresses! Of course, that means we've gained his personal enmity as well. He'll soon be sending some of the creatures to soften up our forces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Volcanic Kerubiels are his creature of choice at the moment. He's probably planning to send in stronger troops once we're exhausted.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't let it get to that point. Kill the Volcanic Kerubiels, and you'll kill Tiamat's plot in its tracks.</p>

          <p>Tiamat's strategy is basic, but effective. Unfortunately, the Balaur have the numbers to pull it off very well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why killing Volcanic Kerubiels now is so important.</p>

          <p>Indeed. Tiamat will now have to expend even more resources to take back the Heart of Wrath. That can only be good for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our chances of victory here have just improved, and all you needed to do was kill a few Sapiens. Such is the way of war.</p>

          <p>Upon request, you killed Volcanic Kerubiels to make life easier for the Elyos troops there.</p>
