          <p>Finally, after all your trials and tribulations, the door to [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel] is open!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is just one thing left to do, my friend. The elders, who were so vehemently against your entry, need to be informed that you have passed the Koligran.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I angered them so much that they are refusing my council, and are now communicating through [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kutos]. You must tell him of your successes so that the elders can authorize your entry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your Elyos past is behind you now, [%username]. You have bonded with us Reians in a way that we never thought possible. Faith and arms will no longer be your mantra, my friend. Congratulations!</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was told that you'd been given the Koligran! Is that true? You have no idea how much of a ruckus this has caused. Kahrun and the elders are barely talking, and our council has been debating your case for weeks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So... is it true? Did you take the Koligran?</p>

          <p>Incredible! I remember when you first came to Sarpan, wide-eyed and simple... but... but look at you now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have changed everything, [%username]. Reian culture will never be the same again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will speak with the elders now. They gave their word that they would approve your entry once you had passed the Koligran, though it's fair to say that none even thought you'd attempt it. Please, return to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun] and tell him that the elders have approved your entry in Siel's Spear. And congratulations!</p>

          <p>After finally completing the Koligran, Kahrun told you that you would have to inform Kutos of your work, seeing as the elders had stopped talking with him. You met with Kutos, and though he was surprised that you'd passed, he tells you to return to Kahrun, knowing that the elders would have no choice but to accept your new status.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned to Kahrun and were accepted as a member of the legendary Siel's Spear!</p>
