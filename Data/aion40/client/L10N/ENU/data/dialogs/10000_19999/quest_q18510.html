          <p>I heard you handled Haramel extremely well, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And you managed to make Hamerun disappear and leave his little Odium operation drifting on the wind? Impressive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've sent some soldiers in to clear away some of the wreckage you left, but we still need to dismantle this situation from the ground up.</p>

          <p>Well, Haramel is much bigger than I first thought. A lot of Kinah got poured into that operation. There's state-of-the-art equipment all over the place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My first thought was to kill off all the Dukakis and Skurvs there, but then anyone could come in, take the equipment, and start the operation someplace new.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What we need to do is destroy the equipment! Destroy everything! Burn it to the ground. Can you handle that, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Good, good. This Flame Orb will help you. It'll burn anything, even items that have Aether in them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first leg of this operation is to burn those Aether carts up, so they can't move anything from that location.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The second part is to incinerate all that bad Odella. It's tainted...dangerous. It's of no use to us.</p>
