          <p>Taking the Heart of Petrification is a great victory. It has opened up all sorts of doors for Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, we now have an opportunity to examine local environments for resources that would be of use to us. We've discovered that certain rocks have a unique type of Aether. Unfortunately, they're also a favorite food for Crystalump Basilisks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you can get rid of Crystalump Basilisks, we'd be able to take more of those rocks for study.</p>

          <p>Certain Alchemists I know are extremely excited about the rocks around here. That's reason enough for my interest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it'll take a while to do the necessary research as long as Crystalump Basilisks are eating those rocks.</p>

          <p>Perfect! I didn't even know those sharding things ate rocks until recently. But at least they're dealt with now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for helping us, [%username]. I'll let you know if the research bears any fruit.</p>

          <p>Mikena discovered that rocks near the Heart of Petrification contained unique Aether. They were also the favorite food of Crystalump Basilisks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus, you killed Crystalump Basilisks so that there would be enough rocks for the Alchemists to study.</p>
