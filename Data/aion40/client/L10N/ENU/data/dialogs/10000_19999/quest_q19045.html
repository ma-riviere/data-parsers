          <p>So, are you feeling more confident about your pet raising skills now?</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>The most important thing to remember is to constantly interact with your pet. You need to keep reinforcing the bond between you, to keep your pet emotionally healthy.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>And, quite frankly, it's just fun.</p>

          <p>Now I've always been a good listener. People, pets, it doesn't matter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sit, I listen, I don't judge, and folk leave feeling better than when they arrived.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But sometimes, when my Ribbit is upset, even talking and snuggling isn't enough to shake him out of his bad mood.</p>

          <p>It makes me feel like such a failure. I hate not being able to comfort him!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think I'll go talk to [%dic:STR_DIC_NPC_Amis] about it. She has tons of pets. I bet she'll have some ideas on what else I can do for my Ribbit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why didn't I think of that before? She's a great pet fact resource. You should go talk to her too, [%username]. I bet she can give you a few more pointers.</p>

          <p>Ah, you've been talking to Unos. It is important to reach out to your pet, let them know you love them. But it's also good to let your pet bolster your spirits when you're down. They like to feel needed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you're feeling emotional, talk to your pet. They're great therapists.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I find that there's very little that a game of catch, a wrestling match, or even a trick teaching session won't fix. The exercise and companionship can squelch even the worst of moods.</p>

          <p>Here, check this out. This was written by a friend of mine and I think it will help you get what I'm saying.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Pets thrive with owners who care for them and play with them. They'll repay your time and emotional investments with love, and occasionally little gifts.</p>
