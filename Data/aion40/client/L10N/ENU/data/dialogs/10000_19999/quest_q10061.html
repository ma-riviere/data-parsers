          <p>Garnon speaks highly of you, Elyos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope there is more to you than pretty white wings and other people's praise, [%userclass]. There won't be any room for error when we move on Tiamat's Hearts.</p>

          <p>We're working out the logistics of an attack on the Heart of Gravity now, and Garnon is ironing kinks out of some kind of plan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until then, you can get to work proving you're as good as she says. There are three creatures out in the Lunatic's Rift that keep stealing supplies from our transports. Go out and destroy [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Monster_M_ElementalAir1], [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Monster_M_ElementalAir2], and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Monster_M_ElementalAir3].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By the time you dispatch all three of them, Garnon should be ready. She'll meet you at [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T2_S12], near the Heart of Gravity. Think you can handle that?</p>

          <p>Ah, [%username]. Good.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've gotten some useful intelligence from the Aetheric Monitor at the Heart of Fissure. The power fluctuates quite dramatically, cycling between the four Hearts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All we have to do is time our attack for when the power at this Heart is weakest.</p>

          <p>Well, we shall see. I plan to use my own magic against the Heart of Gravity as a test of sorts, to see if I can cast through the Heart's defenses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur will, of course, notice, and while I'm busy with my spell, I'll need a guard.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's where you come in, [%username]. Protect me from the Balaur while I cast my spell. </p>

          <p>Not your fault, [%username]. It was stronger than I thought... Well, I should know better than to underestimate Tiamat, shouldn't I.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ouch, and there was some kind of recoil, too. It stings!</p>

          <p>I'm fine. Well, I guess that's the end of our test.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It seemed to be working at first, but as soon as my magic reached through the outer barriers, the power surged up to meet me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're getting something wrong... Clearly a direct attack won't work here. Thanks for your help, but you can head back to Rancora Fortress, [%username].</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon recommended you to Adella, who wasn't sure if she trusted you. You killed Quixoren the Evasive, Sanstorn the Persistent, and Dulsina the Typhoon to prove your skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After, you met Garnon on the overlook above the Heart of Gravity, where she was preparing a test against the magic field around the Heart. She asked you to protect her while she cast her spell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon's attack was ineffective, proving that direct magical assault on the Hearts would not work.</p>
