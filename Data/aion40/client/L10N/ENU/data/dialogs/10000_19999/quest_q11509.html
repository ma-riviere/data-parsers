          <p>Ah... that a Daeva, whose scent I do not recognize and whose charity confounds me, should happen upon this situation at this very time... that cannot be simple happenstance. Destiny herself sails me towards my one true love, and you, my dear Daeva, are her captain!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Aurio]! The sun cries at your name, for it is too far away to embrace you. But not I, not I! We will soon be intertwined, and grow old together like twin trees. If only the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11509all] could see the brilliance of our love! Hoo! The power of it stirs the winds and shakes the earth!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But no. [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_03] is run by the one-eyed, and protected by the blind. Perhaps you, my dear Daeva... perhaps you could remove these obstacles, and unchain [%dic:STR_DIC_E_ldf4a_Aurio] and I from the fears of our peers?</p>

          <p>Every passing minute weeps that it did not better facilitate my love for dear Aurio!</p>

          <p>And what of you, Daeva? Did you help? Have the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11509all] been shown the power of true love? Speak now!</p>

        <body>
          <p>You are not the first to ridicule me, Daeva! But courage shines not through what all can do, but the few. I have the heart to challenge the will of the "wise" when most simply bend to their will, and, if time is the true test of our actions, then I have full faith that mine will be proven true.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, truth lies in the heart of your words, Daeva. The Strigik numbers are fewer than they once were, though they will be soon replaced. Other avenues must be explored, for resistance still stands high and mighty, and walls away my love.</p>

          <p>Aurio and Owllaet were two simple Strigiks deeply in love with one another, but who could not marry because their families were sworn enemies. However, Owllaet was determined to defy tradition, and asked you to eliminate the nearby Strigik Soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned and received her thanks, though it seems she has more in store for you.</p>
