          <p>No, no, no! Oh, you silly [%userclass]. Only a master craftsman can combine these two.</p>

          <p>You just go on to Sanctum and meet up with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis]. He'll take care of you for a moderate fee--probably around 8,000,000 Kinah--or he'll...he'll...he'll be a shady, dark-loving thing.</p>

          <p>I remember when I was younger and more romantic. I believed everything was perfect then, the way it was in Artisans Hall where Anusis and I crafted together.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We made designs together, ate together, laughed together.... It was a golden time for me. But he would get impatient, and I would get sad.... Then I moved out here, older and wiser and far away from Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let his impatience bother YOU. No, you are a paying customer, and Anusis will do right by you.</p>

          <p>Yes, I can combine Laestrygos's Polearm and a Piece of Aegis for you, but it requires detailed work and will cost you 8,000,000 Kinah. That's a firm number, and I've already brought the price down since you're a friend and all. Well, Laestry's friend.</p>

          <p>Most craftsmen can go fifty mortal lifetimes before seeing a Piece of Aegis. Wow. Look at the colors. If you just reach out and.... Oh! Oh! Hello there, Aegis.</p>
