          <p>Greetings, Elyos. I have been watching you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You fight the Dragonbound as if the Aion himself swung your sword.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I lost my entire family to the Dragonbound, and yet my rage is but a fraction of yours.</p>

          <p>I would love to kill every single Dragonbound walking this foul land, but I hesitate. You see, I believe my family is among them...my beautiful wife and child. They were brainwashed, like so many other Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deep in the recesses of the temple, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticFi_NamedQ_54_An] and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B6_FanaticWi_NamedQ_54_An] continue to brainwash my people, turning them into walking corpses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must get rid of them...but I...hesitate. My friend, would you do my people a great justice by killing Herefodus and The Dragonkissed?</p>
