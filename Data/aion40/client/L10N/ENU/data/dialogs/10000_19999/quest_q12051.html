          <p>The Reians may insist we and the Asmodians coexist, but that doesn't mean we necessarily work together. Take the Basrasa Legion Garrison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's ban on hostilities doesn't extend there, so we and the trogs are constantly tripping over each other.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_NPC_Q12051A]s are the worst, thanks to their Hide ability.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Chewing on this Seed of Detection will penetrate that ability. I want you, [%username], to eliminate the brutes for the good of Atreia.</p>

          <p>In war, it's either kill or be killed. Kahrun doesn't understand that. I hope he wises up before he learns the hard way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you been to the Basrasa Legion Garrison? Did those Half-Draks fall under Elyos might?</p>

          <p>The Seraphim Lords smile upon those who aid Elysea's cause, [%username]. You are doubtless a prime example.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Our diplomats are working to persuade Kahrun even now. Perhaps we'll get somewhere once Tiamat is defeated.</p>

          <p>Aranon complained that Asmodian scouts in the Basrasa Legion Garrison were getting in the way of Elyos Daevas in their missions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to the garrison and got rid of Asmodian Vanguard Scouts for the future of Elysea.</p>
