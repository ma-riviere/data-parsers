          <p>Oriel's seasons flow with ever-renewing vigor. Death and rebirth drench our city in Aion's splendor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can create amazing things with the power of the seasons, which is why I'm scouring for plant leaves containing that Aion-blessed energy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I don't have enough. Would you bring me Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter Leaves?</p>

          <p>Here's my idea: It's a mixed-media landscape on canvas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The left side will start with Spring, and the right side will end with Winter. But it will all be the same scene.</p>

          <p>One Oriel year represented by a single piece of art. What do you think?</p>

          <p>Gauon had an idea for a mixed-media landscape, using leaves from all the seasons.</p>

          <p>You waited for each season to come, then collected leaves of spring, summer, fall, and winter.</p>

          <p>Gauon rewarded you as a not-so-secret incentive to bring him more leaves for his project.</p>
