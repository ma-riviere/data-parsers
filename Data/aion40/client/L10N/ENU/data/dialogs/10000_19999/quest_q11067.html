          <p>Take Lysan. If I was just free-flying Temenos, I'd leave him be. But as his commander, I have to make sure he doesn't do too much...or too little.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The other day he made a fuss, saying that his men can't do any mission right and he'd start doing them all by himself. How do I help him to delegate and let go?</p>

          <p>All right. We need a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Scorpion_Rough_54_An]'s Poison Sting to make medicine, but supposedly they're hard to get because of attacks by our enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What kind of excuse is that from Daevas who were specially picked and dispatched all the way out to Balaurea?</p>

          <p>Would you go get the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11067a]?</p>
