          <p>Seikin won't stop crying now! And it's all my fault. Whenever I cry, he starts to cry.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He takes care of me so well, but he's having such a hard time lately. He tries to be mother, father, and brother...all at once.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was so cold last night that he even took off his clothes and covered me in them. He was shivering all night beside me.</p>

          <p>I want to make a special bed for him, to show him how much I love him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we were children, we watched our mother and father make a bed with tree branches and feathers. And they hung it from a tree.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was so soft and fun sleeping from a tree. I want to make this bed so Seikin will always be comfortable. Will you help me, Daeva?</p>
