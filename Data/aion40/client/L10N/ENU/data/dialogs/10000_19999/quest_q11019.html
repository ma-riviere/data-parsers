		<p>Arieluma, Daeva. Please, look around. It's been so long since I've had a customer...seems Mithril coins are a bit harder to come by these days.</p>

		<p>I guess the battles in Inggison are getting tougher and tougher, eh?</p>

		<p>What can I help you find? How much Mithril are you looking to part with?</p>
