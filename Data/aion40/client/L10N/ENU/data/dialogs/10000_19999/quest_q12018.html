          <p>The Seil's Temple Ruins were the site of a horrible battle. That's what the Reian legends say, at least.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm more interested in the hordes of undead that lurch around down there. The Reians try to just avoid them, since they used to be kin, but I don't have the same inclination.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those undead are terrifying, and vicious as well. And to top it off, they carry valuable [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_12018a]s that make good fodder for Manastones and Godstones. All the more reason to pick the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T4_YunFi_Ghost_59_An]s off, don't you agree?</p>

          <p>Aren't the undead the stuff of nightmares?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worth it, though, to get ahold of those Crystals.</p>

          <p>These are good, strong crystals. I bet they'll make killer Godstones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm not keeping them for myself. I'll distribute them throughout the Hushblade Legion. I will! Don't look at me sideways like that.</p>

          <p>They also carried Crystals that could be made into powerful Godstones, which you collected.</p>
