          <p>Arieluma, Daeva. Looks like Sanctum has finally authorized the use of those Aether Cannons! That should help our war efforts, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because of that, we've been given new orders. We're to drop all of our prior assignments and begin collecting Aether.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That used to be the duty of the Daevas of Life, but I guess they're not as efficient as everyone assumed.</p>

          <p>Well, their best is not good enough...apparently. That's why my Wisplight Legion has been called in to take over the search.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's a good thing! Now I can finally show my superiors that the Daevas of Life aren't the most important Daevas here. Not that we are either, but we're at least equals.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I am worried...we haven't fought in some time. We've grown a little slow lately. Our swords haven't left their scabbards in many days.</p>

          <p>I have heard that their hair holds large amounts of Aether. And since you'll be out there, could you also bring back a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_Junk_redeem_jewelry_02a] so I can refine the Aether?</p>
