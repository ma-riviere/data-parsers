          <p>Good news, [%username]. Lord Kaisinel is allowing Daevas to use the Arena of Glory. Now you can really show us what you're made of.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're looking a little pale, there. Daunted by the new arena? Well, as I've said before, if you can't handle the heat, don't take up the cooking profession.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you decide you're up to it after all, you can try collecting some Glorious Insignias and prove you aren't the mewling babe I think you are.</p>

          <p>Well done, [%username]. I was right--you just needed a bit of goading to achieve the next level of glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Walzen's set aside some rewards for those who achieve this, and I'm happy to award you this title. Please continue to set an example for other Daevas. </p>
