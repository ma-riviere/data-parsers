          <p>Have you been through the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_03]? Feathers flying everywhere... It's horrible for my allergies.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>But did you see the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LDF4a_FOBJ_Owlu_totem]s? They're very meticulous about protecting those things. I'm beginning to wonder if the Idols have some sort of practical purpose instead of just being religious icons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't test this theory myself--I'm busy with the Guardian Stone. And, like I said, I'm allergic to feathers. But there's no reason YOU can't do it. Could you destroy a couple of the Idols and see if Strigik behavior changes?</p>

          <p>I've been stationed here for so long, I feel like I know everything about the Urugugu.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, when the Urugugu talk about "Mother," they mean the big tree where [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_05] is located. They think the tree is some sacred manifestation of Aion's generosity to their people.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't really see an appeal in worshipping a tree. What happens when the tree dies? Won't they all be devastated?</p>

          <p>Huh. I was certain I was on to something with that theory.</p>

          <p>Worysia, Guardian Stone Manager at the Western Guardian's Seal, asked you to help her test a theory about the Urugugu Strigik's idols.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You destroyed some Urugugu Idols, but the Strigik didn't seem to be affected.</p>
