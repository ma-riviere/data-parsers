          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. I have an urgent favor to ask of you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have heard from many Daevas that the Asmodians have found out about Silentera Canyon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this is true, they have a direct line right to the heart of our bases.</p>

          <p>Yes, exactly! That's why I'm asking for your help! It would be a disaster if the Temple of Scales and the Altar of Avarice fell to the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need you to get out there and do what you can to save our bases and help [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_2111_Boss_Li_1] the Agent. She will only lend her strength once we fail...once our bases are lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know she'll need the help of a great [%userclass] such as yourself.</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I knew I could count on you. But before you leave for Inggison Outpost, see Ordnance Quartermaster Jondas to purchase the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11129a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if the outpost has truly fallen to the Asmodians, use the Blessing of Concentration on Veille's Aether Concentrator.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Because if Veille's Aether Concentrator receives over 100 blessings, she'll be able to use the Empyrean Avatar...so perform the blessing at least 10 times.</p>
