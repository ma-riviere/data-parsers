          <p>Unfortunately, those orders are so old that I don't have the reward--Utsida's Noble Corundum Necklace--available anymore.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Getting it made costs 10,000,000 Kinah to the crafting commission! Can you believe it? I don't have that kind of money.</p>

          <p>I can, though, get them to make it for you, if you've got the coin.</p>
