          <p>Thrasymedes and Hygea spoke to me of your potential, [%username]. They said that you've been highly recognized for your skills in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let this go to your head. Every Daeva can learn more...every Daeva should learn more. War with the Balaur Lords shall prove this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must remain pure and humble, two traits we Elyos seem to lose as we age.</p>

          <p>While we were fighting the Abyss War, I think we forgot that our real enemy was the Balaur. Instead, we focused on the Asmodians. We grew complacent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the situation will change after Empyrean Lord Kaisinel makes his decision. We, the descendents of Ariel, will have to become stronger to fight for Sanctum without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Lords have ordered me to train my students at four Temples in glorious Sanctum to give them the chance to become stronger soldiers. How about you? Would you like to learn the teachings of the Temple of Life and gain new strengths in battle?</p>

          <p>What the Temples offer is a Greater Stigma. Following the Steel Rake incident, we saw their raw power in Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't simply bestow a Greater Stigma on every Cleric. They're too potent. You have to prove you are capable of wielding its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Cleric, you can use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ, right? Well, you must use this skill 10 times to prove that you are ready. Acheive this and then come back to me.</p>

          <p>We lost many precious gifts from our ancestors during the Cataclysm. We are blessed to still have Stigma.</p>

          <p>That's why the Temple of Life focuses on collecting and expanding Stigma for Clerics. We cannot let this mastery fall into the shadows like so much else has.</p>

          <p>I will now give you a Stigma that the Temple of Life has prepared only for its most prized students. It should prove helpful in your battles with the Balaur.</p>

          <p>Now go show those wicked Balaur the power of the Temple of Life! Show them the blood that spills when the righteous step into battle!</p>
