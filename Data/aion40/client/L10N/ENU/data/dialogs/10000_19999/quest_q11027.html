          <p>Have I even touched Drana yet? No! And I specifically came to Inggison to study it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Neither plant nor animal, not mineral nor energy. What are they exactly?</p>

          <p>But your curiosity is piqued? Of course it is. You're smart enough to appretiate the mystery.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's what we'll do. You go to Hikiron Farm and distract the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A2_LizardAs_52_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A2_LizardFi_52_An]s. Killing them is probably best.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>While they're busy with you, I'll collect Drana and soil samples.</p>

          <p>No. My research is what's going to win this war, with or without your help.</p>

          <p>Good job!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Actually, of course it wasn't. Killing Balaur was irrelevant. Distracting them while I collected the live Drana and soil samples was the important part. Try to show some brainpower here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This reward is for your misguided efforts, all the same. Perhaps we'll do this again sometime.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>So you went to the Hikiron Farm and exterminated the Balaur, allowing Ambred to collect Drana and soil samples.</p>
