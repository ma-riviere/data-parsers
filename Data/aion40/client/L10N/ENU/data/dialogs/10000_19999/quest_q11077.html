          <p>Have you read the reports coming in from the front, [%username]? The Balaur in Inggison, they're proving to be quite the adversary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the Aether here in Inggison, it's dicey. Makes for some tricky moments, I tell you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In this type of battle, a well chosen weapon is crucial. Yes... I'm convinced that we'll all want to be armed to our eye teeth before jumping into this fray.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May I inspect your weapon?</p>

          <p>Hmm...it's not half bad, but I think you'll need something with more punch...and I have just the thing in mind.</p>

          <p>If I make all the arrangements, would you be interested upgrading to a new weapon?</p>

          <p>Interesting. You seem to have developed a deep attachment to your weapon. I won't force anything on you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Um...not to pry, but you may want to talk to someone about that. Being so attach to an old weapon doesn't really seem quite...healthy....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you change your mind, just return and the weapon is yours.</p>

          <p>He's a bit of a lightweight as a strategist, but a mighty fine motivational speaker. Yep. Mighty fine....</p>

          <p>I don't store these on site, so you'll need to swing over to the Weapons Distribution Office to pick it up. You head on over and I'll let [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Drenia] know you're on your way.</p>
