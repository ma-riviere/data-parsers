          <p>As a result, the expeditionary forces have to take those Windstreams to get where they're going. The strong winds here help, but they're not very reliable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was one of our trusty Air Line maintenance soldiers who discovered this marvelous method of transportation...and saved our sunny backsides in the process.</p>

          <p>You have to see it for yourself. Amazing stuff. Go see Laokon, and he'll fill you in.</p>

          <p>I'd like every Daeva here to know how they work, and where they are. Laokon'll give you all the facts.</p>

          <p>Then I'll tell you what I've managed to figure out. These Windstreams--a name that I coined--they let you sail from one destination to another.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you know the air currents, you can reach the most distant places. But you've got to know when to jump out....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might end up someplace you've never been before...or crashing into something. Try one...but keep your eyes open when you do.</p>
