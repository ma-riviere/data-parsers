          <p> </p>
          <p>The village would like to encourage a long visit by the administrators who collect crowns and goblets, and give out Abyss Points in return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas will need to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_E_junk_town_upgrade_flower_soul] and bring it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Town_SZtownB5]. We hear the officers are partial to it, so any village who gives them enough essence will be rewarded with a visit.</p>

          <p>It would be nice to have administrators who collect Goblets and Crowns right here in the village, yes? Much more convenient.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Rumor is, we can entice some administrators here if we promise great reward. They love Flower's Essence, right? Everybody loves Flower's Essence!</p>
