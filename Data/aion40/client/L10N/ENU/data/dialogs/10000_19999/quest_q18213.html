          <p>We built the Crucible Coliseum over the rift, so our trainees would think whatever vileness emerged to be an illusion created for their training, and eliminate the threat.</p>

          <p>Junos was agitated by your discovery of an Asmodian Archon crest in the Crucible Coliseum, and sent you to show it to Inggril, who seemed troubled by the Insignia, and refused to say much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Instead, you brought the Insignia to Walzen, who reluctantly admitted that the Crucible was built on a rift that allowed real Asmodians--not illusions--into the Coliseum, as well as creatures from Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He insisted you destroy the Insignia, and swore you to secrecy.</p>
