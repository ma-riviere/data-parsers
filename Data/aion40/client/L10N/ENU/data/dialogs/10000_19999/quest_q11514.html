          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur, strong and deadly as they are, still require slaves to do the basic work in their bases and camps. What if... what if they were killed? The basic functions that keep any military establishment running will cease, and the Balaur bases would be left in chaos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want you to test my theory out, my friend. I want you to go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_D] and kill all the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_D_DragonFly_58_An] units you come across. Will you?</p>

          <p>Yazu believed the Balaur could be hurt by wiping out their slaves: the Leowasps, forced into the basic tasks that kept their bases and strongholds functioning. You left to test Yazu's theory, only returning once enough of the creatures had been slain.</p>
