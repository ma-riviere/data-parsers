          <p>Ohh, I know this Daeva! He's a Guardian of the Hushblade Legion. Last I heard, he was injured on assignment in Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope he's all right--I haven't seen him in some time. He has a wife and children too. Good thing you picked it up instead of just walking by.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know where his family lives. I'll bring this to them.... I'm sure they'd love to have it back.</p>
