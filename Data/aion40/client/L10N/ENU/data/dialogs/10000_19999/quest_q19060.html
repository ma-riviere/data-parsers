          <p>It's good to see you again, [%username]. We have done a great deal together, eh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've taught you a great deal as you've progressed, but I'm afraid our journey together must end. Your abilities now outweigh mine: there is nothing more that you can learn from me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you wish to progress further, you will have to speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Chatia]. She will be able to help a [%userclass] like you. All you need to do is take her this recommendation letter.</p>

          <p>You must recognize your own limitations, [%userclass]. I am Chatia, mentor to the most powerful Gladiators and Templars that the Elyos have to offer.</p>

          <p>Do not feel inferior. Many that I do not teach still achieve great things across the battlegrounds of Atreia.</p>

          <p>Boreas speaks so highly of you! That alone speaks volumes, and I will gladly accept you into my training program. </p>

          <p>Welcome, [%username]. I look forward to teaching you the skills that will help the Elyos cause.</p>
