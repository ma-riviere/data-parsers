          <p>Life is a challenge, young Daeva. Since you are here, perhaps you could assist me with one of those challenges?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some time ago, I was inside of Taloc and I met a rather scraggly Shulack tinker. I tried to approach him, to give him solace and Kinah, but he ran away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He has been weighing on my mind. Would you check in on him for me?</p>

          <p>The inside of Taloc is not exactly a thriving spot to run a business. There must be a good reason for his presence there.</p>

          <p>Are you implying that a Shulack is not worth the trouble?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We Elyos, we have grown quite supercilious. Looking down on the Shugo and Shulack, like they are just children who play at being adults.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Aion gave them sentience, just as he gave it to the Elyos. Does that not make them worthy of our respect? Ponder that for a while, young Daeva.</p>
