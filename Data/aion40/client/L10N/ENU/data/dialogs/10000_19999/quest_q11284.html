	<p>Have you brought me Ancient Seals, [%userclass]? I have plenty to do, and don't have time to entertain idle banter.</p>

	<p>Hmph. Lesser Ancient Seals are barely worth my time, [%username].</p>

	<p>Hmm, standard grade seals. Not bad, [%username], not bad.</p>

	<p>Well, here's your reward. You should let me know if you find any more of these, you know. I'll reward you for every batch of ten that you bring me.</p>

	<p>Hmm! Greater Ancient Seals.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>See these details here? This level of detail isn't commonly seen, you know, and helps differentiate between greater seals and junk seals. I'll have these sent to Sanctum right away.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you, [%userclass]. Here's your reward.</p>

	<p>W... Well! I must say, I am speechless!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These are Major Ancient Seals, incredibly rare items that grant us a unique glimpse of the world that existed before us. They warrant the maximum reward I can grant, so rarely are they seen.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you for bringing these to me, [%username]. And... and my apologies for being so short with you before.</p>

	<p>The Ancient Seals are vital treasures that show all in Sanctum the values and knowledge of our past.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>We've decided that these items are so worthwhile that we can reward those that bring them to us with Abyss Points, the value depending on the quality of the seal.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I hope you appreciate your reward as much as we appreciate the Seals we get..</p>

	<p>You fool. You don't have the required number of seals on you.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>I told you not to waste my time, [%userclass], and what do you do? Ugh. Remember, Ancient Seals are classified into four grades: Major, Greater, Standard, and Lesser. I'll only accept the seals once you have ten of the same quality.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Pathetic. Now go away.</p>
