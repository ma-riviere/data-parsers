          <p>No, no, no...that would probably be easier to treat. This illness stems from some kind of insect bite from Taloc's Forest.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sent some soldiers out there to explore the forest, and they claim a swarm of bugs attacked them. They were fine when they got back, but they've been dropping one after the other since yesterday.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I examined a few of them, and their bite marks had swollen up to the size of Kinah coins.</p>

          <p>That's the problem... They're getting worse! They complain of fever and weakness. They also have fits of coughing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Getting inventive, I tried applying purified Aether water onto the wounds...but it did nothing. Then I heard from someone that crushed young Elim leaves might work.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But, as you can see, I can't leave here.... Would you search for these leaves for me?</p>

          <p>Atreia's too far from here...so please bring back [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_11450a] instead. It should work the same, since Taloc is from the Elim family as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But Taloc's leaves...do you think there's a risk of catching some strange disease from its leaves? I've heard stories from passing Shugos about Taloc's...tainted danglings. That's what they call them, at least.</p>

          <p>Hmmm, these leaves look a little different from the Elim leaves in my village. It should be all right, don't you think?</p>

          <p>Still, I'll clean them thoroughly in purified Aether water before crushing them into paste.... Aether water will purify almost anything.</p>
