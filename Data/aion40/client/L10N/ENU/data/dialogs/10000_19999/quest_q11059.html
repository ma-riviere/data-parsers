          <p>As Empyrean Lord Kaisinel warned, this red light means that something is wrong...something wrong with Protector Omega.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps he is dead. And perhaps it was you that killed him, [%username]. Here, I was told to give this orb to whoever slays Omega.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's the orb that Lord Kaisinel uses when he issues his special orders. If you look into it, you will receive his message.</p>
