          <p>Harknes told me the materials you brought were exactly what we need, [%username]. Thanks for picking them up. We won't forget to repay you when the results come in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With all the pressure I've been under lately, it's nice to know at least one thing is sorting itself out.</p>

          <p>They're mostly personal matters...but I do have one Alchemical issue you could assist with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To make an Illusion Sphere, I have to first cure Elemental Stone Powder in a shady spot. The Sphere's quality depends on the length of that process--not too long, nor too short.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The curing is just about done at this point. Can you recover the powder?</p>

          <p>Thank you! Thank you so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The powder is inside [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_LF4_FOBJ_Q11004A]es, which I've laid out throughout the Wildheart Grove. Don't open them up--just bring me the pouches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, I also need [%dic:STR_DIC_I_al_part_stone3_04a]s. They form in Greater Elemental Water, so you can extract some yourself, or get an alchemist to do it for you. Sound good?</p>
