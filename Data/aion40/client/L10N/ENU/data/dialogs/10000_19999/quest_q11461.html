          <p>Ah! Perhaps I do! There is a book...Daeva like books! Dorkin knows where a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Book_Q11461] is...sort of.</p>

          <p>Do you want to have a look? It might contain much information. If I tell you where to find it, will you keep my location secret?</p>

          <p>This other Daeva, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Marica], she left the book in my sleeping hole. It was too lumpy to sleep on, so I threw it away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I do not know exactly where it landed, somewhere by Taloc's Boughs. Daeva [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Marica] is mad she lost it. She is rude, so I do not tell her where I think it is.</p>

          <p>You should find the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_IDElim_Book_Q11461]. Take a peek inside. Maybe return it to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Marica]...or maybe not?</p>

          <p>That journal contains years of research notes! I've been trying to find it for weeks, but every time I stopped and asked that Shulack about it, he always said he hadn't seen it! Phony shade-loving roach!</p>

          <p>This is the diary I kept when I was investigating Taloc.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This one day, I was being chased by a swarm of bugs and I stuffed the journal into a hole to keep it safe. But when I went back for it, it was gone!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you read it? Wait, this isn't my book! I think it's a journal from an exploratory expedition to Taloc. I wonder who wrote this, and when? Hmm...interesting...I'll have to study this.</p>
