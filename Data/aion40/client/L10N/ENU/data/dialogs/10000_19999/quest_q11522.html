          <p>Hey, hey! Come over here! I've just received a report about [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A3_05].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Apparently there's a place in there called the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A09_pvp] that was created for dueling... and is outside of Kahrun's Will!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would be a completely useless report if the Asmodians weren't there, but according to what I've received, they ARE there, in significant numbers, looking for some kind of treasure!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is a perfect opportunity for us to remind the Asmodians just who we are, [%username]. You should go there, find some [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q30051]s, and kill them! Go! Faith and arms!</p>

          <p>The Asmodians must be easy prey for you, my friend. Reminding them that we can kill them whenever we want is not a bad idea in these strange, strange times. Good work.</p>

          <p>Enoa told you of a place named Hero's Discus in Ashishav's Nest where Kahrun's Will was ineffective, and Asmodians were crawling through the lands, looking for treasure. She suggested you head there, and kill the furbacks while you could.</p>

          <p>You completed the task with much aplomb.</p>
