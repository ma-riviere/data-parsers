          <p>The Cloister of Kaisinel, the Empyrean Lord of fantasy and fear, seeks your company. [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eremitia] herself, High Priest of Mirage, personally sent the message.</p>

          <p>Yes. That must be it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a request. It should be just the thing for a young hot-shot with something to prove. That sounds like you, correct?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you probably don't know, Empyrean Lord Kaisinel is not in residence just now. He's off fighting in Inggison, where there is a distinct lack of Aether. You will go help him.</p>
