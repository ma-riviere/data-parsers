          <p>Daevas started vanishing. Our swords and wings broke.</p>

          <p>For years untold, the remains of Siel's Spear led us. Especially Alphecca, the wise sage who helped us hold on to our identity.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But one day he went off to attend some business, and that was the last we saw of him. We wanted to search, but then the Elyos and Asmodians appeared--and the Balaur tightened their defense--so we couldn't spare the tribesmen.</p>

          <p>First you spoke to Gelon, who sent you to Jennathea at the Temple of Scales, who said Alphecca had been captured. You followed the trail to Hanarkand, where Alphecca told you he was working on a project.</p>
