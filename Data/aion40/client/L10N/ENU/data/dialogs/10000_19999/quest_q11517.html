          <p>Have you ever been beneath the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2], to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09]? The whole place is amazing, [%username]: a gargantuan series of hallways, with powerful yet intricate designs inlaid into every surface. Or so I hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, if only I could see those designs first-hand. If only I were strong enough to hold my own in that place. Instead, I am weak, and I am here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am forced to ask others to go in my stead, to defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_B2_Nepilim_R_58_Ae]s and steal their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11517A]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Will you help me? I will pay well.</p>

          <p>While you were gone, I got to thinking. I was wrong.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If I could go to the Studio myself, then I would have committed myself to a lifetime of training and discipline. I would therefore lack the knowledge I now know, and I would not care about the things in the studio that I now seek to understand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you see, [%username]? We serve the same purpose, just in different ways. We are two threads of the same rope.</p>
