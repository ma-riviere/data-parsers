          <p>It started when...right after I bought a fake Stigma from Herthia.</p>

          <p>I know that was stupid, but I couldn't afford a real one.</p>

          <p>Ohhh, I threw it away some time back. Right after the nightmares started. I thought it would make them go away, but they've only gotten worse.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Raninia said it's because my soul is too susceptible to influence...she told me I'd have to enter the nightmare to end it. But I'm so scared....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's when I overheard you talking, [%username]. You've already been inside Kromede's Trial, right? Would you go back in for me...get rid of this ethereal connection that binds me to their sorrow?</p>
