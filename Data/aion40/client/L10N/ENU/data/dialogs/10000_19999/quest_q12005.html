          <p>I want you to understand one thing: I don't like the Elyos. The Asmodians at least have been through hardship like we have.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've never met an Elyos who didn't treat me like dirt. What has your people done to deserve my respect? Hmph. Kahrun has ordered me to work with you people, so I must. But don't think this means we're friends now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My task for you is simple: kill those bothersome [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_MutantBeast_58_An]s. Think you can handle that, oh-so-rarefied Elyos?</p>

          <p>I have to admit, I didn't expect you to return.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What sort of excuse do you have? Was this task too mundane for your perfect Aion-blessed hands?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Or are you going to go on about how we Reians need to be more like you and solve our own problems?</p>

          <p>Y-you did? But... you're not bragging to me about your battle prowress and elegant fighting style.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I... I didn't expect the job to actually get done, certainly not by one of your kind.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll take more than this to persuade me of your worth, Elyos. But never let it be said that Reians do not keep their end of the bargain.</p>

          <p>Heros doesn't particularly like or trust the Elyos. He only gave you a task because he was ordered to by Kahrun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You killed Humpback Korbats anyway. It did little to resolve his mistrust, but he still rewarded you.</p>
