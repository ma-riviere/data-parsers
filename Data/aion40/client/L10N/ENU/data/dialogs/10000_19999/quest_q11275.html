          <p>I've been hanging out with the Shulacks lately, listening and learning.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With what I've heard, what we've been able to suss from tinkering, and from the intel arriving from Udas Temple, I've figured out how to open a new Stigma slot!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A bit of an ego hit having to admit I didn't figure it all out on my own, but I'll survive the embarrassment.</p>

          <p>It took a lot of Stigma Masters, Turners, researchers, and consultants, but we seem to have the process down now...mostly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll admit, it's still a little tricky...but if we succeed, poof! New Stigma slot!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yah, it's a bit risky, but what's risk to a Daeva? Do you want to give it a go?</p>

          <p>Alrighty then. First, you'll need to collect Ensouled Aether, which was formed and concentrated in living tissue. According to our research, Ensouled Aether can be harvested from the beasts of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_C5_Od] in Inggison.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can obtain it from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_Trico_55_n]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_Tricon_55_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_ElementalWater4_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C5_FlyingFoam_55_An]s. Oh, and you'll also need to pick up a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_MATERIAL_STIGMA_QUEST_01]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If this works, and I'm positively kind of sure it will, we'll crack open that new Stigma slot.</p>

          <p>Not interested in Stigma slots, huh? Really? That's kind of weird.</p>

          <p>Or do you just plan to try a different, less original technique?</p>

          <p>No, you don't have to try my new new process. You could head over to the Udas Temple and look for more clues. I hear there's some good hiking over there, and perhaps you'll find a simpler and more risk averse method to open Stigma slots. Maybe. You never know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's an awful long way to walk...and my process is sort of sure to work.</p>

          <p>Reemul suggested you to try his new method for opening a Stigma slot. You thought it sounded itneresting, so you brought him a pile of Ensouled Aether and an Aether Refining Toolbox.</p>

          <p>He told you to bring more. Anticlimactic, really.</p>
