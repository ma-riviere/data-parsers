          <p>Do you know why I trudge through Hanarkand Plains day and night? Relics. My guess is that something truly great is buried far below this ground.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Relics from the time when Drakan followed Aion...before Tiamat took over this land.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat...that beast is aggressive and cruel. Turned this entire place into his own personal battleground.</p>

          <p>But I'll never give up searching. It's in my blood as a researcher. I know I'll find something soon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I tell you, [%username], my research would be a whole lot easier if [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Ettin_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_EttinBig_55_An]s were not around.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Damn tree creatures...it's like they have a grudge against me. The Crettin Habitat should be my sanctuary, not my nightmare. Could you lend a blade, Daeva?</p>

          <p>Researching ancient relics is not easy, Daeva, especially for someone of my height.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Between angry creatures and greedy grave robbers, my days seem to be occupied by protecting myself...not researching.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, you'll dispose of those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_Ettin_55_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C4_EttinBig_55_An]s for me? That'd be a great help.</p>

          <p>You got rid of his enemies at the Crettin Habitat. And when you returned, he was happy and said he would credit you in any discoveries.</p>
