          <p>Raksang is unstable, in more ways than one. Tiamat created it without the slightest care for the ground above it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the most unstable regions is above the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDRaksha_2F]. Worse, its denizens continue to dig more tunnels!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At least, the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksha_2F_Spaller_56_Ae] do so. Who knows why.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Whatever the reason, they must be stopped, before the entire place collapses and takes parts of our lands with it!</p>

          <p>What's worse, since so many of those in Terror's Vault are ghosts, a collapse wouldn't hurt them one bit!</p>

          <p>Kenros said that Raksang verges on catastrophic collapse. The cause is underground excavation by Imprisoned Balaur.</p>

          <p>Convinced and horrified by his explanation, you eliminated the diggers, much to Kenros' relief.</p>
