          <p>So much for Elyos promises. You and the Asmodians are as bad as each other! You said you'd cooperate, but now you're at each other's throats as much as ever. Did you really think I'd never find out?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tiamat must be laughing at us now. All this squabbling merely plays into our enemy's hands!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Well, the time for the decisive battle is upon us, and I have decided that we Reians can no longer afford to trust you. We will defeat Tiamat alone.</p>

          <p>Don't waste your words. My mind is made up. It now falls to you to deliver this message to your superiors. Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LC2] and tell High Priest [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eremitia] of my decision. Don't worry, I'll be giving the same message to the Asmodians when they show their faces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will face Tiamat alone, and I will be victorious.</p>

          <p>So Kahrun has decided to go it alone. He can't seriously expect to triumph against Tiamat? Just imagine what will happen if he fails; Tiamat will overrun the whole of Tiamaranta once again, and what little territory the Reians have claimed will be taken from them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even worse, what if he succeeds? Then, the Reians will capture Siel's Relics, and solidify their power. We will never be able to defeat the Asmodians if that happens.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, I am glad you were the one to bring me this information. Perhaps with your help, we can turn this around.</p>
