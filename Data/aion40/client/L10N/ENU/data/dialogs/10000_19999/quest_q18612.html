          <p> </p>
          <p>But if you melt it down and use its power with the Tome of the Judge, it'll greatly increase the potency of the book's spells!</p>

          <p>Well, you'll need three things: Kromede's Tear, the Tome of the Judge, and a very talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first thing and, now that you found me, you have the third thing. You just need the tome. If you can get that, I'll take care of the rest.</p>

          <p>You should be thanking Ariel that you happened to find me, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I truly am one of the finest blacksmiths in all Elysea. So good, in fact, that I have even mastered the art of refining Tomes. I can even tell you where to start looking for it....</p>

          <p>You have nothing to lose, Daeva. The tome is with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae], at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. It's yours for the taking.</p>
