          <p>You've made quite an impression on Garnon, [%username]. She's asked for you to be assigned to her here in Tiamaranta as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've no idea what will happen when Tiamat falls, but for now, keep nursing this diplomacy. We need the Reians' trust, and I suspect the Asmodians are doing their best to turn our erstwhile allies against us.</p>

          <p>Our first steps into Tiamaranta are towards incapacitating the source of Tiamat's power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Dragon Lord has created an avatar, an Incarnation, to protect each of his power sources, which are located in the far corners of Tiamaranta. They await in the Heart of Fissure, the Heart of Gravity, the Heart of Wrath, and the Heart of Petrification. Only when those Hearts are incapacitated will the defenses around Tiamaranta's Eye falter so that we can enter the stronghold. There we will find Tiamat, and Elyos glory.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon can fill you in on the rest of the mission. You'll find [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_OP_A4] in Accord Square.</p>

          <p>Right: Fissure, Gravity, Wrath, and Petrification. And with the power to seal Siel's Relics, we can finally take them down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the Hearts are surrounded by some kind of Aetheric field that could prove deadly to our forces. We must assess that field before we move.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need an [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_10060b] to build a Vigilance Core, which will run our Aetheric Monitor. The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T1_Monster_M_Flyingeye]s carry them. Please fetch me one, and quickly! </p>

          <p>Very good. I've managed to summon a Magic Ward over the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T1_S8].</p>

          <p>Excellent. We must monitor that magic field for a while before we can move on the Heart of Fissure.</p>
