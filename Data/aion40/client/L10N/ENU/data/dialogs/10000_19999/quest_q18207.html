          <p>At ease, soldier. I called you here to answer some questions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've tried the Crucible Challenge before, yes? Have you ever seen a Balaur in there? No, no, it's not a trick question. I just want to know if you've seen one.</p>

          <p>No! You definitely should not! Inggril hasn't set up any rounds of combat in that arena that pit Daevas against Balaur. Still, we're getting reports from some of the Daevas that they've seen Balaur in there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There are only two conclusions: either those mudslimes don't know a Balaur from a Boggart, or some flesh and blood draks have found their way in. I need someone I can rely on to go back in there and eyeball the situation. What say you?</p>

          <p>Right-o. First, though, just go and have a chat with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Inggril] over there, see if you can get some sense out of her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She's in charge of the training program, but I can't make head nor tail of her most of the time. All we need to know is whether the enemy line-up has been changed.</p>
