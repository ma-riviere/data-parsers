          <p>I can understand how the Asmodians feel. I've never been around non-Reians before, so being here, with the Elyos, is a little uncomfortable. Not that my personal squeamishness matters, of course, not when the Naduka Legion is practically on our doorstep.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyone who kills [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanFi_Noble_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanSc_Noble_58_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanWi_Noble_58_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_DrakanCl_Noble_58_An]s has my respect. Elyos, Asmodian, or Reian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hmm. I hadn't meant that as a hint, but perhaps if you have the time, [%userrace], you could do such?</p>

          <p>I feel as though we have Tiamat worried. We must press aggressively if we are to turn that worry into fear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Taking down the Naduka Legion Garrison is a major step toward that goal. Have you done your part?</p>

          <p>Yes... defeating the Balaur is always a unique pleasure, isn't it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But it's all academic if we don't work in harmony--Reian, Elyos, and Asmodian. But with your help, perhaps, it may yet happen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you won't give up on this, [%userclass]--not until every last Naduka Legionary is dead.</p>
