          <p>Thrasymedes and Hygea spoke very highly of you, [%username]. They said you were quite the Chanter in Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let this go to your head. Every Daeva can always learn more...every Daeva should always learn more. War with the Balaur Lords will most likely prove this.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must remain fair and unpolluted in your beliefs...two traits we Daevas of the cloth seem to lose with each new day.</p>

          <p>While we were fighting the Abyss War, I think we forgot that our true enemy is the Balaur. We focused too much on the Asmodians and grew narrow-minded as a result.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But the situation will change once Empyrean Lord Kaisinel makes his decision. We, the descendents of Ariel, will have to become stronger to fight for Sanctum without the protection of the Aetheric Field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Empyrean Lords have ordered me to train my students at four Temples in glorious Sanctum. How about you? Would you like to learn the teachings of the Temple of Life and gain new strength in battle?</p>

          <p>What our training offers is a Greater Stigma. Didn't we see their raw power in action when we took care of Dark Poeta?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we can't simply give a Greater Stigma to every Chanter. They're too potent. First, you have to prove yourself able to wield its power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As a Chanter, you can use ㅇㅇㅇㅇ, I assume? Well, you must use this skill 10 times to prove to me that you are ready. Acheive this and then come back. Only then will you be ready.</p>

          <p>Although we respect every Daeva's opinion, you won't achieve anything in this life by claiming to know it all. You must continue to grow...continue to open your eyes and ears to everything around you.</p>

          <p>We lost many precious gifts during the Cataclysm. It is a blessing that we still have Stigma.</p>

          <p>That's why the Temple of Life focuses on collecting and expanding Stigma for Chanters. We cannot let this mastery fall into the shadows like so many others.</p>
