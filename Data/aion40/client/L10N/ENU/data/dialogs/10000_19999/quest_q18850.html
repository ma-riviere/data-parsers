	<p>Brought me Ancient Crowns, Daeva?</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Very important for SCIENCE, friend! Yes. And while some collect Ancient Crowns to sell them in illegal black market trade houses for millions of Kinah and live the life getting fur washed daily in own mansion with extravagant decorations and all kinds of mounts and rare pets and platinum glasses... not my dream at all. No no.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Doing all this for science, Daeva! Much more rewarding. Yes yes. Science. Not money. No no.</p>
