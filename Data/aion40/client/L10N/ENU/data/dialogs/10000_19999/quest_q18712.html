          <p>And there! Done! The Enchantment Stone must be combined with your sword soon, before its power is lost.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, as good as I am, I cannot work the stone for you. Plus, you know, I'm far too busy with my other tasks. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Seles] of Sarpan should be able to help you though. He's the finest... combining man I know.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go now. I hope you enjoy your new weapon!</p>

          <p>Almost every weapon can be upgraded, you know. It just takes the right enchantment stone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're all different, you see, and require a different stone in order to bring out the extra oomph that warriors like you require. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're not entirely sure why the stones are particular to the weapon. Some cite material affinity between stone and weapon, but no one has the proof needed to confirm.</p>

          <p>Silion's Sword and a Paruam Enchantment Stone! You are quite correct, my dear [%userclass]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just give me a moment to do my part, will you? I have to press this against this like... so, and then twist this... and... there! Done!</p>

          <p>Enjoy your weapon, my friend! It'll behave like a completely different beast now!</p>
