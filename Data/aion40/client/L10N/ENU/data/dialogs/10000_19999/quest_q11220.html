          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. It's great to see you in the Temple of Scales! Actually, it's just great to see that you are still alive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that the bloodshed has ceased for the time being, it's probably a good idea if we stock up on supplies and perform some maintenance tests on our defenses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can never be too sure...especially in this place.</p>

          <p>My thoughts exactly. The battle to take this place burned through most of our supplies. It's difficult to stay stocked up...since we're right here on the front line, foes to the left and right.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sanctum is too far away, and Inggison is almost as bare as we are. If we were to be attacked right now, I fear what would happen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], would you help me to get some supplies?</p>

          <p>What we need most are weapons and materials to strengthen the fortress walls...but we can't get either at the moment. But I've researched some decent substitutes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_DragonSnake_55_An]s near the Aetheric Field Observatory. Their skin is strong and durable...should do the trick.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a temporary fix but should keep us out of harm's way if the attacks comes. Can you find [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11220a] and bring some back here?</p>

          <p>Serrators are pretty rare in Elysea...at least ones with skin like these. I guess they've adapted to Balaurea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This should be enough to fix the fortress walls for now...to keep out the beasts for a little while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>On behalf of the residents of the Temple of Scales, I'd like to thank you, [%username]. We can't afford to give you much, but please take this....</p>
