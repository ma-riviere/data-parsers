          <p>Those village people...I don't hate them too much for kicking us out, I suppose. Everyone has to survive somehow...even Shulacks.</p>

          <p>The Balaur...they kill Shulacks for fun and for food. But sometimes they won't kill us if we sacrifice other things, like jewels, gold...or other Shulacks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like my mother. Those bad Shulacks in the village, they kicked us out. Then some of them told the Balaur where we were hiding. Setzkiki and I got away.... Mother did not.</p>
