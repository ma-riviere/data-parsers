          <p>Arieluma, [%username]. Dark days are upon us again. Drana energy is spreading from creature to creature, tainting everything it touches.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It has spread all the way to the Inggison Outpost. If we don't do something quick, we'll be doomed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to kill off every creature infected by the Drana energy...before it affects the Obelisks.</p>

          <p>You've been in Inggison for some time now...I'm surprised you haven't noticed it. It's bad...terribly bad!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What's worse, the creatures that get affected grow stronger, wilder. They attack with such ferocity now that even my most experienced Legionaries fall prey to their claws.</p>

          <p>What say you, [%username]? Care to lend your blade to a worthy cause?</p>

          <p>I've determined that the most dangerous creatures are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Xipeto_Drana_54_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B4_Crestlich_Drana_54_An]es, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B4_Kuillus_Drana_54_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Destroy as many as you can and bring me their mutated body tissue afterwards. I need to have a research team study them so we can find out just how bad this has gotten.</p>

          <p>The interest in these mutated creatures has grown dramatically over the past few hours. I've spoken with several researchers and even an Aether Maintenance Soldier since you've been gone.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They all want that body tissue for their research. I hope you brought them back...the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11125a]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11125b]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11125c]?</p>

          <p>Strange...they seem to have mutated more than I thought. Look at their abnormal forms, the putrification of their skin.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had no idea Drana could do something like this. Thank you, [%username]. You just might have saved all of our hides.</p>
