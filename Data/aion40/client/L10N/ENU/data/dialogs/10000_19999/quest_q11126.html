          <p>Young Daeva, I'm glad you're here. How experienced are you with Klaws? They are becoming a problem everywhere these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've seen many battles, friend, and my blade has severed many limbs...but these Klaws, they're a worthy adversary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I didn't watch my Daevas die face down in the muck fighting the Balaur...just to come here and let these Klaws try and take over!</p>

          <p>Yes, Daeva, a worthy adversary...even for a hardened soldier like myself. They're not like the Klaws in Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You see, they changed like most every other creature near Drana Farm. But they didn't mutate--they simply adjusted to the changes...adapted! They're of strong constitution, much like myself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A worthy adversary...that we need to now dispose of. I would handle it, but I can't leave my post...among other things. How about you, Daeva? Feel like killing Klaws?</p>

          <p>If you go to Klawnickt's Cave, you'll run into the Klaws I spoke of. They even attack the Balaur, so watch yourself...they're a worthy adversary.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You must kill all [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Neut_Worker_53_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B7_Neut_Fly_53_An]s in your path!</p>

          <p>I would join you but, like I said, I must stay at my post. It is very important that I stay here...orders from above.</p>

          <p>I didn't mean to frighten you with my warnings, Daeva. They are indeed a worthy adversary, but they can be beaten.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could use you out there...a strong [%userclass] like yourself.</p>

          <p>Ponder it, Daeva. I'll be at my post when you change your mind.</p>

          <p>Ahh, Daeva. I was just reading a thesis from a scholar on the ecology of Klaws.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They plague every land that has a name, yet they choose to reproduce here in this world without a soul.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you get rid of them? Was I right about them being a worthy adversary?</p>
