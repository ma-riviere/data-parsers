          <p>Lady of Light, how could this be!? The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A] is now in enemy hands. We have failed!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know the strategic importance of the Altar of Avarice, [%username]! Whoever controls that fortress also controls the heart of Inggison! We must hold our ground there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur are growing too powerful...and the Asmodians are pouring through Silentera Canyon as we speak.</p>

          <p>The worst-case scenario is losing both the Altar of Avarice and the Temple of Scales. If that happens, it's only a matter of time until the Angrief Gate falls to the enemy.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must reclaim the Altar of Avarice at all costs! Nothing is more important right now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must organize our forces and attack now! We must defeat their foothold by getting rid of their Guardian General and capturing [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A]! Can you help?</p>

          <p>You are a blessing to all Elyos, [%username]! I have asked others to help, but I don't know how much I can trust them in the face of danger.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You are quite legendary around here--use your reputation to organize a small attack group. Or join a faction already preparing for battle...it's up to you. Just get out there! We need you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At all costs, defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_QUEST_11201] and reclaim the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_2021_A] for all Elyos! [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ingnie] will soon be there--she will reward you for your service.</p>
