          <p>[%username]? Aren't you the Daeva who found out about Taloc? All those fragments of the Aion tower imbedded inside Taloc, and all those wicked creatures infesting the holy tree? That was you, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then you deserve to know what Sanctum is now doing. We were ordered to obtain Taloc's help by any means necessary. The Aether he has is essential to our survival...and he has a lot of it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without his help, the Aether Cannon is useless.</p>

          <p>They're not just rumors anymore! The Elim are of strong mind and spirit. Sometimes our goals mesh, and other times--most times--they don't.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Basically, he doesn't trust us. That's always been the problem. We tried to win his favor sometime before by removing the parasites from his domain, but Daevas aren't the best exterminators.</p>

          <p>We're launching a large-scale operation. We're calling it the Taloc Rebirth Operation, and our objective is to kill every parasite living inside Taloc once and for all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We have to do this, [%username]. Without his help, we have no chance in this war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I'm asking for your help. We need you out there. We need your [%userclass] skills for the Taloc Rebirth Operation. Can we count on you?</p>

          <p>That's good to hear! Although the name of the operation sounds rather provocative, it's really just a slice-and-dice job...the kind I'm sure you like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just go in and destroy every parasite you see inside Taloc. But there is one thing you must be wary of....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've heard that you have strong resistance to low Aether levels. But it's still not advisable to stay too long inside Taloc. Slice and dice, [%username], then get out!</p>

          <p>But this is our only option now. We need to get that cannon up and running, and trusting Taloc is our only choice in the matter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And besides, it's a straight order from Sanctum. It's above our pay scale to question orders.</p>
