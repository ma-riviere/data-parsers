          <p>Fine, nyerk! Haramel is place where Dukaki kidnapped from Elysea and Skurvs kidnapped from Asmodae are forced to make dirty Odium and Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Dukaki dig it, and Skurvs cultivate it. Haramel is bad place. Haramel extracts Aether and sells to both Elysea and Asmodae. Black market stuff.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a tower in the facility there, nyerk. Gestanerk knows more. Gestanerk is the Shugo you want...not Moorilerk. Moorilerk just a victim, nyerk.</p>
