          <p>It's frightening, yet exciting. This is our opportunity to avenge our recent losses and turn back the lawless tide.</p>

          <p>The Wisplight Legion moves against the Balaur and their Esoterrace, as many other legions do.</p>

          <p>Our resources are vast, but... With so many operations, we can't engage in all of them as we'd like.</p>

          <p>The Esoterrace is manageable, but the results would be even better with help.</p>
