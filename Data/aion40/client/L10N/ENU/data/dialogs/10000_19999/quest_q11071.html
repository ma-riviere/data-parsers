          <p>That was before the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Varanus_Axolotl_51_n]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They started out as aquatic beings, and then evolved into amphibious, slippery little things. Disgusting!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love to see Calmheart Grove again, maybe find a deserted temple, but these Vortiles! Could you lend me a hand?</p>
