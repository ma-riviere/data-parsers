          <p>I can't wait to find out what the Balaurean ones are like.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I just learned that the Supraklaw Shahs live in [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_B7_NeutCave] north of Mephistis Farm. I bet there are eggs in there, wiggling about, almost ready to hatch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you bring me some of those uber-cuties while I stay here and hold the outpost?</p>

          <p>Thank you, [%username]. I knew you'd be great about my having a hobby.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please get ten [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Neut_Egg]s. They won't all hatch, but we can't just grab them after they leave the egg. They need to be tamed before hatching, see?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you know, if you take good care of their eggs and if the babies see your face first thing when their eyes open, then they'll follow you as their mom.</p>
