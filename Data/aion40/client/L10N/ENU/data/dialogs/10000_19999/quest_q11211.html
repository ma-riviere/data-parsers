          <p>Eternal darkness on it all! Arrgh! I've really gotten myself into a bind this time, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I went to the Forest of Antiquity to start my research, but I was attacked by Drakes. Dozens of them! They came out of nowhere!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wasn't injured too badly, but they took my bag!</p>

          <p>It's not the bag itself that concerns me, it's what's in the bag! My notebook full of my Dramata research, an emergency potion...and some clothes are, er, special to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to get that stuff back! Losing that notebook alone will set my investigation back several months. I knew I shouldn't have packed my lunch in that bag. The smell must have aroused the Drakes.</p>

          <p>There in lies the problem, [%username]. I am needed elsewhere and I can't go looking for my stuff. The longer I wait, the further it goes. By tomorrow my bag could be miles away from here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you help me find it? I saw them tear through the bag, and my belongings flew everywhere. So you'll need to search the area carefully--everything is important.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There was a bunch of stuff in there, but I'd be happy if I could just get the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q11211A], [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q11211B], [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q11211C], and [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_FOBJ_Q11211D] back.</p>
