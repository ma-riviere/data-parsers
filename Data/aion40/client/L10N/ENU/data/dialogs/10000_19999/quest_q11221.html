          <p>Greetings, [%username]. We fought valiantly to win the Temple of Scales. Let me rephrase that--we, the Wisplight Legionaries, fought valiantly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That damned Expeditionary Force came in after the bloodshed and carnage stopped, but it didn't stop them from sharing in our glory. Tea-sipping novices!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It was wild out there. I got ambushed...they were everywhere! I took off and they started chasing me...I could feel the Dark Forever biting at my heels. But as I was running, a big sandstorm erased my footsteps behind me. Turns out it was [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Shadowstalker_Sand_55_An]s.</p>

          <p>In a way, yes. The enemy couldn't follow me, so I lost them. I never thought an Obscura would save my life. They're all right in my book.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I just got handed orders. It's something I can't do, but I was hoping you could. The same Obscuras that saved my life...now need to be exterminated.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Shadowstalker_Sand_55_An]s pose a threat to our security...at least that's what my orders say. Could you do this for me?</p>

          <p>Kaisinel doesn't have mercy for everyone, I suppose. But I see his logic. If the enemy realizes how the Obscuras helped me, they may use the same power against us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, you don't mind killing [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_C_Shadowstalker_Sand_55_An]s for me? I just can't, not since they saved my life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're near the fortress. And, if you could, bring back their strange dust so I can show my superiors? Blessed Ariel, this is a sad day to be a Daeva.</p>
