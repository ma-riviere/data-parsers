		<p>As a certified Mithril coin shop owner, I can only offer rewards to those with the proper attributes. Legalities, I know, I know....</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>For instance, I can't go and give a sword to someone who doesn't know how to use one. That wouldn't be right.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I think maybe you should go and find another store that's a little more your...how do I say...grade.</p>
