          <p>You think you're ready for the Crucible Coliseum, do you? Well, I certainly hope you're better than the last batch. Barely better than fledgelings, I tell you what.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even if you've been through the other Crucibles, you shouldn't take this challenge lightly. You won't be fighting Kobolds, Krall, or Balaur this time. You're up against Daevas like yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you think you're up to it, I'll introduce you to Training Instructor Junos of the Crucible Coliseum.</p>

          <p>I hope you're not here to insult me with some half-hearted attempt at real combat. So far this week I've had nothing but showboaters, posers, and bedwetters. I sent them back to Poeta with their fettered wings in tow.</p>

          <p>The Crucible Coliseum is made up of two different arenas. The first is the Arena of Discipline, where you'll fight opponents one on one.</p>
          <p> </p> 
          <p>The one still standing at the end is the winner. The fight lasts for 3 rounds, but an exceptional fighter may defeat their opponent and emerge the clear winner in a shorter amount of time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, take a moment to digest that, and come back to me when you want the rules for the Arena of Chaos.</p>
