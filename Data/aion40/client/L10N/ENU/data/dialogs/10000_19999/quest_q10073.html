          <p>Don't look so scared. We aren't going to hold you accountable for what happened to Siel's Relics. There's no point in pointing fingers. They're gone, and we have too much to do to cast aside one of our most valuable agents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, we do have a certain amount of damage control to do, after what [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Israphel] did.</p>

          <p>Even after all he's ruined before, we didn't believe he was capable of this.</p>

          <p>Just think what would happen if people found out.... People would become suspicious of all Empyrean Lords! Humans and Daevas would start turning away from them. Elysea would fall into chaos!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They might even start questioning Aion's judgment for sending us such a corrupt Lord. Yes, I think all in all it'd be better if people don't find out. Wouldn't you agree?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For all our sakes, we need you to sign this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10073a] to hold you to utmost secrecy. I'm not asking you, I'm commanding you in my capacity as High Priest.</p>

         <p>One more thing. A Reian delegation came to complain about the destruction of Siel's Relics. I assume you were the one who passed along this information?</p>

         <p>Well, it's too late for recriminations. I just want you to deliver this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10073c] to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kahrun] and convince him to keep his mouth shut.</p>

	        <p>Well, I hadn't exactly planned to tell the town crier of the depths of Israphel's treachery, so you can tell  [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Eremitia] that she doesn't need to worry that I'll talk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Honestly, I was thinking about kicking all you Elyos out of Sarpan, but I thought about what you'd done as a member of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_spearofCiel], and I reconsidered. Still, this is the end of our alliance, you understand?</p>
         	<p> </p>
          <p>Now, leave the letter with me. I'll read it over and send it to Eremitia.</p>

          <p>I don't think there's any hope of returning to the old alliance, but we can at least try and convince Kahrun to let you stay.</p>

          <p>I bet if you rid him of some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q10073a] of certain groups in Tiamaranta, he would remember all that you've done for the Reians, and that his anger is really about Sanctum, not you.</p>
