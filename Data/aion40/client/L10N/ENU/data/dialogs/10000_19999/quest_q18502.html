          <p>Moofrenerk is very happy with Daeva deal. I need to see the sun or I do not want to live.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This land around you is Haramel...where illegal operation goes down, nyerk. Haramel is a labor camp for Dukaki and Skurvs...forced to make Odium and extract Aether for the big bosses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you let Moofrenerk go now? Moofrenerk has said quite a lot. You see Haramel for yourself now.</p>

          <p>Oh, Daeva, you want blood from stone. All right...District 1 is where Dukaki find and process Odium. District 2 is for Skurvs to cultivate and process the Odella.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Odium and Odella go through chemical treatment...then put in box and moved to the tower, nyerk. Hear they use a pulley to take it there...but Moofrenerk never seen.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gestanerk runs the pulley, I think. Gestanerk is the Shugo you want. You find him, you ask him some more.</p>

          <p>Daeva and Shugo are even now, yes? Moofrenerk and brother are off the arrest report now, right? We give you the information you need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If...if you arrest Gestanerk, tell him Moofrenerk sorry. No...no, don't say anything. Keep Moofrenerk's name on the quiet side. He knows big Kinah Daevas everywhere.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And Daeva should be warned...Gestanerk is a runner. Fastest Shugo ever seen. So...Daeva and Shugo square now, yes?</p>

          <p>Gestanerk is not to blame, Daeva. Gestanerk a good, good Shugo...always on the up-and-up. I just work here, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva keep hands off weapon...hands off weapon! Okay, okay...I know, I know everything, nyerk! But Gestanerk just a low-level Shugo. Arresting me stops nothing!</p>

          <p>Daeva wants...Hamerun! Hamerun is the kingpin of illegal Odium operation. That is all Gestanerk knows, honest.</p>

          <p>Hamerun is a big, powerful, evil Asmodian Daeva. He is the kingpin. Gestanerk showed Hamerun how to brainwash Sapiens. We were partners in the beginning...now he make me slave, too.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Gestanerk is being honest with you, nyerk. Hamerun's on the upper floor. Take elevator and Daeva will find him. We square now, yes? Daeva let Gestanerk go, and Daeva never, ever see Gestanerk again. Honest.</p>

          <p>This is huge, [%username]! This could get ugly, especially since Hamerun got away. There's no telling who he might know...and how influential that friendship might be, see?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll send a squad out to search for Hamerun. You better hide before you get squeezed...and we'll both forget about our little Shugo informants for now. Here, take this. And thanks.</p>
