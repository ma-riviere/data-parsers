          <p>You're not going to have much luck shaking the Piece of Aegis in some voodoo ritual to empower your orb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No, you need a real craftsman.</p>

          <p>There is only one who Daeva can handle an Aegis Fragment: [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis], master craftsman of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the skills of such a great man don't come cheaply. You'll need at least--at LEAST--8,000,000 Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't recommend seeing anyone else. Your orb and Aegis could break--craaaack!--during the combining process!</p>

          <p>We were friends once, you know, in Artisans Hall. We ate together, crafted together, played together. For a while, we lived together too. Ah, those were sun-sparkling days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he would get impatient, and I would get sad. It was not good, was not healthy. That's why I came out here to live. I needed to get away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let his impatience bother you. No, YOU are a paying customer, and you couldn't ask for a better craftsman. Anusis is the best of the best.</p>

          <p>A Piece of Aegis AND a message from Laestry? This is better than Lighterica.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Mmmm, look at that gorgeous orb. Laestrygos always had an eye for detail. He made me these brooches, you know. I bet he doesn't wear the crude hair pin I made him anymore....</p>

          <p>Enough reminiscing! You want the orb and the Piece of Aegis merged, you give me 8,000,000 Kinah. Up front. And if you think that's too expensive, go find someone else.</p>

          <p>Most craftsmen can go fifty mortal lifetimes before seeing a Piece of Aegis. Wow. Look at the colors. If you just reach out and...oh! Oh! Hello there, Aegis.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Let me just close my eyes and commune. Mmmmmm. It's in my soul. I can practically feel the vibrations. And here's Laestry's Orb. It feels just like him.</p>
