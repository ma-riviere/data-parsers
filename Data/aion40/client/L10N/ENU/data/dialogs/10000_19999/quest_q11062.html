          <p>That Padmarashka still lives? Yes... it's true.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Her will is as strong as her form, it seems. And, as long as she breathes, she'll spawn the Drakan terrors that we have to fight night after night.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Worse, we've heard reports of the Asmodians moving to steal and cultivate her young. Imagine - trained Drakan, fighting alongside the cursed Asmodians! We must end this now. We must kill Padmarashka, for now, and all time.</p>
