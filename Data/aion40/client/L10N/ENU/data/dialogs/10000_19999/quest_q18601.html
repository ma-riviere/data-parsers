          <p>Worst nightmare I ever had! I heard voices and screams...but didn't see any faces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I do remember hearing the name "Kromede" shouted a lot. It got me thinking...there's this Asmodian named [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae] at the Fire Temple in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm thinking that there might be some connection...a rift between reality past and present. Would you look into this matter a little more closely? You seem to have the right mind for it.</p>

          <p>I think the best approach would be to investigate this nightmare first, then see what hold it has on reality.</p>

          <p>Take passage to [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF3_SZ_DTW] and find the Daeva of Dream Reading, [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Raninia]. She's the master at interpreting dreams.</p>

          <p>Brigade General Perento said he had suffered from nightmares since handling the Fake Stigma. He said there might be some meaning behind it.</p>

          <p>He said Raninia, a Daeva of Dream Reading, would be able to interpret the nightmare. So you brought the Fake Stigma to her, and she induced a trance to experience it.</p>
