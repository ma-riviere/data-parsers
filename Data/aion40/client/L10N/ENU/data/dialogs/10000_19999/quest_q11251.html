          <p>A Piece of Aegis is amazing, yes? But you need to show care when combining it with a weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Otherwise, the weapon breaks! Ker-plink. Or becomes too powerful for its owner to wield.</p>

          <p>There is only one Daeva who can handle a Piece of Aegis. One Daeva who can work with the blessed materials.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis], master craftsman of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the skills of such a great man don't come cheaply. You'll need at least--at LEAST--8,000,000 Kinah, or else he will be unable to to combine the greatsword and the fragment.</p>

          <p>Once upon a time, Anusis and I were friends in the Artisans Hall. We ate together, created together, even lived together for a while.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But his skill was too far beyond mine. He would get impatient, and I would get sad. This was not good, which was why I traveled so far away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You, though. Don't let his impatience bother you. He is the best of the best. You couldn't ask for a better craftsman to work your greatsword.</p>
