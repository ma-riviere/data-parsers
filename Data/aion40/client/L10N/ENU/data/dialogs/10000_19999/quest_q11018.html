		<p>Forgive me for saying it, but you look like you've fought some pretty precarious battles in Inggison to get that 1200 Mithril coins in your hand.</p>

		<p>You could use a nice new armor-plated jacket, how about that? Because offense is one thing...but defense is truly the most important issue on the battlefield.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Just a mere 1200 Mithril coins and this jacket could be yours! Come on...going once, going twice....</p>

		<p>This equipment is both functional and beautiful at the same time. It will feel as natural as your own skin...the skin of a true warrior.</p>
