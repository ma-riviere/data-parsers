          <p>You'll need three things to achieve it: Kromede's Tear, the Dagger of the Judge, and a very talented blacksmith.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You already have the first thing and, with me, you have the third thing. Now you just need the dagger. If you can get it, I'll take care of the rest.</p>
