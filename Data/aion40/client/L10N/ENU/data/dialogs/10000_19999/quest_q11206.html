          <p>The Asmodians still pour through Silentera Canyon like blood through an open vein. We can hold them...but for how long?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We must advance to Gelkmaros and launch a preemptive attack before more Asmodians come. All the while, the Balaur are just looking for an opportunity to strike.</p>

          <p>The Angrief Wastes vicinity is contaminated by Tiamat's wicked power. Much of its strength is still unknown to us...but what we do know is that it can erode the land and everything on it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we have some intelligence in the matter. The Ksellids near there are barely affected by Tiamat's acidic power.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If we can figure out why this is, we can apply it to our armor and become impervious to the acid. Will you help me find the reason, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Then go to the Angrief Wastes and collect some Steelscale Ksellid carapaces for our research team to experiment with.</p>

          <p>It may take some time to learn the secrets of Tiamat's true strength, but time is on our side for now.</p>

          <p>Please, leave for Angrief Wastes now and bring back about 20 Steelscale Ksellid and Kselliki carapaces.</p>
