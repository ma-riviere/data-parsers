          <p>Only one Daeva can handle a Piece of Aegis. Only one great craftsman can work with the damned unpredictable material.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, I speak of [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Anusis], master craftsman of Sanctum.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>His rates start at 8,000,000 Kinah and are worth every coin. You should go now, yes? Remember me.</p>

          <p>We were friends once, you know, in Artisans Hall. We ate together, crafted together, played together. For a while, we lived together too. Ah, those were sun-sparkling days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But he would get impatient, and I would get sad. It was not good, was not healthy. That's why I came out here to live. I needed to get away.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But don't let his impatience bother you. No, no, YOU are a paying customer, and you couldn't ask for a better craftsman. Anusis is the best of the best.</p>

          <p>Sorry, paying customer. Yes, I can combine Laestrygos's Bow and a Piece of Aegis for you, but it requires detailed work and will cost you 8 million Kinah. That's a firm number, and I've already brought the price down since you're a friend and all. Well, Laestry's friend.</p>
