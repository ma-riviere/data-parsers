          <p>Looking out over the Eye, smelling the smoke and blood we leave in our trail, I get this feeling all through my bones that we Elyos are meant to be here. Meant to win this fight.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, that doesn't mean things will go easy for us. The [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Tdown_DrakanWeapon_60_An]s are a particular problem. Not only do they cause us heavy damages, but every time they go off they give away our position.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need them out of the way. Take the cannons out, [%username].</p>

          <p>Marmara griped about the Balaur Magic Cannons giving away Elyos positions in Tiamaranta's Eye, not to mention the damage done by the cannons themselves.</p>
