          <p>Khapseb! Oton in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_01] ordered his usual Special Lunch Box, but I completely forgot!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And it's past lunch time! He's probably very hungry--he gets cranky when he's hungry. I'm sorry to bother you, but could you deliver this [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11507A] to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Ottone]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Orders are backed up, so I can't deliver it myself. You know it doesn't taste good when it gets cold. Please, take it quick.</p>
