          <p>Hamerun keeps a locked box in Haramel Tower, nyerk. At the very top. Secret documents inside. Maybe proof that Hamerun is big boss.</p>

          <p>Moofrenerk unsure of what is actually inside, but thinks it is documents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The box is very rusty. If anyone ever tried to touch it, even clean it, they were beaten badly, nyerk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Secret document might be a list of big boss names. Moofrenerk and brother get another special handshake deal if information tasty?</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_04_RatmanMWa_Key_18_an] holds the key to the box, nyerk. But remember...box is very rusty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva should kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDNovice_04_RatmanMWa_Num_18_an]s and find oil. Three lubricants should be enough to grease up the keyhole in box.</p>

          <p>Use the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Elevator_Lever] to get up the tower, nyerk. Use the key and oil on Severely Rusted Box, and it should open up like Dukaki Odium abuser needing a taste, nyerk.</p>
