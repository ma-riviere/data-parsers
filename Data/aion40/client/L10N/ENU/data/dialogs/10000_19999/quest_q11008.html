          <p>Soon enough, I expect we'll be ordered into Hanarkand. So the troops need to be ready at a moment's notice!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How would you keep Daevas working at peak efficiency? Feed them, clothe them, yes. What else?</p>

          <p>Perhaps.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My next choice, though, is to keep morale up among the Legionaries, especially those who are already doing well. They should be recognized for their efforts and encouraged to keep up the good work, which also positively affects their shield mates.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, I've written this letter of appreciation to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Rollia]. Would you like to deliver the happy news?</p>

          <p>The fastest ways are to glide in by Air Line or walk through Wildheart Grove.</p>
