          <p>I'm glad you're here, [%username]. I've been hoping help would come for some time now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We're facing an uphill battle against all the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Millipede_58_An]s around here. We can't very well spy on the Balaur when I can't see them, can I? And I can't exactly run out there and start hacking them apart. People would start asking questions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You though, you can! Nothing odd about an Elyos [%userclass] attacking the wriggots, is there? Could you help?</p>
