          <p>Well, slap me upside the head! You've actually made items I'd put in an Asmodian's prison cell!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you're not quite the gloom-cursed WEAKLING I thought you were. You actually qualify to be an Expert in Construction!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This here's a recommendation letter for Fasimedes. He'll give you some fancy-schmancy ceremony, then the title of Construction Expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What are you waiting for?! I don't do this for everyone that strolls on by! Move it, move it, MOVE IT!</p>

          <p>The arts are often pushed aside in times of war. This war is no exception.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet arts such as construction reflect the skill and patience we as Daevas need in order to win this war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, what good is victory if the culture we fight to defend is barren and empty? I pray to Ariel I see more fine artisans soon.</p>

          <p>Undin sent a recommendation letter?! I don't believe it. I never thought that picky slave driver would ever find anyone good enough!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet his passion is what drives him to make such fine creations. I'm glad he finally found someone who felt the same.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hereby decree that [%username] has achieved the rank of Construction Expert! Congratulations!</p>
