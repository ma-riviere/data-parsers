          <p>Pardon me, Daeva. Pardon...but is your name [%username]? I don't believe we've met yet. I'm Estenor, with the Siel's Spear Legion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You probably haven't heard much about my legion, but we were originally led by Lady Siel herself...a long, long time ago.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only a few of us are left in Atreia now...spread between friend and foe...Elysea and Asmodae.</p>

          <p>I've been having these dreams, [%username]. They involve Divine Hisen...but I haven't seen or heard from him since the Cataclysm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He appears in my dreams now...and he simply weeps. He says nothing, he just stares at me and weeps. He was a very strong man when I knew him. Something must be wrong...and I think it has something to do with these Fake Stigmas.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have met others who have dreamed of him as well, and I asked them to have mercy on his soul by killing him...but no one will. Will you, [%username]? Will you free his soul to the Aether? I...cannot.</p>

          <p>May Lady Siel bless you for your kindness, Daeva. Divine Hisen was a very holy man...believed in the good of all creatures.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Knowing him, he'll be in the Temple Vault...even in death. His life's mission was to keep the evil relics sealed in there. He knew they were too dangerous to keep unguarded.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, [%username], go to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDCromede_Seal_Room] and kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDCromede_01_Named_Hierarch_38_An]. Please do it as painlessly and decently as you can. He was a good, kind Daeva.</p>
