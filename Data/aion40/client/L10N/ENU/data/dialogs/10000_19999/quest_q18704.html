          <p>Ah, finally! I hear the clarion call of battle! Sanctum is working with Kamar to raise a force to sweep out Raksang once and for all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I get to be a part of it! Ooh, I can smell the blood and hear the clashing blades already!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But they're insisting we can't move in until some of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDRaksah_2F_DrakanFighterCBone_56_Ae] are dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I won't stand for any more delay! [%username]! Go into Raksang and kill some so the major offensive can begin already!</p>

          <p>Arrgh! Why do we have to do pre-fighting before we can fight? Why not just massacre everything all at once?!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And why didn't they ask ME to do this? "A little reckless," indeed! Well, they can kiss my beautiful round...</p>

          <p>[%username]! You're back, finally! Tell me you cleared out some of the Synthral Balaur!</p>

          <p>Excellent! How I wish I could've joined you in the battle! But soon, very soon, I'll be participating in my own....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, who knows if this'll satisfy Sanctum. All they care about is the success of the mission. How selfish!</p>

          <p>Lagia was excited at the prospect of fighting in Raksang, but Sanctum refuses to start the operation until the  Synthral Balaur are dealt with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though disturbed by her... enthusiasm, you helped out by killing Balaur. Lagia was grateful, but still impatient.</p>
