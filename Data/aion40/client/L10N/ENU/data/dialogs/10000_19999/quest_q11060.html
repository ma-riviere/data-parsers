          <p>Yes, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_DF4_Dramata_57_Al_LF4] has begun to spawn in Gelkmaros. During the egg laying process, she becomes weak. All of her strength goes to reproducing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now is the perfect time to attack her! But the Balaur have taken precautions...they're all over the Forest of Antiquity, protecting Padmarashka's Hideout.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's where you need to go. I'll put together a small strike force to help you, but I wouldn't wait around for them. Now is the time to attack!</p>

          <p>But you did so well that Lord Kaisinel will probably continue to give you orders. Better keep that orb close by.</p>
