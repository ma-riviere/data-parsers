          <p>Anyhow, now that we hold the fortress, they'll be sure to attack us again if only to reclaim their Mixer.</p>

          <p>When taking a look at the fortress, Temenos found an Asmodian device that solves the Aether problem for your enemies. He believes that such an important device will incite the Asmodians to recapture the fortress.</p>

          <p>Hence, a defense shield needs to be established soon. You got rid of the Serrators interfering with the shield, and Temenos rewarded you.</p>
