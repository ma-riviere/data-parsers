          <p>I heard of your work at the Heart of Gravity, Elyos. It wasn't much of a plan in the first place, so it's probably not your fault things went scaly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't know enough about the Hearts yet, but we're getting closer. In fact, new information from the Aetheric Monitor seems to indicate that the Incarnations not only receive power from Tiamat, but feed power back to the Dragon Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The monitor is a useful little device, but even that has problems.</p>

          <p>The power fluctuates between the four Hearts over a short period of time, like Garnon said. But when the power surges the highest at the Heart of Fissure, it shorts out the Monitor and we get unreliable results.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon thinks it might be caused by an incompatible power source. We need something that runs on the same part of the aetheric spectrum as the field around the Hearts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cindercone Outpost sent us a vague report about some strange creature near the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4b_SZ_T3_A6] that they suspect has unique magical properties. Go see if there's anything we can use.</p>

          <p>Interesting... Already I can tell it has the same kind of resonance as the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, this should keep the Magical Power Field from shorting out. Thank you, [%username]--you've done well, as always.</p>

          <p>The Aetheric Monitor keeps shorting out due to an incompatible power source. Adella sent you to the Fields of Fire to look for a replacement power source.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you killed the Fragmented Pyreogre at the Wrath Vent, it transformed into a Pyroclast containing a Hot Wrath Fragment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Garnon said the Hot Wrath Fragment should solve the problems with the Aetheric Monitor.</p>
