          <p>Help! Help! I've made a huge mistake! It's the Fungies, [%username]. THE FUNGIES.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most of them are poisonous, you see, but the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_Fungy_Flower_56_n]s--they aren't! They're full of nutrients and quite, quite tasty. So we planted their spores throughout the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_A1], hoping to establish a sustainable source of food.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When we came back, they were everywhere. They're multiplying faster than we can assess their numbers, and if nothing is done, we'll soon be drowning under a sea of Fungies! Please, please help us, [%username]! Kill them for us, before it's too late!</p>

          <p>Shuos, a Reian in the Refugee Camp, was terrified about the rapid spread of the Seedleaf Fungies, creatures that the Reians had originally set aside for consumption. They had since reproduced too quickly, and needed wiping out somewhat. You helped out, much to Shuos' rather overblown relief.</p>
