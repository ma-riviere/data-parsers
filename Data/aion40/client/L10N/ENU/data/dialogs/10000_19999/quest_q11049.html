          <p>In a lot of ways, Reshanta was way better than Balaurea. Yeah, I was in Reshanta before I came here. I'd volunteered because I wanted to find out about Stigma, see?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But that's how I learned that no one really knows anything for sure about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some say the souls of vanished Daevas combine with Aether to become crystals. But that's Porgus puke! Sure, it can happen, but we can prove that it'll only happen in very unstable environments. So how do we have so many Stigma?</p>

          <p>The first Stigma was found there, probably created when the Abyss showed up and made the Aetheric flow unstable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm going to try and make this description uncomplicated. So, apologies in advance if I fail utterly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unstable Aether always leads to Stigma, but the presence of Stigma doesn't always mean unstable Aether, right? So I'm hoping to learn somethin' from Taloc. The Aether inside him is way more unstable than in the Abyss.</p>

          <p>I can't really tell yet. I think I'm getting somewhere, but I need more samples of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11049a] to get a better picture.</p>
