          <p>The number of Dragonbound seems to be increasing every day. Sending a few Daevas in to take care of the matter is no longer an option.</p>

          <p>I wish Sanctum would start sending us reinforcements soon.... I don't know how much longer we can hold out.</p>

          <p>To the best of my knowledge, I think those Dragonbound have something to do with all the kidnappings of Reian tribesmen.</p>
