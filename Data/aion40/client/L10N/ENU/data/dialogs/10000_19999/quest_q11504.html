        <body>
          <p>You know what they say: never work with animals, and never work with children. So what do I do? I come here, study the wildlife, and work alongside Shuos, thereby choosing both. I am drunk on my own stupidity, [%username].</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been breeding certain plant species, hoping to encourage certain traits to emerge as features. It's been going well, or rather HAD been going well. Then the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_A1_Brax_DR_56_n]es rolled in, and started munching their way through my research.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I want enough of them killed so that the others scatter. Can you help, [%username]?</p>

          <p>Ha! Maybe I should have bred my plants to that they would develop poisonous leaves, or thorns! I must look into that....</p>

          <p>How did you do?</p>

          <p>Excellent! Thank you!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't feel sorry for them, [%username]. Braxes are remarkably resilient creatures, and will bounce back soon enough. Hopefully somewhere that isn't here.</p>

          <p>Ristiel, a Reian researcher, turned to you for help after seeing her work slowly being destroyed by migrating Braxes. You killed enough of them to force the others to scatter, thereby saving her work and earning her reward.</p>
