          <p>Now that we have successfully driven the Balaur back to Angrief with the aid of Empyrean Lord Kaisinel, shouldn't we take all of Tiamaranta?</p>

          <p>Angrief may be too dangerous for you yet, but there's [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_A2_DranaFarm] south of [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF4_SZ_OP]. When we built our fortress there we killed plenty of Balaur, but I think some remained and damaged the Obelisks nearby.</p>

          <p>You'll repair the broken Obelisks with this Aether Wave Stone, brought by Sorcerers from Sanctum.

          <p>Since then, the Wisplight Legion has maintained the illusion of the Inggison Illusion Fortress, disturbed our enemies with chaos magic, and spread Aether wherever necessary.</p>
