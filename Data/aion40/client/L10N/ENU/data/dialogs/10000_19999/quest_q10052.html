          <p>I hear our Elders whispering of Lord Israphel and Siel's Relics. I hear them whisper your name as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The investigation of Siel's Relics is already under way. But for now, I have a job I feel I should trust to you. My latest report from the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1_01] indicates that there have been strange movements amongst the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go there and speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nyitia]. She will give you more details.</p>

          <p>Ah, our Elyos friend! I've heard intriguing things of you. What do you think of this fractured, nightmarish part of our world? Charming landscape, isn't it? No, I don't like it either.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here's the situation. The Balaur are acting strangely, suddenly changing their patrols and deploying what seem like search parties in the upper parts of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_C1].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think they're looking for something. Go see what you can find out from the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4A_C1_DrakanRa_noble_58_An]s.</p>

          <p>I feared as much. We have less time than I thought. I know what they're looking for, and they're only a few steps behind us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a legend in Sarpan about a Zayedan who gained extraordinary powers while following a vision deep into Tiamaranta. Thing is, this Zayedan, Oriata... people call her the Protector... she is no legend. A few Reians know that she exists, sleeping deep within a realm of her own creation. Even fewer know that her vision was of Siel's Relics, and that she has learned how to counter their power.</p> 
          <p> </p>
          <p>We suspect Oriata was in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B2_09] at some point. She may have left a clue to her current whereabouts there. If you're ready, I can <font color="B00000">teleport</font> you there.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Israphel--if that's who he really is--is wise not to trust the Asmodians. But he has never shown any partiality before. Why aid the Elyos now?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's a rhetorical question, [%username]. I don't expect you to know the answer.</p>

          <p>Garnon sent you to find out why the Balaur had been acting so strangely lately. You discovered that they were on the trail of Oriata, a powerful Protector capable of countering Siel's Relics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You hurried to the Jotari Sanctuary Ruins, where Oriata was last seen, and while searching for Oriata's trail, were attacked by an overwhelming Asmodian force. Empyrean Lord Israphel saved you from them at the last moment.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Israphel warned you not to share what you'd found with Garnon, to protect the information from the Asmodians. You returned to Killios, who agreed with Israphel's suggestion, and sent you to find Oriata yourself.</p>
