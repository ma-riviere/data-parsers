          <p>Here's a fact: we don't know much about the Gurriki, given that they only live here in Tiamaranta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, they're just as likely to be territorial or outright working for the Balaur as any other Sapien.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kahrun's Will weakening in their lands means that Tiamat is probably planning something serious for that region. Whatever it is, it must be stopped.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kill [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuFi_57_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_Gururuwi_57_Ae]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuAs_57_Ae]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_C1_GururuCl_57_Ae]s; fewer hostile Gurriki should mean less chance of any plot working.</p>

          <p>Personally, I'm not sure Tiamat's done us any favors by weakening Kahrun's Will.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reians are right about one thing: having to fight the Asmodians certainly does leave us less able to fight the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully, keeping the hostile Gurriki in check will keep some of the pressure off.</p>

          <p>Good, good. I'll report to Ancanus that our schedule is proceeding on time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The friendly Gurriki have been approaching us, asking for aid in swaying their bretheren. Perhaps your efforts will contribute to that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for showing everyone that allying with the Balaur only brings one reward: death.</p>

          <p>Karuti expressed concern that Tiamat could be signalling interest in the hostile Gurriki of Gurriki Grotto.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus you fought the rogue Gurriki, leaving Tiamat with fewer resources to work with.</p>
