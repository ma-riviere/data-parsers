          <p>Many Reians may be hostile to the Elyos, but not us craftsmen. In fact, many of the techniques we use today are based on Elyos techniques, thought up before the Cataclysm, when the two different cultures started forming, and since our reconnection.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most recently, I've been trying to learn how to incorporate those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11516A]s that Elyos artisans are so adept at using in their designs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The only problem I have is that I cannot source enough, and I am not strong enough to fight the Calydons of the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_calydon_fam] that grow them in their stomachs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could you help, friend? I would pay you well for your time.</p>

          <p>The crystal balls are extremely delicate. I hope you were gentle when you were sending the Calydons to the Aether?</p>

          <p>Solomon, a Reian architect, spoke about his fondness for Elyos craftsmanship, and told you how he had hoped to learn more Elyos techniques, but came unstuck after running out of the crystal balls he needed. He offered you money to resupply his stocks, which you promptly did.</p>
