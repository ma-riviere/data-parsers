          <p>Hey, [%username]! It's good to see you again. Wanna see how the Root Herb treatments are working?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's easy to prepare. I pounded the Root Herb into paste while the Fess textile was soaking in disinfectant, then I rinsed the textile and smeared it with the paste. Done!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's it. Easy and effective.</p>

          <p>Amazingly well. Do you want to give me a hand applying this next set of bandages?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd love you to see how well it works. It's fascinating!</p>

          <p>And it was only possible because you were willing to trace that old legend!</p>

          <p>Great! Take this pile of bandages and go treat those soldiers over there. All three of them were wounded by the dredgion's cursed weapons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Their wounds aren't getting better with standard treatments, so it's time to try the Root Herb.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Be gentle. Try not to hurt them more than necessary while you're wrapping their wounds.</p>
