          <p>The Reian Tribe can't remain between us and the Asmodians forever. Surely Kahrun will see our righteousness sooner or later.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to be prepared when that time comes. We'll need to show Kahrun that the Elyos are a powerful, staunch ally worthy of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go to a [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q41189_publicall]. Wait until the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Dredgion] appears, and kill an [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11525a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That way we both repel a threat to this region and prove to anyone with eyes that the Elyos are the greatest force in Atreia.</p>

          <p>I have had Scouts tracking the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_LDF4a_Dredgion], but it's difficult, for obvious reasons.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thus the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q11525a]s are also hard to track. But I have every confidence you can do it.</p>

          <p>Ah, I knew you'd come through for your people. Once Kahrun hears of this, how can he not grant us his grace over the Asmodians?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I only hope that I am present to see the looks on the trogs' faces when Kahrun lets loose his leash. It will be glorious!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Until then, we must do what we can. This reward is a pale reflection of your deeds, but it's all I can spare at the moment.</p>

          <p>Hushblade Legion Centurion Crispin wanted you to prove Elyos superiority to Kahrun for the time when he inevitably chose a side between you and the Asmodians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To do so, you went to a Dredgion Infiltration Zone and killed a Zorshiv Dredgion commander. You returned to a great reward.</p>
