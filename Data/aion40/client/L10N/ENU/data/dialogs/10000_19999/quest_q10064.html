          <p>Finally. We're finally ready.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can hardly believe that the day has come. It feels... unreal. But we have fought so hard for it, and for such a long time. [%username], we deserve a life free of Balaur tyranny! We all do.</p>

          <p>This first foray won't be an all-out assault. It's a scouting mission. We know too little about the Eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Each faction is sending an elite force of troops into Tiamaranta's Eye. The Elyos company just left, but you can still catch up with them. The Asmodian and Reian companies are on their way. I'll be joining them shortly.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Are you prepared, [%username]? I will send you when you're ready.</p>

          <p>The plan is to move north along the Eye's walls, tracking the movements of any patrols while we get the layout of the Eye.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Primary objective is to locate the Dragon Lord. Keep your eyes peeled and your weapons at the ready.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>No... there is still a chance... if we simply never speak of this again. We will blame the Balaur, and I will hold my lying tongue. I know better now than to trust an Elyos, and I know better than to trust you.</p>

          <p>War breaks one's heart with its unpredictable ferocity. Their legions must be even stronger than we thought.</p>

          <p>We'll need to withdraw, regroup, and prepare a larger force. This will take longer than I had hoped.</p>

          <p>Ah... Before you go, [%username], I want to give you something. This weapon is made to exacting standards. It is deadly, and in your capable hands it will spell slaughter for the Balaur. The Reian people appreciate your service, [%username]. You're dismissed.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The Asmodian Legion appeared, and you discovered that the temporary peace had not healed old wounds. You battled the Asmodians, and slaughtered them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When Garnon and the Reian company arrived, she barely had time to register her shock before both Elyos and Reians were forced to beat a hasty retreat in the face of a sudden Balaur assault.</p>

          <p>You reported back to Adella, who realized that the assault on Tiamaranta's Eye would take longer than planned.</p>
