          <p>Good news on our Israphel hunt!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My scouts report that there have been some strange phenomena sighted in the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LDF4a_SZ_B1]. If I'm right, they must be related to our mystery energy signatures. Go and check out these [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4a_Monster_M_Aurora_58_An]es and see if you can't extract their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_10072a] for us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The sorcerers say they can use that to track Israphel. I don't pretend to understand it, but they seem to know what they're talking about. Hah, and if the Reians ask, you can honestly say you don't know anything about the Rift Energy, right?</p>

          <p>Excellent! We know from Garnon that the Magical Energy Signature you found before was some kind of key. Now my sorcerers are saying that we can combine these two different types of energy to recreate the gate that Israphel used.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The best part of it is, the Reians are still running around trying to figure it out! We should be able to get there before them.</p>

          <p>They told me how to activate the gate, so I can send you there... wherever "there" is. I assume it's some kind of extradimensional hideout of Israphel's.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once you're there, it'll be your job to get those relics back. Try talking to Israphel; he may have made some bad decisions, but he's still an Empyrean Lord. You two have history, so maybe he'll listen to you.</p>

          <p>I'm sure you've heard the history of how the Dragon Lords rose up against their creator, [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA02], and tried to become gods themselves. That's why Aion created the twelve Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We created the Aetheric Field to defend the tower, but it just prolonged the tedious stalemate. The Humans and Daevas began to laugh at us and turn away from our teachings, since the twelve of us together couldn't defeat our five enemies.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was sick of my comrades' inaction. I'd suggested many plans, but they rejected each one, afraid of war and pain and loss. I knew that those things would only get worse if we didn't do something decisive. Besides, I knew how to absorb the power from the Tower of Eternity and use it.</p>

          <p>I'm disappointed; I didn't think you had such a small mind. I needed that power to put down the Dragon Lords for good. All we needed to do was to lure them near the tower.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I told the other Empyreans that we were holding a peace conference. Then, I went to [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA51] and convinced it that it could take this opportunity to crush the Empyrean Lords.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA49] had plans of its own, and destroyed the Tower of Eternity. As the Cataclysm happened all around us, I let the others think I was helping Siel to maintain the Aetheric Field, but I knew there was no point in sacrificing myself as well.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You might call me a coward, but I am a pragmatist. I had another plan--one which it has taken me this long to orchestrate.</p>

          <p>What if you could restore [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA03] to its original glory? What if you could bring [%dic:STR_DIC_ELA02] back? Well, with my control of space and these relics' power over time, I can do that. I can take us back to the beginning, when everything was perfect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, the new Atreia will need a leader. We've seen where so many voices would lead us, and it's clear that one voice must ring out clearer and louder than the others. We only need one Empyrean Lord.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is my chance to redeem myself! I will lead Atreia into a golden age, and steer everyone onto the right path.</p>
