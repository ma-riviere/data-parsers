          <p>Greetings, Daeva. I'll report my findings to you....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Reian tribe is not in any real danger of being attacked now...but they are in danger of being kidnapped and turned into Dragonbound--a fate almost as bad.</p>

          <p>The Dragonbound and their underlings lurk beneath us. I have spoken with several Daevas who have fallen through this brittle ground, and they have seen what lies below.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Direbeast_Fanatic_53_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B_Fethlot_Highland_53_n]es fill the shadows beneath our feet, and they pour out near the fissure, like the opening of a bottle of ale.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We don't know why they are so hostile, but we must destroy as many of them as we can! Can the Sanctum Expeditionary Force contract you to do this for us?</p>
