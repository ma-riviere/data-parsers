          <p>[%username]! Let's talk about my baby Klaws. Please?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Klaw eggs you brought me were extra-healthy, and the baby Klaws are super-cute now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But five have hatched already, and my comrades at the outpost have said they'll...get rid of any new ones.</p>

          <p>Remember, they're tame, but still aggressive by nature. So you need to make eye contact with them several times a day and pat them on the head. That way they know you're in charge.</p>
