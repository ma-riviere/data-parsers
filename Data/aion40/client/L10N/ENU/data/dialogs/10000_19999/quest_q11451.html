          <p>You're [%username], yes? I've heard much about you. You are the Daeva who can pass in and out of Taloc without getting ill.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I must ask a favor of you. My comrade Donbran stayed too long inside Taloc. He didn't listen to my advice. Something happened to him in there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's sick now, and he's not getting any better. Please, you must help me...you must help him.</p>

          <p>We need a cure. It's not just Donbran...several Daevas came out of Taloc the same way. I have no treatment for their illness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I heard alchemist [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phailos] is developing some kind of antidote. I'm not sure how far he's gotten to finishing it, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm in real trouble here, [%username]. My legion is dropping like flies, and my Brigade General is squeezing me for information.</p>

          <p>See Phailos! Everyone around here is on pins and needles waiting for him to finish the antidote, but he's taking his own sweet time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you check up on [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phailos] for me?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm sure once he sees a big strong [%userclass] standing over him, he'll hurry it up a bit.</p>

          <p>That blasted [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Phailos] is just lounging about, taking his time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He says that since Daevas can't really die, there's no need for him to stop his other studies to make the cure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But we feel pain. Donbran feels pain. My legion feels pain. You can get him to move a little faster then?</p>
