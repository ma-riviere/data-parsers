          <p>It's amazing, [%username], but with as much combat as we've had with the Dragonbound, we still know very little about them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those dangerous dwellers of Undirborg... We don't know how strong they are, the best way to kill them, what slows them down...nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're unlike our other foes.</p>

          <p>We must learn all we can about these Dragonbound so we can properly fight them...as well as properly defend ourselves against them. They're very unlike the Reians they once were.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>[%username], this may be something of a suicide mission, but we need to understand their fighting skills. I need the best of the best...I need you out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For the sake of all Elyos, will you take on [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B5_FanaticFi_53_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B5_FanaticAs_53_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_B5_FanaticCh_53_An]s to find out what best kills them?</p>

          <p>Strange. I've heard from several Daevas that you were one of the toughest they knew...yet you decline a mission only you are capable of handling.</p>
