          <p>For the life of me, I can't seem to find any real difference between the life of a Daeva and the life of a Human...aside from our time-spans in life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We face the same turmoils, the same hardships, the same enemies....</p>

          <p>Yes, living forever is quite a difference. But to truly live life, you can't think about such a thing as death...so we are more like Humans than you think.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strangely enough, this reminds me of a very dear friend of mine, Paris. I haven't heard from him in ages.... I understand he's been missing for a long time now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He was known for his strength and courage, so he's sorely missed. These unusual pauldrons here--they're the only things he left behind.</p>

          <p>He was a good Daeva. And his pauldrons are very special...very dear to me. They're the only ones of their kind. I want to honor him, and I wasn't sure how to go about it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then it dawned on me! I will find a worthy Daeva, someone who shares the same beliefs as Paris, and I will give these pauldrons to him. But they must prove themself first.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva who can wipe out the Dragonbound--that is the Daeva who deserves the pauldrons. Are you up to it, [%username]? You remind me of Paris in his younger days.</p>

          <p>And lastly, Daeva, I want to construct a worthy monument to Paris. I would like you to contribute 50,000 Kinah, if you would. The pauldrons are priceless, so the Kinah shouldn't worry you much.</p>
