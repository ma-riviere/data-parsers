          <p>You wouldn't believe it. My buddy Stanis was telling me about a Daeva who found one of our old Secret Orders and actually completed it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Some kid who probably still uses phrases like "shinyrific," I bet.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Brought back memories of when I was young and foolish, always worrying about the missions and never about myself. We had to write those Secret Orders because Sanctum thought the stuff we did was too dangerous.</p>

          <p>Aaaaah. You got me.</p>

          <p>No...really? That's just.... Shards! You must be some Daeva, kid.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But there's a little snag, see. When Stanis and I promised that reward--Utsida's Noble Ring--well, it didn't cost as much. Nowadays, the commission fee alone is 20,000,000 Kinah. If you really want it, I'll need you to float me a loan!</p>

          <p>Just make sure to keep track of yourself. You want to look in the mirror and still be alive to hate your gray hairs someday, yes?</p>

          <p>Heh. I wouldn't have done it either! What kind of crazy Daeva is this Temenos, trying to take my money after I followed his blasted Secret Order?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just saying, I know how you feel. If you decide that you want the magnificent reward and that it's worth the cost, you come back to me with that 20,000,000 Kinah, all right?</p>
