          <p>Pardon my interest, [%username], but what sort of plans did you have for that Kromede's Flame of yours?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you melt it down, you know, you can compound it with the Sword of the Judge to make one very strong weapon.</p>

          <p>You'll need three things, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first is Kromede's Flame, which you already have. The second is a skilled and accomplished blacksmith...and that would be me, the legendary Ukon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And third, you'll need the Sword of the Judge for me to refine.</p>

          <p>Consider yourself blessed by Ariel, [%username]. I normally wouldn't bother with an unpaid project like this...but I'm making amends for some past actions.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Absolution has its price, you know. And since you're the first Daeva-in-need I've come across, the honor of my help is all yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Start at the Fire Temple in Asmodae. You'll find the Sword of the Judge there with [%dic:STR_DIC_M_FireSanctuaryQueenBoss_37_Ae]. Get that, and I'll do the rest.</p>

          <p>Just hand me the Sword of the Judge and Kromede's Flame, and I'll show you why I am considered a legend. Remember: both need to be in your Cube!</p>
