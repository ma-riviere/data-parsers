          <p>They say we were all one people once: Reian, Elyos, and even Asmodian.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In a way, we still are. Despite our differences, we all have a single purpose in common: defeating the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As such, I hope it's not impudent to request your time and strength.</p>

          <p>You have my gratitude, Elyos. I could feel the Balaur's twisting the Holy Tree towards evil.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He is now known as [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDF4Re_Dra_01_BionicCPU_53_Ah], and his corrupted roots bind the other Elim.</p>
