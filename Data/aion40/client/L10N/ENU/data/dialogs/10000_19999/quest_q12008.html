          <p>We have several reasons for being here, [%username], and only one of them is so that we can help the Reians.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'd be fools not to further the Elyos cause while we're here. Our high command, recognizing that fact, have set up numerous undercover missions for the Hushblade Legion to complete. The only problem is the local wildlife getting in their way.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Foam_Red_58_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LDF4b_T2_Foam_White_58_An]s need to be destroyed as soon as possible. If they're not, the Hushblade Legionnaires will have to fight them themselves, and risk being found and questioned by the Reians. We can't have that now, can we?.</p>
