          <p>Yes, yes. Meininerk has very rare, very special medicines. Purchased while traveling outer reaches of dangerous, exotic Asmodae, Elysea and Abyss!</p>

          <p>[%dic:STR_DIC_N_Cinisca] speak most unkind words about Meininerk. I am Shugo, I bargain best price for my special wares. Who is she to call Meininerk scruffy? Is not Shugo's fault that Human can not negotiate way out of supply sack. Nyerk, nyerk!</p>
