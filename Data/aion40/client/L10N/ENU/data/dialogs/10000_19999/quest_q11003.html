          <p>We usually get plenty of materials to create Illusion Spheres from Sanctum, but shipments have been slow lately. Harknes says there're similar materials in Calmheart and Wildheart Groves, though.</p>

          <p>Would you go find some, [%username]? It would save us a lot of time if that's true.</p>

          <p>What we need are [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11003a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_11003b]. You'll get those from [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Foam_Wisp_51_n]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF4_A_Shadowstalker_Leaf_51_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When you find them, you should take the materials straight to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Strabon]. He'll be able to determine if they're really the same as the materials from Sanctum.</p>

          <p>Phailos uses Illusion Spheres to maintain the Illusion Fortress's illusion, but he can't get materials from Sanctum fast enough. He said that Harknes thought there might be substitute materials in Calmheart and Wildheart Groves.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You brought Seafoam Energy and Excura Energy to Harknes on behalf of busy Phailos. Harknes said he'd check if the materials could be safely substituted.</p>
