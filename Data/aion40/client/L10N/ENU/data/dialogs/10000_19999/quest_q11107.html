          <p>Finally! I've nearly finished my deliveries...all but these three Comfort Packages.</p>
          <p> </p>          
          <p>You know, [%username], I am growing very sick of this job. I want to be out there with you Daevas fighting for Elysea, defending its borders, putting my wings on the line for justice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm stuck here, with three Comfort Packages that are too heavy for me to deliver.</p>

          <p>Faith and arms, [%username]! That would be great!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I need to get these packages to the Gate Guards...one per gate. You know, I've always dreamed of being a soldier and receiving one of these Comfort Packages.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I've been stuck here delivering mail for so long that I can't even manage to lift one of these packages now. I'll never be a soldier.</p>

          <p>A Comfort Package? It's been so long since I've gotten one--I thought maybe they stopped delivering them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The last one I got...hmmm...sometime after our first victory in Reshanta. I got six pairs of underwear, tobacco, and honey.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hopefully this batch will be something a little more useful. Thank you, Daeva.</p>
