		<p>There's something special about studying ancient relics, don't you think? It's a true glimpse into our past, [%username].</p>
		<p> </p>
    <p>Items carefully crafted hundreds, perhaps thousands of years ago by artisans who've long since departed for the Aether. Our Elyos ancestors still give us so much, even now.</p>
    <p> </p>
		<p>Ah, I'm rambling. What brings you to me, friend?</p>

	<p>Ah, Lesser Ancient Icons!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Well, all icons have worth, although these are the most damaged, and therefore the least valuable to us. That's not to say there's no reward for bringing them to me. Take the Abyss Points, and use them well, my child.</p>

	<p>Hmm... yes, these will do.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>These Ancient Icons are certainly worth something. However, had they been slightly better preserved, or had the designs been created by a slightly better artisan, then I'd be able to award you with more Abyss Points. Perhaps next time!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you, [%username]. You've done very well.</p>

	<p>Let me have a look here...</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Oh my! The craftsmanship here is remarkable! These are certainly of a greater standard, which means that you, dear [%username], get a substantial reward.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you! If you find any more of these, then please do let me know.</p>

	<p>These... these are incredible!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>[%username], adventurers try to hand me Major Ancient Icons almost every single day. Of course, most are cheap imitations or simply not up to the quality we expect. But these! I cannot find a single flaw!</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Thank you so much for bringing me such precious research materials. I have awarded you the maximum number of Abyss Points. Use them well, friend!</p>

	<p>Ancient Icons are vital to understanding our past, [%username]. The leaders of Sanctum recognizes that, and have authorized me to reward Daevas who bring these treasures to us.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>That includes you, friend. You'll be rewarded with Abyss Points for your work.</p>

	<p>Ah.... no, you don't.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Check your cube again, [%username]. You may have confused it with other items. Remember, Ancient Icons are classified into Major, Greater, Standard, and Lesser qualities.</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p>Also, you can't request a reward for handing in 10 Greater Icons when you just have 2 Lesser Icons and 8 Greater Icons. Trust me, many people try that little trick.</p>
