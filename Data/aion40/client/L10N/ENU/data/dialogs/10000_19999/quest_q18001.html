          <p>The secret space at the fortress is where the Rune Tribe keeps their research books on Idgel and Idgels.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We needed Idgel to activate the weapon. It's really great.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a problem, though. Some of the Beritras are still there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So could you go collect the Idgel pieces from the test subjects and the remaining Beritra, dear [%username]?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If multiple people go in, they'll notice you. So please go in by yourself.</p>

          <p>You all right?</p>

          <p>As soon as you went in, the alarm went crazy. Were you discovered, [%username]?</p>

          <p>How would I know that they had an alarm set? The Beritra are better than I thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, you did a great job.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thanks to you, we've got so much Idgel.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please continue to help in the future.</p>
