          <p>The Manastone Removers Association is changing the face of business, [%username]. It seems our manastone collection project was a smashing success, so much so that we could barely keep up with all the new business!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've been getting orders left and right.... Just got a big one for HP +70, Accuracy +22, and Block +22 manastones. I can streamline this business transaction by taking bundles of 10 each, if you have them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bulk orders offer better rewards. Care to exchange some manastones? How many do you have on you? Know where to get some? Seriously, let's do business here.</p>

          <p>Great, great! You'd be a fool not to take me up on this offer. Daevas are always expecting a swindle, you know? But this is good for the both of us...what the Shugos call a win-win deal.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wouldn't be surprised if you had some HP +70, Accuracy +22, or Block +22 manastones just gathering dust in your warehouse or cube. Take a look...I'll wait.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Big demand for those styles right now. Have any?</p>

          <p>10 manastones isn't set in stone, Daeva. It's more of a...guideline, really. I'll work with you on this one...for all those less fortunate Daevas out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's more paperwork for me, but I like you, Daeva. Can I interest you on that deal?</p>

          <p>The Manastone Removers Association used to be a for-profit endeavor, but as you can see, we're there for the needy, the paupers, the beggars now. We turn lives around these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We make dreams come true by recycling your old manastones and selling them back to the public...at a much more affordable price. We help Daevas become the best Daevas they can be, on any type of budget.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, how about it? Your manastone contribution will help some unfortunate Daeva get back on his or her own two wings. Ready to exchange some manastones?</p>

          <p>For my special, special deal, I'm only looking for HP +70, Accuracy +22, and Block +22 manastones! The poor and less fortunate out there...only want these particular types of manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You help me get these types, and I'll load you up with some new and improved manastones. Got it?</p>
