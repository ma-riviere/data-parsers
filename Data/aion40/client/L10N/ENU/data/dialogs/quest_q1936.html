          <p>I've had a new report from Nerison at the Research Center Overwatch.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It may not be anything significant, but given what we've already learned, we'd better double-check anything suspicious.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And I want to keep this secret until we know more.</p>

          <p>A few days ago, a big box was moved out of the Lepharist Research Center under cover of darkness.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to Nerison, the crate was big enough to contain a person, and the people carrying it took great care with it. The crate was too heavily guarded for Nerison to get close, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Nerison] and get an update? I'm worried that the mysterious cargo may be related to the Human alteration experiment.</p>

          <p>Xenophon suspected that the box might be related to the Human modification experiments that the Lepharists had been conducting. As he suggested, you went to Heiron and met Nerison.</p>
