          <p>The presence of fire marks you, Daeva. Radiant tongues of flame speak to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, the aura is unmistakable. Tell me, do you hold a weapon infused with the same celestial fires that bless our people?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I would dearly like to see such an item.</p>

          <p>Ah, just as I thought. The sword is a powerful weapon--that much cannot be denied. Such precision of design, yet an unnamed fury within.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet, its promise is still unfulfilled. The essence of fire cries out from within, but it's a hollow echo. The flame waits to be fed and nurtured into its final form.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With the right materials, I would be able to imbue this blade with a far more potent measure of searing flame. These materials, however...you would have to travel far to acquire them.</p>

          <p>I was hoping you'd say that. You must feed a weapon well if you expect it to serve you faithfully.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This sword hungers for three materials: Griffonix Feather, Magma Essence, and Burning Barghest Tail.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All three are found in Eltnen. Are you certain you are up to the task, [%userclass]?</p>

          <p>The materials will not simply fall into your hands the moment you reach Eltnen, unfortunately.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find both [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1930B] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1930C] in the Geroch Caldera. It's an inhospitable place at the best of times.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>To acquire the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1930A], travel deep into the Kuriullu Mountain and find the Griffonix, head of all Griffons. You'll then either have to persuade the Griffonix to help you, or fight it.</p>

          <p>I see that the journey is too much for you at this time. I'm sure Daevas like you have many duties to attend to.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As you go about your duties, though, ponder this: if you're pinned down by a full Legion of marauding Asmodians, will you wish that your sword burned with the fury of a living flame?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you change your mind, return to me, and we'll never speak of this refusal again.</p>

          <p>Magnificent! Give me a moment.... Infusing a sword such as this takes all my concentration.</p>
