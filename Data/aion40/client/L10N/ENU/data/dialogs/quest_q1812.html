          <p>The Centurion is such a great man!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lately he just pores over the campaign maps of Reshanta, worrying over each new Asmodian gain.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He said last night that if we can't reverse the trend, we'll never retake the fortress.</p>

          <p>I've heard of your cunning and power, [%username]. Couldn't you do something to raise the Centurion's hopes?</p>
