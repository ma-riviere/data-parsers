          <p>I have taught many Daevas Handicrafting, but I've never seen anyone reach such a high level as quickly as you have, [%username].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You have a unique talent, but there is a special challenge for those who want to be honored in this field.</p>

          <p>Make Utsida's Noble Necklace and bring it to me. It won't be easy to make. Such a masterpiece will proclaim your ability and secure your right to be honored as an Expert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you agree to become a Handicrafting Expert, you can only become an Expert in one other field, and even then you must wait until you've finished your studies. So think carefully before you answer. But I can't imagine that anyone with your gift would let it go to waste. Will you take my challenge?</p>

          <p>With your talent for Handicrafting and your ambition, I expect it will take you very little time and effort to craft Utsida's Noble Necklace. Though, it is considerably more difficult than [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q1976]. Go to Chiwurinerk who sells the design, and soon enough, you'll create Utsida's Noble Necklace for me.</p>
