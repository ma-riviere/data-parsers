          <p>Listen, Daeva. Do you hear the sound of the wind through the trees?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Once, that sound brought me peace and comfort. Now my hand moves to my sword, unbidden.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Wind Spirits have turned savage. They attack anyone who enters their territory. Pilgrims arrive here seeking serenity, and instead they risk being torn apart!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We do not know the cause. I hear a strange sickness contaminated the Swamp, that docile creatures there became violent. I fear it might have spread!</p>

          <p>Very well. I must call upon the Shugos to deliver it. Their greed is reliable, and they are eager for work.</p>

          <p>Hmm. Observations, but no insights. Not even so much as an educated guess!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>No change in the Aether, and the Daeva sense nothing unusual. Why, then, have the Wind Spirits turned vicious? We need Sanctum's help in this. Let the Sages ponder it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Thank you for your trouble, [%userclass]. You'd have been quite justified in refusing such a menial task! I shall have words with Cerios about how he's to treat Daevas in future.</p>
