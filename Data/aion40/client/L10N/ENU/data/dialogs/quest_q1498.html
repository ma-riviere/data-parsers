          <p>It looks like I have a bit of a crisis on my hands, [%username]. The Kaidan Krall have abducted a geologist named Hierni.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Fortunately she was taken to the Kaidan Mine and not the Kaidan Headquarters, so if we act swiftly we may be able to rescue her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's no knowing what they might do to Hierni. I'm greatly concerned for her safety. </p>

          <p>A small strike force is on the way. They want us to distract the enemy by wiping out the Wallarms and Assaulters guarding the Kaidan Mine.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think you're perfect for the task, [%username]. Will you go and eliminate those Krall in the Kaidan Mine for us?</p>

          <p>You will be rewarded handsomely for your efforts, of course.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Leave right away then. Any delay is a risk to Hierni. Let me fill you in on a few things first, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Kaidan Mine is dangerous, so gather some allies before you go. When you defeat the Kaidan Wallarms and Assaulters, take their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1498a]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1498b]s, and return them to me.</p>
