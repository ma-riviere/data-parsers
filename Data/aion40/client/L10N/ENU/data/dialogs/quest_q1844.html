          <p>I just know I'm to gather as many Daevas as I can, and send them through the stone gate to some Balaur infested chamber. Something about hidden portals, and ah...oh, yeah, treasure.</p>

          <p>The place is loaded with the stuff, apparently. I've seen some guys coming back through the stone gate, their cubes loaded with stuff to sell.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> All you have to do, apparently, is kill all the Balaur you can find there, including their leader. Name is...ah...what was it? Versi? Varsi? Ah! [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Lamiren_DrakanNamed_45_Ah]!</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you! For some reason, not many Daevas were accepting. Captain thinks I'm not persuasive enough, but can't sell something you know nothing about, right?</p>

          <p>Ok, well ah...good luck! Go kick some Balaur butt...or something?</p>
