          <p>I have been suffering from nightmares these days....</p>

          <p>Asmodians surround the fortress, but when I look at them closely, they wear the faces of Balaur. Then, I wake up drenched in sweat.</p>

          <p>Sigh.... I'm not sure. I recently spoke with a historian who had an interesting theory, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There is a place called the Grave of Steel in Siel's Right Wing, so named for the huge weapon embedded within it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The historian I spoke with believes the weapon belonged to the Balaur. He thinks energy is leaking out from the weapon and into the nearby Asmodian ghosts.</p>

          <p>No. Who knows what that energy could transform the ghosts into.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Someone really should go and check on the undead there, but all the other Daevas are busy with missions right now.</p>
