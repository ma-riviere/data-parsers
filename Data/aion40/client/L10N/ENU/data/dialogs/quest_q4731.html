          <p>I have a message for you. People tend to leave messages with me, you know, since I'm always standing here. Anyway, this message says to go and speak with [%dic:STR_DIC_N_DF2_Kelmar] over there, in front of the Nobelium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's pretty high up--the head of the Red Hasia Legion in Reshanta. He's probably got some important task for you in the Abyss, so I'd get a move on if I were you.</p>

          <p>It's [%username], right? Good. No time to dilly-dally around. I have a very important mission for you in Reshanta, and I can't be away from my duties for too long.</p>

          <p>We've been having quite a bit of trouble with the graduates of the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_IDAb1_MiniCastle_SZ_D]. Even Balaur have to train somewhere, and I'd like to put the current lot out of the picture before they finish their training.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>With all our elite Daevas off in Tiamaranta, I'm having to recruit some fresh blood to come and give us a hand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, give it some thought--but don't take too long about it. Time's a-wasting!</p>
