          <p>We couldn't set up a full scale excavation site at Alukina's Palace, but just being here is fantastic.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A pity that our research has to compete with the greed of the treasure hunters. We seek understanding--they seek Kinah.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They'd defile the greatest of the ruins if they could turn a profit.</p>

          <p>For archaeologists, there's nothing more important than exploring the ruins. Even when there's danger, we'll chance it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Seiren Whaletamers and Sea Crynacs we ran into last time were extremely dangerous, though. The last time I was attacked, there was barely enough for the Soul Healer to work with.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about lending me your strength, [%userclass]?</p>

          <p>Thanks. Your assistance will be a big help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Deep inside Alukina's Palace, you'll find many Seirens gathered together--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_SeirenBreederD_46_Ae]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Pet_CritonWaterD_44_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Without their interference, the excavation will proceed much more smoothly.</p>
