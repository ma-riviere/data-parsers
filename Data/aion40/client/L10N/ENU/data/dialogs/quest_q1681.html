          <p>I'm really concerned about the other Daevas here. They never laugh, even when I tell them jokes. Everyone's so grim here.</p>

          <p>Two--one to hold the torch and one to glow with divinity. Get it? Glow with...</p>

          <p>I can't take it anymore! People don't get my jokes. Maybe it's the clothes. Maybe I'm just too imposing. That's it! I'll make a new suit. Maybe you could help me?</p>

          <p>Okay, so if you go to the Deathsong Forest, you'll find a plant called  [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_gb_source_plant_40b].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The flower part is a fluff lump, which is [%dic:STR_DIC_LF3_plant_n_c_40a].</p>

          <p>That's what I need. From there I'll be able to weave some fine cloth and make myself a new suit.</p>

          <p>It's excellent. It's more than enough to make some new clothing. Won't tell you what I'm making, though. It would spoil the surprise.</p>
