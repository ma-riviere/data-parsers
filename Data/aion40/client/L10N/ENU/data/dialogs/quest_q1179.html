          <p>Let me give you a piece of advice, friend. Never set up shop in a forsaken hole like this. I thought I'd make a fortune from the pilgrims coming through, but I'll be lucky if I live to spend what little I've made! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The place is crawling with creatures! Really nasty ones. Slimy things, birds that attack you--even the rocks jump up and try to smash your head in!</p>

          <p>I haven't even told you the worst of it! After dark, the dead ones come out. They used to be heroes. Now, they're just empty.</p>    
          <p> </p>          
          <p>It's tragic. Without them, this world would've been taken over by the Balaur eons ago, and now they're just...leeches.</p>

          <p>The Guardians used to dispel the [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA55]s periodically, so there weren't as many of them. Now all the Guardians are busy with the Contaminated Swamp.</p>     
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you dispel a few for me? It's a merciful act, really. They don't remember who they used to be, and I expect it hurts them more to be as they are.</p>

          <p>I'd be glad if you could dispel every single one, but I couldn't take that much of your time. How about ten? They rise up out of the earth after sundown.</p>
