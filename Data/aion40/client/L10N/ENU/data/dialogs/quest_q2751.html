          <p>Oh, the fumes today...they're troubling me more than usual. I've had worse days, though, so no point in complaining.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Too much sulfur is supposed to harm your health, but I don't know if I believe all that. I've heard of positive effects on a sick Aukwi that was fed lumps of flame from a sulfur smoke plume. Of course, Aukwi aren't Humans....I don't really understand it all.</p>

          <p>Yes. Primum recently ordered us all to collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2751a]s. Apparently Pandaemonium wants to do some research!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Sure, we have time to collect lumps of flame! We're only scouting the movements of our deadliest enemies through the most treacherous armpit in the Abyss!! Why not drop everything whenever Pandaemonium wants balflamin' sprigg eyelashes?!</p>

          <p>Oh, I'm sorry Daeva. I'm just...frustrated. Listen, do you have time? It'd spare my men.</p>
