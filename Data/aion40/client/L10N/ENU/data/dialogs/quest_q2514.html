          <p>Beluslan already faces many dangers, but we might have a bigger problem. Specifically, the Balaur who invaded after destroying the Observatory. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We decided to keep an eye on them, and placed a Bind Point in the Red Mane Cavern. It's close enough to the area occupied by Balaur that we can watch them and respond to any provocation.</p>

          <p>The Drakan Punisher Legion is stationed there. They were stationed in the Abyss for a long time, so they know the Balaur well.</p>

          <p>They're being assisted by Centurion Freyja and some Archons, but something must have happened. Neither Freyja nor the Drakan Punisher Legion have reported in.</p>

          <p>Could you go to the Red Mane Cavern and meet [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Thor] of the Drakan Punisher Legion, and Centurion [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Freyja] to get a report?</p>
