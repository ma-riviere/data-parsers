          <p>Daeva! Oh, I am so glad to see you. We need help so badly.</p>

          <p>Of course you've heard we lost the Asteria Fortress. This wouldn't have happened if only we'd had more military strength here at the time!</p>

          <p>All-out war is impossible with our numbers, but raids...raids are something we can manage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We could confuse the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Asteria_Guard], distracting them from their work building a defense wall. That should help us until our reinforcements arrive.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll really need a Daeva's help for this, [%username]. Will you help? For Elysea?</p>

          <p>Thank you. You'll be helping so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Take a group of Daevas and get rid of the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Asteria_Guard]. If you do this, the Daevas who come after you will be able to access the fortress more easily.</p>
