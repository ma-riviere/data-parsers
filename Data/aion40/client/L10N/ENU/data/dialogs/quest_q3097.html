          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF2A_HolyServantVioletNmd_50_Ah]...I've been doing some more research, and I think I've figured out its original purpose.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Like all Malekors, it can absorb and discharge power. Perhaps Theobomos used it to control the flow of energy from the extraction devices.</p>

          <p>No. It was broken--by time, the destruction of Project Drakanhammer, or the death of Theobomos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now it draws all the energy it can into itself, attacking anything that tries to stop it.</p>

          <p>If we don't destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_IDLF2A_HolyServantVioletNmd_50_Ah], it could very well drain the entire facility dry. And who knows what damage that'd do....</p>

          <p>It sounds like the Silikor had gone quite mad with power. Literally.</p>

          <p>A shame it had to be destroyed, but I'm sure there are many other Malekors to study in the facility.</p>
