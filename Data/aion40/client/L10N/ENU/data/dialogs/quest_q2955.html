          <p>Do you see a light in my eyes, Daeva? It is the spark of blood calling to blood. Today my son Aremion will return from serving his people in Reshanta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he was born, I was serving as an Archon. But I knew from the moment I first held him that I couldn't leave him behind for someone else to raise. I retired from military service and since then Aremion has been my life.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>When he ascended I was joyful but...he had opened the door to eternal life, only to learn that he must go to fight in Reshanta, where his soul could be torn from him forever!</p>

          <p>Indeed. I have seen combat, too. I could think of nothing else as I waited for Aremion's return. Every day I would come here to the Temple to pray for his safety. Many have rebuked me for it. It's not the Asmodian way to sit and howl for your absent children.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I promised Azphel in my prayers that if he'd protect Aremion, I would stand vigil here on the Vifrost Bridge each day, in praise of him.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But now...now that Aremion is coming home. I almost fear to rejoice.</p>

          <p>I have decided to hold a banquet to celebrate Aremion's return. Is it not the Asmodian way to welcome home a hero?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The joy that I feel should be shared with others. They too have waited and prayed for his safe return. But of course I can't leave my vigil. I may anger Azphel exactly at the moment his protection is needed most.</p>

          <p>You are a veteran, [%username]. You understand my plight. Many people look up to you. Would you represent me in this, and ask [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Selesti] to arrange the banquet?</p>

          <p>Oh thank you! When you speak to [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Selesti], tell her I don't want an excessive feast. It should be more like a family meal...warm and comfortable, just for his family and friends.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Aremion could have stayed here in Pandaemonium you know, living the easy life...the Five know that there are plenty who have done that. But he's a true Asmodian. His blood led him to the Abyss to do his duty.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And now it's time to welcome him back!</p>

          <p>There are all sorts of reasons to hold a banquet, young Daeva. The Vanahal District is the traditional place for the old families to hold charity banquets for the poor.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Crandale is for the real parties--the wilder the better. There's always a few Daevas due to leave for the Abyss the next day. They make a lot of noise and a big mess, but nobody says a word against them. It might be their last night of fun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, whatever the reason, I'm here to take care of everyone's banqueting needs.</p>

          <p>Karollin? Is her son finally coming home? Well, thank the Five for that! I always felt sorry for her, standing on that bridge like a shade of the dead. Maybe now I'll see her smile again.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've got work piled up to here, but I'm not turning Karollin down. Not if Aremion's really coming back at last.</p>
          <p> </p>
