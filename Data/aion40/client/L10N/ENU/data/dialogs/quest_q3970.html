          <p>What a fine hole I have dug myself into...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I don't mean to talk your ear off. It's my daughter, Harmone. We haven't seen one another for some time...quite some time. And now she wants to rekindle our relationship by spending the rest of her days by my side.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I am very busy, you see. A very busy Daeva. I tried telling her how busy I am, but she will not heed what I have to say. I apologized for leaving her when she was younger, but it did no good. So all I could do was tell her to go back home and that I would come see her once I finished my work here.</p>

          <p>But that crippled old...forgive me, I need to keep my composure. She will not listen to me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>She has found a place in Heiron and writes me letters every day! Every day I get a letter from her! Blessed Elysea, every day!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I realize how awful it must have been to grow up without a father, and I feel ashamed of myself for leaving her. But these letters from her...she only wants me to buy her things! Expensive things! She plays my guilt like a harp.</p>

          <p>Yes, yes she is. But she is an old woman! She shows up after 80 years claiming to be my daughter.... It was unsettling, to say the least!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I did not handle myself well, to be honest with you. I said some horrible things that I now regret. But she didn't get sad--she got angry. She threatened to stand in the center of Sanctum and shout at the top of her lungs that I left her and her mother when they needed me most!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That would ruin my reputation! I didn't have a choice but to play her game. I had to agree to buy her all those shadow-cursed items in her letter. Please, in the name of Ariel, you have to do me a favor. I beg of you!</p>
