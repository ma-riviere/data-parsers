          <p>Don't look so pleased. This is only the upper section of the blade. Agrif took great pains to forge his sword so that it could be wielded by as many Daevas as possible.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daevas favor different weapons, but Agrif wanted to create a perfect weapon that would not be limited. One that satisfies all Daevas at the same time.</p>

          <p>As a result, the five powers of Light, Darkness, Abyss, Rebirth and Destruction were infused into a single blade.</p>

          <p>We gathered the blade fragments of Light, Darkness and Abyss thanks to you, [%username], but there are still two remaining.</p>

          <p>Gather the blade fragments of Rebirth and Destruction, and the blade will be complete. The fragments are hidden in the Ruins of Roah and Lake Asteria.</p>
