          <p>I must tell you more about the origin of the liquor. I made it from ingredients that a Daeva brought to me. He gave me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2423a]s, saying they were from Eltnen. He couldn't find a use for them himself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At first, neither could I. Then it occurred to me that it might add a nice smell to the liquor I was going to make. So, I mixed it in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The result was totally different from what I had expected. I still don't understand what happened, but as you see, the liquor sends the drinker to Elysea!</p>

          <p>Of course, of course. Well, after discovering that it teleports people to Elysea, I tried more experiments. If a liquor can send you to Elysea, why not other places? It would be useful if it could teleport someone to Altgard or Beluslan, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am now working on a new batch of liquor but I'm missing one of the ingredients. I need the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_2423a]s, which are only in Eltnen.</p>
