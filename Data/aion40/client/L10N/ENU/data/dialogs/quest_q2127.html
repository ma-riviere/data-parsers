          <p>You see, recently, I decided to head over to the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1_9]. Of course, I knew there were Mau along the path, but I figured I could avoid them. They aren't the brightest of creatures, after all.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As it turned out, I was wrong and ended up being caught by one of their sentries. I killed him and rummaged through his things, and I found this! Have a look.</p>

          <p>That's just it, it's Citrin Ore! Worth a small fortune!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've done some investigating, and it seems every [%dic:STR_DIC_M_WormbabyD_9_An] carries these valuable ornaments! If I could get my hands on more, I could sell them to my contacts in Pandaemonium for a massive profit.</p>
          <p> </p>
        	<p>There's only one problem--the Mau aren't going to give these up without a fight, and they're too strong for me to take on. You, on the other hand... these guys would be no match for you.</p>
        	<p> </p>
        	<p>Will you kill some Gray Mane Scratchers and bring me back their ornaments? I'll make it worth your while....</p>
