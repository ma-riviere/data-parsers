          <p>The undead are up to something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Usually they act alone. Lately I've seen them fighting as a group--but it's more than that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They seem to be organized--they have a leader.</p>

          <p>Indeed. I've had scouts watching them. There's one undead they appear to follow.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You've been up against these undead before, [%username]. I know you can deal with this upstart.</p>

          <p>Good. That's what I wanted to hear.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's a stone altar in the Patema Ruins. My scouts have seen [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpectreNamedQ_41_An] there at night. It's the perfect opportunity to make a move.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This job should be fledgling's play for a talented Daeva like you--one location, one target.</p>

          <p>Tired of dealing with the undead?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I understand. It's messy business. But we can't resettle this region until we eliminate them. This leader is a complication we didn't expect.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I hope you'll change your mind.</p>

          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! I'm still pondering this idea of the undead having a leader. Coordinated attacks--who would have thought it possible?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Makes me wonder if this Gellar was a military commander during his lifetime. Hmm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, did you eliminate him?</p>
