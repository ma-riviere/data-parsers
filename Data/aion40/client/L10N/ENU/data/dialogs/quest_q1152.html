          <p>I don't know why my foolish husband won't eat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He hunts all about the Tolbas Forest, but gets so involved with his work he ends up skipping meals. He's gotten so thin!</p>     
          <p> </p>
          <p>I keep telling him he has to eat, that he won't have energy to hunt if he doesn't, but he just waves me away with his bony hand.</p>

          <p>Odella. It's the best thing for recovering your health, and he really needs it now.</p>

          <p>Nemia heard I could cook Odella, did she? And this moldy looking substance is Odella?</p>

          <p>Look, I'll be honest...I may have exaggerated. I have no idea how to cook this stuff.</p>

          <p>Leave it with me, though. I am the best cook around--I'm sure I'll be able to turn this into something edible. It probably won't be the sumptuous meal Nemia expected, though.</p>

          <p>Let's see, Odella could be perfect for...soup! But that smell just won't do. No one would eat it like this. Might keep the Kobolds away, though.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'll need something strong enough to mask the smell. Of course! Verteron Pepper. That'll mask anything! Just have to make sure I don't overdo it.</p>

          <p>Now, I must get all my equipment ready. Speaking of which, would you buy me the Verteron Pepper?</p>
