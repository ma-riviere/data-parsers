          <p>War changes everything but war never changes.  Theobomos, a land of learning and prosperity, was reduced to ashes in the crucible of war.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For all their plans, innovations, and courage, Theobomos was destroyed by the inexorable Fregion's Flame.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> - Herodotoh, from the Theobomos wastelands.</p>

          <p> 1. Theobomos, the Borderlands</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos was an arid land but the yeomanry worked hard to cultivate the land and sea and people prospered.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though far from Aion Tower, the land was still partially shielded by the Aetheric Field of Aion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Strong and resilient at its zenith, Theobomos fell far indeed when the Millenium War broke out.</p>

          <p>Skirmishes broke out with the Balaur as Theobomos was at the weakest edge of the Aetheric Field. Too far from Aion Tower for support, the region was on its own.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Theobomans responded to the struggle as they always had, relying on their courage, resilience, and ingenuity to see them through.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Under the leadership of Theobomos the Elder, armed with fantastic weapons developed in Theobomos Lab, the people fought hard.</p>

          <p>2. The Cataclysm </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Frustrated by the Aetheric Field, the Balaur still launched countless skirmishes and battles with Theobomos. The war dragged on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Finally, a cease-fire was declared and the Theobomans gratefully set aside their arms to exult in a few moments of peace, though the Balaur were never far from their thoughts.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Far from the Tower of Aion, the Theobomans never knew why peace prevailed, if only for a moment. They certainly didn't know why it failed.</p>

          <p>With the Aetheric Field gone, the Balaur were free to prey on the Theobomans. They massed a war host unlike any seen before. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos the Elder calmed the citizens and mobilized everyone who could fight, readying for the Balaur onslaught.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos Lab equipped the warriors well, and there were rumors about a fantastic new weapon that would devastate the Balaur.</p>

          <p>3.The Balaur Advance</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Though courageous and stout-hearted, the Theobomans fared poorly against a new legion led by the dreaded Dragon Lord Fregion.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As the defeats mounted, Theobomos the Elder drew sharp criticism for remaining holed up in Theobomos Lab, pursuing his studies rather than guiding the warriors.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Unswayed by the barbs, Theobomos struggled to finish his research and loose his secret weapon upon the Balaur. The war didn't go well, and the proud people were humbled in nearly every battle.</p>

          <p>A superb leader, Theobomos the Elder was best known as a scholar. His isolated stronghold was a series of laboratories.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Wielding the power of Aether, Theobomos crafted weapons to destroy the Balaur and defend his realm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The pinnacle of his research was to be a secret weapon which the scholar hoped would end the war with the Balaur. Few records survived the war, so there was little mention of it.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Dragon Lord Fregion was but a single enemy, but stronger than even his host of troops.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>According to surviving records, a shadow which looked like a Human appeared in the sky. The shadow grew into a giant red dragon, which blotted out the sky.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Searing flames poured from the dragon, vaporizing everything in its path and scarring the land.  The destruction was so complete it remains today, the legacy of the "Fregion's Flame".</p>

          <p>Staggered by Fregion's might, Humans and Daevas lost the will to fight, and the Drakan troop under Fregion devastated Theobomos.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos the Elder vanished during the fighting and the Theoboman forces faltered without leadership.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur and their Drakan forces swept across Theobomos as the battle became a rout.</p>

<p>4. Fregion Ascendant  </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Theobomos's secret weapon might have staved off defeat, even turned the tide against the Balaur, but it never took the field.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Despite occasional victories against the Balaur, the Theobomans couldn't even slow the inexorable tide of foes. Fregion's might was too great to counter.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Time and time again, Fregion swept across the sky, incinerating his foes and clearing the way for his minions to sweep up the remnants.</p>

          <p>Fregion advanced relentlessly, driving his forces to the coast. The great dragon poured flames into the ocean until the waters boiled.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Seawater vaporized and seabed turned to desert. Scalding steam filled the region, making everyone but Fregion miserable.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Everything in southern Theobomos died. The Bab-el-Madeb straits were hit the hardest. Port Anangke was destroyed, leaving only some ruins as the advance continued.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Fregion systematically destroyed the settlements and villages of Theobomos before turning his attention to the capital.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The entire city was immolated by the great dragon, the cursed flames enduring long after anything remained to burn. The pitifully few survivors scattered and fled, broken and hopeless.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Had the Empyrean Lords dispatched a host to bolster Theobomos, nothing would have changed. The destruction was absolute.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>However, the Drakan Legion did not give up. The Balaur troops advanced to the west, to the Theobomos Stronghold, the final bastion in the region.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The Balaur legion crushed the resistance at the Research Center before trying to savage the scholar's refuge, to utterly destroy Theobomos the Elder's legacy.</p>
