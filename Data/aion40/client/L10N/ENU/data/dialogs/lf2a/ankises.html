          <p>How much do you know about the Scorchlands? During the Cataclysm, the Dragon Lord Fregion set the place aflame and it's still burning! It's a wasteland now.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've studied fire endlessly, but I comprehend those unquenchable flames only tenuously. The power of the Balaur is fundamentally different from ours.</p>   
          <p> </p>
