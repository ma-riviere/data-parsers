          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes! I'm a Guardian! All those other dumb legions who rejected me can go float in the Abyss for all I care. Finally, a legion that understands my value!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those snarky Miragent Holy Templars'll regret turning me down. Once I become famous, they'll all be awed by my battle tactics. But I'll be magnanimous...I'll agree to teach strategy classes at their yearly meetings...but they'll have to ask real nice.</p>

          <p>Day 10</p>
          <p>It's been hideous. All this night training...in the rain! I keep telling them that I'm getting a cold, but no one pays any attention. I think I have a fever too...and my throat is so sore I almost cried while sipping the honey tea mom sent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It would sure be nice to have mom here right now. She'd tell 'em that I need more rest! And that you shouldn't be able to wring out your socks!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if that's not bad enough, they just assigned me a new training partner! Argh! So, now I've got to rearrange all of my stuff. His name's Galus. He's from a farm in Poeta. Has the brain power of a Kobold, but I suppose he's nice enough.</p>

          <p>Day 30</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This is so totally annoying. Everyone keeps borrowing money. How do they even know I have money? I hope Galus isn't going around shooting his mouth off.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I suppose I should keep a tally...so the slackers'll pay me back. Let's see...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> - Galus: 5600 Kinah (to cover last week's bill at Dionysia Tavern)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> - Rollia: 14500 Kinah (to mend the robe she ripped while mud wrestling a swamp Starturtle. OK, that may have been worth the cost. I may just let that one ride.)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> - Marlee: 3690 Kinah (410 Kinah per day for nine days...for snacks...she says...)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> - Chloris: 45000 Kinah (No explanation. But I'll find out!)</p>
          <p>-------------------- </p>
          <p> Total Outstanding: 68790 Kinah. Shards!</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>We're going to get our assignments soon. I can't wait to see where they send me. Somewhere important, no doubt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My classmates all want to be posted in Reshanta, but they have no imagination. And they certainly don't have my talents.</p>

          <p>Yustiel's wing feathers! I think I'm in love.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't even look at her without turning red. And Aion forbid I try to open my mouth! What a moron! But she's sooo beautiful! That hair! And those purple eyes! Surely divine!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't believe this. It's only my first day here and I've already found the love of my life. I knew they had great plans for me when they posted me in Tolbas Village, but I never dreamed that fate would bring me to her.</p>

          <p>Shards! Trying to talk to her makes me feel like a total knuckle-dragger. What a trog!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can't focus. I can't sleep...I'm a wreck! Galus suggests that I write her a poem instead of trying to talk to her, but maybe I should write to mom and ask her what I should do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I guess I could write a poem. How hard can it be?</p>

          <p>Oh Aion! She looked at me today! I was serving at lunch, and she looked straight in my eyes and asked for Odella Soup! I've got to write that poem!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>(lines of scribbled out writing.)</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Tower's ashes! This is way harder than it sounded! I'd better go grab some poetry books to look at...for inspiration.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>I spied on her reading my poem...she read it out loud! And everyone laughed! Maybe I can get reassigned to Heiron...that would be closer to mom anyway...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I should've never listened to Galus! What an idiot! I should have know that slinking poem idea would never work! Dumb! Dumb! Dumb!</p>

          <p>One more day of dust storms like that, and I swear I'll go mad! The noise! Who knew dust storms where so sharding loud! I stuffed cotton in my ears, but it barely dampens the noise in my helmet. Louder than the Lighterica concert.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that I'll ever get to another concert. Nothing ever happens here. And she still won't talk to me. It's so unfair! Can't she see how much I care for her and how great we'd be together?</p>

          <p>Aion's wing feathers! It's so Aionical! The Sunsoaked armor set is out! It's so righteous! It's got the new jeweled manastone expansion slots and high titanium gloss! Awesome! I can't believe the level of accuracy they managed infuse it with ...so shading cool!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I bet if I had one of those she'd look at me. Shards! If I had one of those any of the girls would look at me. I could have my pick. They'd be lining up! Then she'd be sorry!</p>

          <p>I got a commendation for my awesome work on the last mission. The Captain presented it...in front of everyone! Now they'll all have to give me the respect I deserve.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I asked Galus to hit the tavern with me to celebrate, but he turned me down cold. What's up with that?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could he be jealous? I bet he is. He's always so self-centered.</p>

          <p>Unbelievable. Stuck in an Aion forsaken inn on my first mission in Eltnen. I can't believe my bad luck.</p>

          <p>Well, at least the food is pretty good. And the barkeep is rather cute...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But what's the deal with the guys next room? Talk about noisy! What are they doing in there? I had to bury my head under my pillow all night. I'll have to talk to the innkeeper about moving to a new room if this continues. Blasted kids!</p>
