          <p>It's so frustrating. No one seems to be willing to take up the mantle of Guardianship.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ascension is more than just wings and power. It's a sign from the Empyrean Lords marking you as a champion of Elysea.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Safety is more important than sacrifice these days, though. Why else would so few of us agree to come here?</p>

          <p>Because this is a barren wasteland, that's why. There is nothing here to tempt anyone--no beauty, no hope.</p>
          <P> </P>
          <P>After Fregion's attack, everything was destroyed. The Guardians were sent here after the Aetheric Field was created, but there's little left to protect.</P>

          <p>It would be good to see the Akarios Plains again.</p>
