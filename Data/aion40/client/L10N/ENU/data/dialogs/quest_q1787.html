          <p> </p>
          <p>Some of Sanctum's most high ranking officials are visiting us. Morale boosting, they call it. Thought they'd just saunter in after inspecting the Teminon Landing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is, we aren't ready. Everyone has been running about like wingless Asmodians trying to get everything prepared. I've nearly screamed myself hoarse, and time is fast running out.</p>

          <p>Yes, always my friend! I've been told to have the nearby Balaur gone for the visit, but have had trouble rounding up enough good soldiers.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>You might have just saved the day, [%username]! Now we can concentrate on getting this place ship-shape and you can concentrate on clearing out the Balaur.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've organized a few others to help out, but if you could kill seven [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_NagaFighter_40_An]s, five [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_NagaKnight_39_An]s, and three [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Ab1_1231_NagaWizard_39_An]s, then the others should have an easier time of it.</p>

          <p>Good luck, [%username]. With Ariel's grace the sun will light your path and blind your enemies. Faith and arms.</p>

          <p>Now for the good news: it turns out the Sanctum officials aren't visiting after all. Funny how their visit was intended as a morale booster, yet it was the news that they weren't coming that cheered us up!</p>
