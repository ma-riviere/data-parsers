          <p>We've been so concerned about the Balaur in the Indratu Barracks that I think we've taken the Krall for granted.</p>

          <p>The Krall have a knack for distilling Odium, but here, I think they're forging it into a weapon.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They have something that looks like a forge. I tried to investigate but they swarmed me. I had to retreat.</p>

          <p>We're an observation post, not a fortress. If the Krall develop a new weapon, we'll be its first target.</p>

          <p>No, I'm not sure of anything. That's why I want you to go on a spying mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return after you have spied on the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1661A], [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1661B], and [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1661C].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need to know how the Krall are processing Odium and what they're making with it. Once we know that, we can defend ourselves.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1661B] is on a hill to the right of the Weapon Forge. It gives off green smoke and has two windmills. Behind the Odium Refinery is the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_SensoryArea_Q1661C]. </p>

          <p>Piros recently discovered a strange, green smoke rising from Kishar Village, and he asked you to spy on the Odium Refinery and the forges because the Krall might be making a new weapon out of Odium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You spied on the structures and went back to report that there was no suspicious activity, but Piros was still concerned that there is something wrong.</p>
