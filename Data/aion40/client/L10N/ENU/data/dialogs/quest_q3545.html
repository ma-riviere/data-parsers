          <p>Another official letter from the Heiron Union Manager of the Manastone Removers Association. They're raising manastone monthly quotas and demand I oblige.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing but bad news since we started this union! You know what they call this little corner here? The New Heiron Gate branch office. Classy, huh?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These orders are getting harder to fill, too. HP +50, Accuracy +18, and Block +18 manastones...in bundles of 10 each. Can you help me get them? I'm authorized to reward you.</p>

          <p>Oh, you're a blessing, [%username], sent by Lady Ariel. Actually, union rules now say that we only reference Nezekan, the Lord of Justice, with union-related comments.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He's become the patron lord of the Manastone Removers Association. Somehow, unions equate to justice or something.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the HP +50s, Accuracy +18s, and Block +18s are pretty common manastones. Have any in your cube or warehouse?</p>
