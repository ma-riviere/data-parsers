          <p>Thank you for waiting. Your necklace is done! </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You aren't a master Handicrafter, are you? Here, I'll give you a quick lesson. Look at the rainbow reflection on the surface of the pearl--you don't see pearls of this quality everyday.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And the diamond--check out the way it catches the light! It's like motes of sunlight that float around the necklace.</p>

          <p>I could go on about the three Cs, but that's not what you're here for, I suppose.</p>

          <p>Custom jewelry is usually a chore, but with materials like this, it was a pleasure.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Cheorunerk ordered the necklace, but he wants you to deliver it, right? Make sure [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Shugo_LF2a_10] gets it--the sooner the better.</p>

        <p>I think maybe Cheorunerk is on to something--look how happy he is. I've been married more than once, and it sure wasn't a recipe for happiness, if you know what I mean.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>I never gave any of my wives a necklace like this, though. You don't suppose they expected me to make jewelry for them, do you?</p>
