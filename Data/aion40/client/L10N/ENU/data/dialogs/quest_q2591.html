	        <p>I'm a little weak with calculations, but I worked really hard to become an administration officer. And now I have an abacus, so I'm generally less confused.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>But don't worry, I'm never confused about coin rewards. I give items to Gladiators, Templars, Assassins, and Rangers.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>Ten or twenty gold coins? How many do you have?</p>

	        <p>Ten gold coins, eh?</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>You must have fought many spirits at Anair Harbor to collect so many. And quite a few Balaur in Draupnir Cave as well, I suspect.</p>
	        <p> </p>
	        <p>This item should be useful whether you face a spirit or a Balaur. Beluslan needs you, and Pandaemonium is grateful for your help.</p>
