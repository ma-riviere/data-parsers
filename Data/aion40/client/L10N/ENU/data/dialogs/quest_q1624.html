          <p>Ah, not you, [%username]. It's the supplies, they're that rusted with all the seawater. I couldn't cut up a Qooqoo with even one of them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These won't do, but Lantis told me there are  [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OBJ_LF3_AncientWeapon_Q1624]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_OBJ_LF3_AncientArmor_Q1624]s lying all over the Patema Ruins. The Abyss War raged hot there, and the battlefield still holds its treasure. They would serve the purpose until new items could be shipped or made. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you be willing, [%username], to help the fleet and bring back some swords and shields? I'd reward you handsomely for the work.</p>
