          <p>Curse this darkness! I can't read or write orders when the darkness sets in, and we don't get much wood for the fires.</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>I know, I know...the darkness makes us stronger. I've heard it all as a youngster. Those arrogant Elyos sure have it easy, though, bathing in sunlight and never struggling like me, just to make out Ulgorn's handwriting.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have a temporary solution, though. It's not the sun, but at least Guheitun won't complain about me using all the firewood.</p>

          <p>Look around: Which creature in this environment catches your eye? Either the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_spakyD_1_n] or the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpakleD_1_n], right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's their glowing tails. The insects use them to attract prey and mates. But I can make use of that natural luminescence, too.</p>

          <p>They don't go dark right away. In fact, their abdomens stay alight for several hours after you sever them from the thorax.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But I'm sure the proper names of bug parts don't concern you, and I have a heap of paperwork in any case. [%username], I need you to catch a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_spakyD_1_n] or two as well as a few [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpakleD_1_n]s and gather their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_2105a]s for me. I'll sort my paperwork and await your return.</p>

          <p>Vanar should be writing orders as Ulgorn requested. However, he's having trouble reading and writing because the Aldelle Basin gets so dark.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>He requested you catch a [%dic:STR_DIC_M_spakyD_1_n] or two and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_SpakleD_1_n]s and collect their abdomens, which are naturally luminescent.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You collected the light spheres as he requested. He was delighted and said that he should be able to write the orders Ulgorn requested.</p>
