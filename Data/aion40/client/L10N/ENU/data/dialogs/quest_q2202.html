          <p>Ugh. The Commander is set on our clearing away the Lobnites from outside the fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, I understand that we need to keep the area safe for the residents, but he doesn't realize the pressure I'm already under!</p>

          <p>My studies are serious business. They take up quite a chunk of time, you know. I have a stack of papers that I haven't even looked at.</p>

          <p>Way to sound like him. And my parents.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Look, I need help. That's what I need. If you're interested in helping a poor, young scholar instead of insulting him, that is.</p>

          <p>If you'd defeat [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LobniteD_10_n]s near [%dic:STR_DIC_W_DF1A_2], outside the fortress walls, I really would be grateful.</p>
