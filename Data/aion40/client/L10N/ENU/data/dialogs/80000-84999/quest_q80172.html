          <p>This is from my father. Oh, oh no. My mother is ill, but there's nothing I can do while I'm posted here in Pandaemonium. Am I a terrible son?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What should I do? I can't leave my post, but it doesn't sound like my father can handle this by himself.</p>

          <p>Well, thank you for bringing me the letter.</p>
