          <p>[%username]! It's good to see you again. I still remember the day I bestowed a Durable Daevanion weapon upon you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Perhaps you wish to exchange it for a different kind of weapon? I just need a reminder about what kind you have already. And, of course, twenty [%dic:STR_DIC_DC_relic_exchange_30]s to properly transfer the bindings from the old weapon to the new.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is that what you wanted? Then tell me what weapon you already possess?</p>

          <p>Physical weapons? I should have known. What kind specifically? Sword, Greatsword, Polearm, Dagger, or Bow?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, of course a Bow is a physical weapon. It's used to fill one's targets with pointy physical arrows, is it not?</p>

          <p>Very well then. Sometimes a particular weapon seems like a good idea at first, but over time, it just doesn't seem to fit. Maybe that's what happened to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you have the twenty Daevanion's Lights that I'll need for this? If you do, then all I need to know is what kind of a weapon you want to use now.</p>
