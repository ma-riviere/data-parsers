          <p>Oh my! I was almost knocked off my feet when you walked in, Daeva. The sense of power surrounding you is palpable.</p>

          <p>Knock it--? How rude! Well, if you wish to risk so much when the alternative is so simple, that is I suppose your perogative.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just one token of your success, a worthless little thing, really. That is all I need. And you won't even have to go out of your way to find it.</p>
