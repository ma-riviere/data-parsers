          <p>I am an agent of a...covert organization that answers to none but Lord Nezekan. We perform...missions all across Atreia.</p>

          <p>I have been running an important operation with my colleague Emeele. Unfortunately, I've run into a...stumbling block.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd fix my own mess, but I can't let my schedule slip any further. I could use the assistance of an able Daeva like you, for Elysea's sake.</p>

          <p>I knew I could count on you. To explain: I was attacked and robbed by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_ElementalFire2_LIGHT_99_n].</p>

          <p>Kill them and take the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80058A]s stolen from me. They may look like ordinary leaves, but they are a deadly poison vital to my mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid that's all I can tell you. Good luck, and be careful handling the herbs.</p>
