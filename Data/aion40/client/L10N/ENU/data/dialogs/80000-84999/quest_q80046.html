          <p>Ah, summer. The one time of year when the temperature becomes bearable. Winters are always pretty hard, expecially on kids, so I remember it was always such a relief when summer came around. Every time the weather starts heating up, it reminds me of that feeling.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, this year, I decided I would revisit my youth. My parents used to dress me up in these little sailor costumes, and take me out on the boat. Don't laugh! I bet you have some skeletons in your closet!</p>

          <p>Well, I hated it at the time, but now I realize that childhood really was the best time of my life. So, this year, I found this old sailboat, a bit the worse for wear, and was going to try and get it fixed up in time to take a sailing trip while it was still warm.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80046A]s cut ready for the repairs, but these monsters at Idun's Lake made off with them, and I need to get them back.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know this isn't exactly a fun summer party, but--oh, hey! You know what I just remembered? I used to dare my friends to do stuff all the time when we were kids, so maybe this could be a dare?</p>

          <p>I knew the dare thing would appeal to you, [%username]. Thanks.</p>

          <p>The bad news is: those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80046A]s may have been eaten by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearS_13_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_EElemental1stD_13_n]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_MosbearS_14_An]s.</p>

          <p>You've saved my tail, [%username]. Maybe you'd like this costume to help you revisit your own youth? Never mind that we can't actually go sailing until I get this thing fixed...</p>

          <p>Olatis had planned some childlike festivities to recapture his youth, but the boards for repairing the sailboat were stolen by monsters.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You recovered the boards, but it seems unlikely that the boat will be ready in time.</p>
