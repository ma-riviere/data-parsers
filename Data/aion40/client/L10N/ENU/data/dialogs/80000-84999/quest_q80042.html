          <p>If everything had gone according to plan, we'd be at the beach right now. Swimming, sandcastles, crestlich-back polo... And, best of all, a sailing ship waiting to take us to a tropical island.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only, our boats need repairing from last year, and monsters have made off with all the materials.</p>

          <p>No idea. They just want to spoil our fun? Anyway, even though we had to put our plans on hold, I thought, why not recreate another thing from our youth--dares? Are you feeling brave, Daeva?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Then I double daru dare you to go to the Southern Tolbas Forest and reclaim the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80042A]s from the monsters!</p>

          <p>Yes, yes, these are the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80042A]s we lost. They just need a bit of cleaning, and they'll be good as new.</p>
