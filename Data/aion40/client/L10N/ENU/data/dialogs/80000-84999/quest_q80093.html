          <p>Oh, the kind [%userclass]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those souls you brought me were really helpful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been trying different divinations and incantions, trying to unlock their secret, but I just don't think I have enough material to work with.</p>

          <p>No, I get glimmers and impressions from the souls, but nothing concrete.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Could I trouble you to bring me some more? In fact, I bet I'd be able to get a better reading if you were to bring me Soul Essences.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What? No, I haven't done anything bad. Those witch hunters are deranged and dangerous. I'm pretty sure it's from too much exposure to those ghostly souls! In fact, I think those souls are contagious!</p>

          <p>Yes! That's it...the force behind those ghosts, it must have become entwined in their soul!</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>I know there are [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_LehparAs_48_An]s in the area. I can feel them, like a million tiny spiders, creeping up my back. Ewwww!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Please, help them! Set them free of their corruption and bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80093A]s. With those extra souls, I'm sure I'll be able to figure out why they're after me!</p>
