          <p>I would be most grateful if you'd allow me to use my meager talents to give your destiny a little nudge in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Excellent choice! You won't regret it. In fact, the task I will give you is something you were almost certainly planning to do already. It is simply this: survive the fourth stage of the Crucible Challenge.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>At the end of that stage, a special--but totally worthless--little token will fall to the ground. Bring me that Crucible Mark, will you?</p>

          <p>So set in your ways. So inflexible. I foresaw our conversation going this way, but I knew I must give you an opportunity to prove me wrong.</p>

          <p>The good news is that I also foresee you changing your mind! And when that happens, I will be here... unless I'm not.</p>

          <p>Ah--ahem--all for your benefit of course. Thank you. No, in fact, you should be thanking me. You'll be seeing the results soon. But not me, for I have to leave imminently.</p>
