          <p>Hello again, [%username]. The Shapers of Dusk would like to give you a little test this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find this mission a little more complex than the last one, but I'm sure it will still be easy for you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After all, you had no problems with those Starved Mosbears.</p>

          <p>Glad you're on board. Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA_194]. Some Slinks and Lobnites escaped from a laboratory there, and have mixed in with the local wildlife.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You won't be able to tell the difference, so just kill as many as you find. Bring me and  [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80194a] and [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80194b] that you pick up.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>Now remember, you won't be able to tell the escaped Slinks and Lobnites apart from their wild comrades, but the local population could use some culling regardless.</p>

          <p>They were just test animals, and, I'm reliably informed, were injected with very very few mutagens. There's almost no chance of you getting bitten and turning into... well... anything!</p>
