          <p>Arieluma, [%username]! You've become quite the successful [%userclass], haven't you? Great battles, daring rescues... I'm sure you've already had quite a few adventures, right?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>A Daeva like you deserves an appropriate piece of armor, something truly worthy of your skills.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to help you, if you've got a few minutes to listen.</p>

          <p>Yes, I've received several pieces of a fantastic new Daevanion armor. It's custom fitted to the wearer, and nearly impossible to find anywhere else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is, my supplier is a bit of a collector, with a taste for some of the rarer items available in Sanctum. I'm going to need to send him 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_LC_relic_armor_30]s in payment for each of these armor pieces.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Can you get them? The results will be worth your trouble, I promise.</p>
