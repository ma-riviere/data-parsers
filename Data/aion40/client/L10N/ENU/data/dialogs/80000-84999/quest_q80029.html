          <p>Hmm, let's put that to the test!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will give you some Charm Cards. Some might bring you great rewards. Others, well, who knows? But first I must read your palm, so that I can channel the right mystical energies which will guide me to choose the fortunes that are meant for you.</p>

          <p>Here, take your Charm Cards and stop asking silly questions. And if you're don't like what you got, maybe [%dic:STR_DIC_N_event_Harmonan] has something you'll like better.</p>
