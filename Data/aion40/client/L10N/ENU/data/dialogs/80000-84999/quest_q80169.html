          <p>The Millenium Festival. Ah, what a wonderful celebration this is!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I wonder how the Elyos celebrate it? Probably by staring in mirrors for an all-day self-congratulation marathon.</p>

          <p>Ha! You're right! But that's neither here nor there. We're here to enjoy ourselves and NOT think of the glow-worms for a bit.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One of the things you can to do make the most of this Millenium Festival is earn valuable prizes.</p>
          <p> </p>
 	        <p>In fact, my job is to offer some. All you have to do is put in a little effort--if you're interested.</p>

          <p>The effort comes in getting [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_07] from foes all across Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Just do what you normally do in support of Asmodae--you'll get plenty. Once you have enough, you trade it in for prizes.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>You seem like the battle-hardened type; perhaps you have already earned a prize?</p>

          <p>I understand how you feel. It's hard to have fun when you know your fellow Daevas are fighting, sweating, and dying out there.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>But exhausted, demoralized, and burnt out soldiers do not win wars. We owe it to ourselves and Asmodae to rest when we can.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>I suggest you take the time to get into the Millenium Festival spirit. You'll feel so much better when you return to the fray.</p>

          <p>The [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_07] is specially made to be inedible. That's how monsters carry it without eating it.</p>

          <p>Of course, it's not exactly palatable. Have you ever tried it? Yeah.</p>

      	  <p>Fortunately, you can run across it just in your normal duties as a Daeva.</p>
