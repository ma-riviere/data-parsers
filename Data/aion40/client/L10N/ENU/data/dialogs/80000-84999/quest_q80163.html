          <p>Welcome to the Millenium Festival, the celebration so tied to all Atreians, even the Asmodians observe it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, they probably do it by sacrificing small animals and growling at each other, but that's neither here nor there.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know what my favorite part of the Festival is? Clowns!</p>

          <p>Yes, clowns! How can anyone not like clowns? They're so jolly, with their clothes and their face paint!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>My friend Bigos is afraid of them for some bizarre reason! A huge hulking Gladiator like him, afraid of clowns! How amusing!</p>
          <p> </p>
 	        <p>Say, one of the prizes I'm offering for my Millenium Festival promotion will help you get into the clowning mood, if you're interested!</p>

          <p>All you have to do is give me enough [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_05]s. You can find them on monsters across Atreia.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>Trade them in to me for all sorts of prizes, including, of course, pieces of a clown outfit.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>You can dazzle and delight your friends... provided you have enough of the required item, of course. You should check.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, to feel the paint upon my skin, put on those frilly clothes, and step into the cheering crowds of children....</p>

          <p>Perhaps someday. For now, I collect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_05]s.</p>

	        <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry, though; we made sure that all Daevas could collect them no matter how they fight for Elysea.</p>
