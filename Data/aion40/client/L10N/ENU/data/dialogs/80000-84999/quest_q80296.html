          <p>Is plate armor too harsh on your delicate skin? Did you pick out leggings only to realize that what you really needed were gloves? [%username], if you wish to change the Durable Daevanion armor piece that you chose, then let us talk.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I will need ten [%dic:STR_DIC_DC_relic_exchange_30]s to make the exchange. Why ten? Because it takes five to undo the previous bonding, and five to make the new bonding.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Does it really matter why? The point is that I need them. Now what kind of armor do you currently have?</p>
