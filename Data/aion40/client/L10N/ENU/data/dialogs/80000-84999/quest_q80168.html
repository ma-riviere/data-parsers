          <p>I have to admit, some of the prizes at this year's Millenium Festival are somewhat... odd.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>For example, in my batch... Well, let me put it this way: do you have fond memories of school?</p>

          <p>You don't? Well, perhaps that's fortunate. My memories are not good, I can tell you that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yet some of the prizes I'm giving out are school-themed. Is nostalgia really that powerful?</p>

          <p>All you have to do is gather [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_06] from monsters across Atreia.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's a special type that you can only find during the Millennium Festival.</p>

          <p>You may have come across some already. In that case, I can give you a prize of your choice right now.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>From what I remember, it comes from the skies during light showers. It's rare, but kind of worthless, which makes it perfect for contests such as these.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>Hah, I can't believe I remember that. And here I thought I hated school. Anyway, I suppose you're here to turn some in?</p>

          <p>Let me check. It's not that I don't trust you, but you'd be surprised at how many Daevas try to pull a fast one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you are one of the honest ones, it seems! Please choose whatever prize you want. I know what I'd pick, personally.</p>

          <p>Still, you can return once a day to get other prizes. I hope I see you again some other time.</p>
