          <p>Those blasted Star Debris really screwed up my timetable. I'm going to have to entrust you with something very important here.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That letter I just gave you contains information that should get to Emeele. But I'm expecting an even more vital letter from her.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We can't meet directly. It's too dangerous for us both.</p>

          <p>Oh, Aion, no! It's still too risky, still too direct a connection between me and Emeele. Fortunately, we already have someone in place.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll find him undercover with the Verteron Trade Brokers.</p>
