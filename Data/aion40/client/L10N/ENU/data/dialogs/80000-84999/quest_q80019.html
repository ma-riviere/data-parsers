          <p>Daeva, I am so sorry to ask this again, but...yeah, I'm looking for socks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm starting to think that the Grankers are doing this just to mess with me.</p>

          <p>Yeah, and it's the same socks, too! Can't teach a Granker new tricks, I guess.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>See, I hung them up, filled them with gifts, and, when I turned my back...poof! You know, if socks can go 'poof'.</p>

          <p>I didn't see it happen, but I just know it was those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_XmasEvent_Rudolph_99_n]s again. Can you chase them down for me? You're the best at that!</p>

          <p>Oh, and the socks were grubby enough when you brought them back last time, so I can't imagine what they look like by now.</p>

          <p>Please, Daeva, find those [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80019a]s.</p>

          <p>No, no, I get it. This is my responsibility. I know I can't go running all over Asmodae on my own, but I have to tell the festival organizers.</p>
