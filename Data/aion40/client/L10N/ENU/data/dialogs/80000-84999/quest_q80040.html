          <p>Arieluma! To the wisdom and free thought of children across Elysea!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Is this your first Enlightenment Festival?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm afraid your first experience may not be the best, Daeva. We've run into a problem.</p>

          <p>Well, the paper kites we use in our ceremony were all pretty banged up, and the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A]s we use to repair them have been stolen!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>These old kites have been handed down for generations--we have to repair them each year with the Paper Scales. But some Daevas found out that Paper Scales are also great for polishing wing feathers. Giving them that perfect shine!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now we're left with broken kites and three very shiny Daevas. We could end up with disappointed kids as well. Would you help us?</p>

          <p>I think I know who took the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A]s. See those Daevas over there, primping and acting like they don't see us? That's them!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the only places I know to find more Paper Scales are Haramel, the Nochsana Training Camp, Kromede's Trial, the Fire Temple, the Steel Rake, and Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you've been to one of those places recently, you may have some in your Cube...not that I'm accusing you of anything, Daeva. We all need to primp now and then. Could you check, though?</p>

          <p>Well, the Enlightenment Festival has probably run its course anyways.</p>

          <p>The kites are an important part of the ceremony. It's a tradition handed down over hundreds of years.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Paper Scales can be found in Haramel, the Nochsana Training Camp, Kromede's Trial, the Fire Temple, the Steel Rake, and Dark Poeta.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have you been to any of those places? Might you have come across those Paper Scales?</p>

          <p>Nope, no...don't see enough [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A] in your bag.</p> 
	        <p> </p>
          <p>If you're headed towards Haramel, the Nochsana Training Camp, Kromede's Trial, the Fire Temple, the Steel Rake, or Dark Poeta, could you find some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_CHILDREN_SCROLL_SHIELD_ALL_30A]s?</p> 
	        <p> </p>
          <p>I think 20 should cover it. That'll get the children very enlightened.</p>
