          <p>I am sorry, Daeva, but you don't appear to have the ten Daevanion's Lights that I asked you for. Without them, I can't allow you to exchange your armor. Go to Perena or Ophenes in Caps and Straps on the Divine Road. They'll be able sell what I need.</p>

          <p>When you comeback, remember that you need both the Durable Daevanion Armor piece you want to exchange, and ten Daevanion's Lights.</p>
