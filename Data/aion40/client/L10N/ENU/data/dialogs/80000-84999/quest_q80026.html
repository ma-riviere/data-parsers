          <p>You have to eat to stay fit, but some people take it to extremes. Oh, not you, but have you thought about helping those who are less fortunate?</p>

          <p>Hmm. A little defensive. Guilty conscience, perhaps?</p>

          <p>I have the perfect way to make up for it. I'm trying to put together some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_NEWYEAR_01A]es for the poor, but the supply wagon was attacked by monsters. Will you help me out?</p>

          <p>Oh, so maybe you know what I'm talking about? You know, it wasn't so long ago that my mom was going hungry so I could get fed, and you don't forget that kind of thing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What I need is 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_FOOD_NEWYEAR_3STATS]s, 10 [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_POTION_HP_MP_40A], and 10 bottles of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_NEWYEAR_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A] for for a medium lunch box.</p>
