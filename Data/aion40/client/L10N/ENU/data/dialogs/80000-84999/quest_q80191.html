          <p>It's simple, really. Go to [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09], kill the Slinks that escaped from the lab, and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80190a].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>After that, you need to kill the escaped Lobnites and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80190b].</p>

          <p>Simple, right?</p>
