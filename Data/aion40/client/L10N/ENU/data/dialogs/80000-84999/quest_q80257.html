          <p>You mean you don't know? I'm shocked that any Daeva could be so ill-informed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was hand-picked to coordinate this special Daeva's Day celebration. I am both the chief planner, and the chef! I have personally prepared the banquet behind me for Daevas like yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not only that, but the banquet itself is imbued with a special magical spell that will abundantly bless every Daeva in its vicinity.</p>

          <p>Oh, yes. Yes, that would be quite nice. I'm having trouble keeping up with all the demand.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We keep running out of food, with all the Daevas coming to enjoy the banquet. They all seem to especially enjoy the cupcakes.</p>

          <p>Actually, do you think if I gave you some ingredients, you could help make a few of the more popular items?</p>

          <p>Just stand near the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_World_dinner_of_Devas_Day_L] here, and use these ingredients. Easy, isn't it?</p>
