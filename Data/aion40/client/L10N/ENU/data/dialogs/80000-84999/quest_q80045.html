          <p>Ahh, summer's here again! The summer was my favorite time of year as a kid. What about you, Daeva? Long, warm days with nothing much to do. Now I see why the grown-ups used to tell me those were the best days of my life! Oh to have them back again...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had this whole plan where I was going to get all my friends together, and we were going to dress up in sailor costumes like we had as kids, and sail a real boat to an island somewhere. You know, something we all wanted to do when we really were children, but our parents wouldn't let us.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only problem is...</p>

          <p>The sailboat I got turned out to need some repairs. I had all these [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80045A]s cut specially for it, but they got intercepted on the way here through the Nolantis ruins.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So now, instead of asking you to join me for some fun and relaxation on my sailboat, [%username], I have to ask you to rescue my planks from the monsters that ate them.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>How about we make it a game? You must have played dare games as a kid, right? See, this is almost as good as the boat thing!</p>

          <p>Oh, thank you, [%username]! Now, what you need to know is that the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80045A]s were most likely eaten by the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Maidengolem_43_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Graveknight_44_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Spectre_44_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_DeathKnight_45_Ae]s.</p>

          <p>I suppose you should take this sailor suit thing. I planned to wear mine on the sailing trip, but it'll take me ages to actually fix this boat up, so there's no point in letting it go to waste.</p>
