          <p>Greetings, [%userclass]! Welcome to Daru Days!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like to learn about the many benefits Darus can offer everyone from the battle-hardened Daeva to the stay-at-home parent?</p>

          <p>Why, the Daru is a great animal! It has a warm wool that makes all sorts of clothes, and the meat is succulent!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I know they sort of come from Asmodae, but they're not Daevas, so that shouldn't be a problem, right? Not for these critters!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Why don't you learn firsthand about the wonders of the great animal called Daru?</p>

          <p>Yippee! Now, the best way to learn is by doing. That's why I want you to get [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80076A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't worry, you don't need to go to Asmodae. I have Flamehide Darus penned in the Coliseum especially for demonstration!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll have to knock them out to shear them, and that's a big job. So bring friends or legion members.</p>

          <p>Once you interact with these wonderful creatures, I just know you'll agree: Darus are baa-rilliant!</p>
