          <p>Ah! There you are!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was looking for you, [%username]. These summer days got me reminiscing, thinking about how things used to be, about the path I've walked, the things I've seen, the things I've done....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But my story is nothing like yours. Nothing at all. I was curious--have you ever been back to where all this started?</p>

          <p>Yes! One of the jewels of Elysea...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Maybe you should go back and take stock of everything you've accomplished this far. I believe that our beginnings provide context for all that we do in life. Maybe by visiting Poeta, you will garner a better understanding of where your life is headed?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And if not, you can still sample some of the region's treasures! I've drawn up a list here of the best things Poeta has to offer. You can take it, if you like.</p>

          <p>Good! Now here's a guidebook with clues on each location. I've always believed treasures should be earned, not given--you'll have to discover these yourself.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you manage to figure the clues out, you'll find someone waiting for you with souvenirs. A little memoir of your roots, if you will.</p>

          <p>This view doesn't change though, does it? Still catches my breath every time I see it. Glistening waves, slowing time, dust drifting orange and gold through a violet sky. It doesn't get much better than this.</p>

          <p>Excellent. Then you traveled Poeta far and wide, and revisited the sites that bore the first few steps of this new life of yours.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Treat this place as an anchor, [%username]. Poeta can steady your feet, ground you when you feel you are falling, and will always, always be a sanctuary for you to relax in.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>The guidebook hinted at specific locations within the region. You visited the place that serves the most delicious food in Poeta, the place that has the most beautiful sunset in Poeta, and the place where the cutest fungies in Poeta grow. At each place you got a stamp in your guidebook and a souvenir.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You returned to Makana and showed her your souvenirs. She suggested you take a break from time to time, and remember your roots.</p>
