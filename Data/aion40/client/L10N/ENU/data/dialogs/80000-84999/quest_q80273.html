          <p>Greetings, Daeva!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Yes, you! Still not used to being called that, are you?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It'll come in time, trust me. I'm a Mentor from Pandaemonium's Ascension Celebration Delegation. I've been sent specifically to provide additional aid to new Daevas.</p>

          <p>Sometimes you new Daevas need a little extra looking after. Not as much as a "seasoned" Elyos Guardian, obviously, but enough to get you on your feet and helping others.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The ACD has prepared a gift for you to congratulate you on your Ascension, if you're interested in it?</p>

          <p>Well!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Working alone takes guts, [%username], but that's not the Asmodian way. We help each other, find strength in numbers, and overcome our enemies as one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We are strong alone, but stronger together. You must learn that before anything else.</p>

          <p>We stand as one, and become mighty through cohesion. Your blood for mine, mine for yours, Elyos for Asmodian, and Asmodian for our ancestors and loved ones.</p>
