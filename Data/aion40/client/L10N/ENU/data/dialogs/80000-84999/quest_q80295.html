          <p>That's an unexpected question, but as it happens, I do. Those are some extremely rare weapons you're talking about though. Practically impossible to acquire, even.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not that finding five [%dic:STR_DIC_DC_relic_weapon_30]s is especially difficult, but you need to have all five Durable Daevanion armor pieces as well. And for that, well, you'd practically have to live five different lives to have any hope of getting that set.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, I suppose that if anyone can find a way to live five different lives, it would be you. Is this really something you want to attempt?</p>

          <p>I'm not sure if you're extremely confident, or just been spending too much time in the sun, but good luck to you.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't forget, you'll need all the parts of a Durable Daevanion armor set, and five [%dic:STR_DIC_DC_relic_weapon_30]s from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Olda] or [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Gerad] at Caps and Straps. Good luck to you.</p>

          <p>That's probably a wise decision on your part. Why spend all that time trying to get a single, incredibly rare, weapon when there are so many other weapons out there?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's practically impossible to get, after all. However, if you do change your mind, come back and talk to me again.</p>
