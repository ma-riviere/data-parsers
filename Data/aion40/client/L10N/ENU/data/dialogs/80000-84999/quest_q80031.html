          <p>Well, would you look at that! Have I arrived at the wrong city? Is Pandaemonium elsewhere?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Blink, and the city's full of so many new faces! Still, what's a lifetime to some is a mere heartbeat for others. You'd know that better than others, hey?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, there I go again. Always miss the introductions! I am Metrano, one of the Fayrefolk!</p>

          <p>Old as bones, or so they say. We're travelling merchants, the bane of the Black Cloud, if they're still around. We travel Atreia, collecting and making the finest wares in the known world!</p>

          <p>The Fayrefolk appear once in a lifetime, and those lucky enough to find us leave with unique and rare gifts!</p>

          <p>You are one of the lucky few, Daeva! Here, I have something for you. A gift. Give me your hand.</p>

          <p>Hmm... I feel something mysterious in that soul of yours. Someone is talking to me...they've passed into the Aetherstream.... Hmm. Do you know someone who has recently passed? Or if not, someone who knows someone who has recently passed?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, never worry. These things are inconsequential, and you are not here for inconsequentialities! Now, give me a moment while I unlock this gift of yours....</p>
