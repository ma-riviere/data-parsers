          <p>You don't know? Maybe I'm not the only one who's been spending too much time out in the sun.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, it doesn't matter anyway. It's not as though I have anything to feed you right now. I was sent to prepare this special Daeva's Day banquet, but I underestimated how much food I would need.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So now I need help, but I can't leave my post. It doesn't help me that the banquet is giving everyone a special buff. That just makes it more popular.</p>

          <p>I have the ingredients to make more food for the banquet, but not enough time to do it myself.</p>

          <p>Wonderful! Now listen carefully.</p>

          <p>All you have to do is stand by the [%dic:STR_DIC_N_World_dinner_of_Devas_Day_L] behind me, and use the exquisite ingredients I give you. Easy peasy!</p>
          <p> </p>
