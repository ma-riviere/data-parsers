          <p>Welcome to Daru Days! I'm dedicated to spreading awareness of these great and highly useful animals!</p>

          <p>They may be from Asmodae, but that doesn't mean we can't welcome them into the light, and into our hearts!</p>

          <p>I'll tell you later. First, let me educate you on the care and feeding of Darus. You can't just give them slop like Porguses.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They love to eat [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_HP_MP_40A]s and drink [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, you can get those right here in Elysea, from the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_01A]s that monsters carry!</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's fortunate for us that we can get Hay Crackers and Carrot Juice.</p>

          <p>Speaking of which, did you find them? My herd could really use a pick-me-up.</p>
