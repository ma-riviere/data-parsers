          <p>It's my son. He's been so kind to me lately, taking me in now that I can't take care of myself. He's so busy, and he thinks I don't pay attention, but I do.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I heard him saying he needs some new gloves, but I hardly think I know what the youngsters are wearing these days. I've been looking around, and you look like one of the best-dressed here, so I thought you'd know. What kind of gloves should I get for him?</p>

          <p>That's a lovely idea! They'll keep his hands warm, and he's always had such poor circulation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do you know, I think I heard that they are giving them away at the [%shoplink] as a special offer. You don't even need a coupon! I've tried using it before, though, and I couldn't wrap my mind around that newfangled thing. Would you get them for me? I'm sure it'll be easy enough for you.</p>
