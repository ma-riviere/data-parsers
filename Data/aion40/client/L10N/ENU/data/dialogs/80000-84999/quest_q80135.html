          <p>Depends! Do you think it's an amazingly powerful design for a black hole that would suck in the whole world if we're not careful--even the Abyss? Because if so, you're dead on.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you are right that we might be able to use it. I've heard about these strange Warped Rifts opening up all over Elysea, and I've been trying to come up with something that could close them. This might just do it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You could say it was very fortuitous that our paths crossed, Daeva.</p>

          <p>When you asked a Potion Master about the design, he said that it might help seal off the Warped Rifts for good.</p>
