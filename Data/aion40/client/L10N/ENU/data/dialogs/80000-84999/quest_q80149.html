          <p>What? Where did you get this design? This is powerful knowledge, and very dangerous in the wrong hands. A black hole can swallow anything, no matter how large.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But when they interact with a Rift, the whole thing implodes, sealing the danger forever. Perhaps that can help deal with these strange Rifts that have been claiming lives all over Asmodae?</p>

          <p>I don't have enough to thank you appropriately, but please take what I have.</p>
