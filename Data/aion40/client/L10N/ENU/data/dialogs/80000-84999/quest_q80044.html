          <p>Do you have siblings, [%username]? I used to go to the beach with my little brother when we were kids, and I'd bury him up to his neck in the sand... ahh, those were the days. I thought maybe we could relive those times, and I had the sailboats ready to go...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Only, our boats need repairing from last year, and monsters have made off with all the materials.</p>

          <p>Yes! I had the perfect [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80044A]s, and they were eaten all up by [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Agrint_34_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Rottentree_34_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_34_An]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ElementalEarth2_35_An]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I was going to ask you to retrieve them, but that's not really in the spirit of recapturing your youth, now is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Oh, wait! I've had a brainwave! How about we call it a dare? You must have done some pretty outrageous dares in your time, a bold Daeva like you...</p>

          <p>Like I said, the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80044A]s were eaten by the monsters from the Decayed Grove. Just don't ask me why I thought it would be a good idea to use that route. Shortest isn't always quickest, my old dad used to tell me. Well, I guess I am still a kid in some ways.</p>

          <p>You recovered the planks, but it seems unlikely that the boat will be ready in time.</p>
