          <p>Hail, [%userclass]! Are you enjoying the Millenium Festival?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We may be at war, but that doesn't mean we can't celebrate occasionally. In fact, events like this are especially important for us Daevas.</p>

          <p>Well, being immortal makes it easy for one to lose perspective and forget one's roots. The Millenium Festival helps prevent that.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>By making us contemplate how far we've come, it makes us remember where we've been, and who we were and are and will become.</p>
          <p> </p>
 	        <p>Still, the Festival is supposed to be fun, too. Would you like to hear about how to get special prizes?</p>

          <p>We of the Millennium Festival have scattered special items around the world for you to collect from monsters.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>The item I take is [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_07]--as in the vegetable, don't you know.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>All you need is to bring me a sufficient amount, and I can give you a prize. Perhaps you may even have enough right now?</p>

          <p>I'll admit that some Daevas have expressed distaste that the Festival continues while there's a war going on.</p>
          <p> </p>
      	  <p>But that's why we seeded the items this way--so that you could continue to battle for Elysea while participating in the Festival at the same time.</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>Still, if you have more pressing matters to attend to, I suppose that can't be helped.</p>

          <p>We deliberately made the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_07] unpalatable so monsters would hold onto it rather than eat it.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>Though I suppose that brings up the question of why they don't just throw it away. I think maybe the organizers do something to it?</p>
      	  <p> </p>
          <p>Still, they are good for one thing: prizes. That is, if you have enough of it....</p>

          <p> </p>
      	  <p>We want to give everyone who celebrates the Millenium Festival a chance at the prizes we offer. Besides, it's no fun if it's too easy.</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>If you have other tasks to complete, perhaps you'll get enough while doing them. But do be conscious of the time; the Festival is not forever.</p>

          <p>Please select whatever you like. You'll have a hard time getting these items once the Millenium Festival finishes!</p>
