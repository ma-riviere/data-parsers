          <p>What? Oh, I'm a country witch, but I guess I'm not a very good one, 'cuz now there's a bunch of spooky ghosts trying to kill me!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's scary! Could you help me? I wouldn't usually just ask a stranger for help, but I'm not sure what else to do! I'm so exhausted!</p>

          <p>It's Professional Souls--[%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_UndeadLightWiD_35_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_UndeadLightPrd_35_An]s to be exact. I've been running from them for days!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you could get rid of them, and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80088A]s. I...I think I could perform a divination on those and maybe figure out why they want to kill me.</p>
