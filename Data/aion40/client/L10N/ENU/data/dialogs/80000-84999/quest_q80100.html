          <p>Ah, Daeva, you've come to help.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They told me no one would ever help a lowly hedge witch here in the big city. But I knew I could count on my fellow Asmodians for aid.</p>

          <p>It's the visions. The terrible visions in my scrying bowl. When I gaze into the waters, I see glimpses of the future...of light, and torment, and terror.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It makes me shudder just to think about it. But I must see more! We must protect ourselves from this pending horror!</p>

          <p>I thank you for your aid. You are indeed of worthy blood.</p>

          <p>My needs are simple: I need energy to boost the strength of my scrying. Go forth and hunt [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_UndeadDarkWiD_35_An]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_UndeadDarkPrd_35_An]s, and bring me their [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80100A]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I am certain that I can channel the energy of those souls and clarify these visions.</p>
