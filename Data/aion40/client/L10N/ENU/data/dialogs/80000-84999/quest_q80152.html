          <p>Oh, Daeva. What a strange cloud swirls around your destiny. Your fate is like two images imprinted on my mind; one favorable, one... not so much.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I can help push things toward the happier fate, if you wish.</p>

          <p>What a shame. I really wished to see you succeed. Still, I cannot force you to believe, or to go along with my recommendations.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It is such a small thing, after all. A thing that won't even take you from your current path.</p>
          <p> </p>

          <p>That's a great relief to me, Daeva. I didn't want to alarm you before, but the fates of more than just one Daeva are hanging on this. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now for the task. During the final part of training in stage two of the Crucible Challenge, you'll receive a special Crucible Mark. Bring it to me, and I can use it in my ritual.</p>

          <p>Really? That is a mistake. If it were merely your own destiny hanging on this decision, I wouldn't push, but unfortunately you hold the fates of many in your hands.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Hurry up and change your mind. I'll still be here... possibly.</p>

          <p>It's a Crucible Mark all right, but I can hardly read it, it's so faded. I was hoping for something a little more valua--ah, um, useful.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Still, this is better than nothing! Now, run along.</p>

          <p>He seemed disappointed with the faded one you brought him, but said it would work. What it would work *for* remains a mystery.</p>
