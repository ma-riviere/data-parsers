          <p>Well, maybe you can. They say you help a lot of ordinary people, so I bet you can muster up some empathy even for someone as pathetic as me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The thing is, I might be a Daeva, but I only ascended a few months ago, and my parents are still making me go to school. Everyone picks on me. Dad says it's just because they're all jealous. Like that's any help!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They pick on me because I read books, because I know big words, and most of all because apparently I 'dress weird'.</p>

          <p>Well... everyone's wearing these headbands right now, with flowers on them. All kinds of flowers, really. Most have aria blooms, but I wanted something a bit more special.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first pilits have started blooming, so I want to get a Pilit Headband before anyone else has one! That will totally shut them up. I hear there's a place where you can even get them for free.</p>
