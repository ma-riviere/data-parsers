          <p>Well, you work with the tools you have at hand. I told him I'd reward him if he kept his word, but he disappeared! Did you ever hear of a Shugo running out before they get paid?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I mean, it wouldn't be such a big deal, but I kinda promised. And I'm stuck here organizing things.</p>
