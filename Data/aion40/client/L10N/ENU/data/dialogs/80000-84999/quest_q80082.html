          <p>Fun Daru fact: a Daru will always defeat a Daru's weight in Elrocos! It's true!</p>

          <p>Yes! But feeding them is tougher than you might think. They have specific needs.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They love to eat [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_HP_MP_40A]s and drink [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_FOOD_DPHEAL_30A]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can get those from the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_WRAP_EVENT_MIDAUTUMNDAY_01A]s that monsters carry! Getting some would be a good Daru education for you!</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's fortunate for us that we can get Hay Crackers and Carrot Juice.</p>
