          <p>Well, you can't blame me for catering to the majority of my audience, can you? Most of them want this to seem difficult, out of the ordinary. For me, it's just what I do.</p>

          <p>I offer them the same deal I'm about to offer you, though: give me just one small trinket that symbolizes your prowess in battle, and I can influence your fortune for the better.</p>
