          <p>Hello, Daeva! You are here for the Beer Festival, yes? So happy to see you here! Or, would be, if Beer Festival wasn't a washout this year...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Last night, all beer was ready for festival, but this morning, arrived to find no beer at all!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Must have been those witches.</p>

          <p>Worst is Blair, and her sidekick Witchta. Tried very best to ruin Harvest Revel last year. We thought we'd seen the last of them, that we'd be safe trying out brand new Beer Festival. Underestimated jealous witches, nyerk!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Most important thing is barley. Cannot make beer without barley.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If Daeva can bring me 20 grains of Fresh Barley, I will reward with this exquisitely crafted beer, said to restore much of your Energy of Repose.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Daeva. Excellent decision.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Have convinced some of Atreia's finest brewmasters to make beer for festival by telling them it is a competition. Brewing is very competitive field--did Daeva know? Anyway, once festival is going, you will be able to sample beers from the invited brewers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>One tip for Daeva, most likely you will find Fresh Barley while hunting. Good luck, akakakak!</p>

          <p>I just hope I have enough barley for all three, nyerk!</p>

          <p>Now just needs a quick drying out before giving to brewers.</p>
