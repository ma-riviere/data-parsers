          <p>Mother is traveling from the countryside to Sanctum to see me and one of her friends.</p>

          <p>The last I heard, she was in the forest in [%dic:STR_DIC_MLA129], but she should be out by now.</p>

          <p>I suppose she might be having trouble with the Worgs. Would you please go check for me?</p>

          <p>Oh thank you. The way her temper is sometimes, I'd think the Worgs would be more afraid of her than anything else.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Although she's been unusually pleasant recently. I wonder if she's met someone.</p>
