          <p>I was already tight on the deadline before those Star Debris interfered. That's why I need an extra pair of wings to keep my schedules.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That letter I gave you contains information for my associate, Conner.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But even more important is some information he needs to get to me. And we don't have the time or safety protocols in place to meet directly.</p>

          <p>Absolutely not! It's too dangerous, even for a Daeva of your caliber. You don't know what our enemies will stoop to....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You'll go through one of my organization's contacts. He's set up as a Verteron Trade Broker. Give him the countersign, and he'll help.</p>

          <p>I wish I could explain to you why this is so important. But I can't. Lord Nezekan forbids it.</p>
