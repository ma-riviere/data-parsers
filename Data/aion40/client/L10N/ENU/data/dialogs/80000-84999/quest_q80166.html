          <p>You seem like a hale and hearty Daeva! Truly the epitome of what Lord Azphel hopes for Asmodae!</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, another Daeva is taking on the Millenium Festival challenge! Your applause for this [%userclass]!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Your challenge is to gather [%dic:STR_DIC_I_WORLD_EVENT_COIN_AU_04]s. They have been seeded in monsters across Atreia exclusively for the Millenium Festival!</p>
	        <p> </p>
          <p>In fact, a marvelous specimen like you might have them in sufficient numbers already! Dare you see if you do?</p>

          <p>Yes, such is the reputation of the Millenium Festival challenge that even seasoned Daevas shy away at its mere mention!</p>
          <p> </p>
	        <p>However, no one should condemn this [%userclass] for caution. It is a necessary component of Asmodian valor.</p>

          <p>It is also a fine example of Asmodian know-how and ingenuity, the same creativity we use to battle the Balaur and Elyos!</p>
