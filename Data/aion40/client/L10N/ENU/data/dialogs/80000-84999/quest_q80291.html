          <p>Heard about those, did you? Only the most dedicated of Daevas will ever obtain one, but let me assure you, they're worth all the effort.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>The first step is collecting all the pieces for a set of Durable Daevanion armor. Then, I need to send five [%dic:STR_DIC_LC_relic_weapon_30]s to my collector friend. You can just purchase those.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, to get a full set of Durable Daevanion armor, you'd practically have to relive your life several times over. Still, if you're willing to go through all that, I will gladly reward you with the Durable Daevanion weapon of your choice.</p>
