          <p>Welcome to Daru Days! I'm here to remind all Asmodians just how big a role Darus play in our daily lives!</p>

          <p>Fun Daru fact: a Daru can live on its own droppings for a year! It's true!</p>

          <p>You may have been sarcastic, but it really is fun! For example, feeding them is a challenge. They have specific needs.</p>

          <p>Darus are very particular animals. But that just makes their fur all the softer and their meat all the more tender.</p>
