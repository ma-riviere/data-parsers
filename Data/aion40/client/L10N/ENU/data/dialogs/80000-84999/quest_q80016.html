          <p>Ah, that's a shame. [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80016a]s are a big part of the Solorius tradition! Who doesn't remember tipping all their presents out of the socks and running around the house while wearing it as a hat? Or...um...that might just have been me.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, the point is, Solorius is going to be ruined if some kind Daeva doesn't decide to help us out!</p>

          <p>Those [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_XmasEvent_ShugoSantaD_99_n]s were supposed to put gifts into the socks. I don't know what they're playing at. Did they fall asleep on the job? Are they running around Poeta wearing the socks on their heads? Did they discover an alarming sock shortage in the villages of Eltnen and rush off on a shugoitarian mission?</p>

          <p>You have to track down the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Branch_Event_XmasEvent_ShugoSantaD_99_n]s to find them. They're supposed to be helping with the Solorius preparations, but they're slacking off instead.</p>
