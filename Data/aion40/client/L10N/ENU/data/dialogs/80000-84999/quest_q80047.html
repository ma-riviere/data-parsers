          <p>When I was a kid, my parents would always tell me that those were the best days of my life. It seemed stupid, then. No wings, no control over my own life, and worst of all those sailor suits they used to put me in.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that I'm a little older, I can see what they meant. I even sort of miss the sailor costumes...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>This summer, I had a plan. I was going to take advantage of the nice... well, nicER... weather, while I had the chance.</p>

          <p>Yes. See, I have this sailboat. A bit of a fixer-upper, but that was the best I could get. I was even excited about repairing it. Until the materials went missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I had some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80047A]s being shipped across the Salintus Desert yesterday, and now they've gone missing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So... in the spirit of another great childhood tradition, I dare you to go to the Salintus Desert and get them back!</p>

          <p>Oh, that's a relief. It was the [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardD_25_An]s, [%dic:STR_DIC_M_merdionD_25_n]s, and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_ShellizardD_27_An]s that ate the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_80047A]s.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So when you're in Salintus Desert, you may need to kill these creatures and root around through their insides to find the boards.</p>
