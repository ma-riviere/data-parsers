          <p>Why do Humans value writing so? Numbers Muorinerk understands. Profit in numbers, akakak. But Humans write, write, write. Has Daeva heard of Lepharist Written Oaths? Muorinerk has seen many Daevas looking for those, yes.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Lepharists always writing too. Of course, sometimes they lose these writings....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All that pretty boring to Muorinerk. But profit is never boring, no, no, no. Are you interested in Lepharist Written Oaths, Daeva? </p>

          <p>Well, Muorinerk might know where you can get some. Very careless, these Lepharists. Always losing things. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course oaths aren't worth anything to Shugos, so Muorinerk might be willing to part with them in return for something more...useful, akakak. </p>

          <p>Ah, good, good, good. Now, what Muorinerk needs is more [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_4303a]s. Worth more Kinah. You bring masks, Muorinerk gives you oaths. All nice and even. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Daeva should go to Lepharist Citadel--lots of masks there. Remember, [%dic:STR_DIC_E_NormalR] have masks Muorinerk needs.</p>

          <p>Oh, maybe you don't need the oaths, then. That's okay. Plenty of others ready to trade with Muorinerk, nyerk. If you change your mind, though, Muorinerk will be here. </p>

          <p>Before you ask, Lepharist Written Oaths are not stolen! Never stolen. No, we trade for them. We find them, sometimes, but never STEAL them. Nyerk! Such an awful thought.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Really, we all work together in this. You defeat Lepharists to take their masks, we give you written oaths...all one great circle of life. We work together as close, helpful, profitable allies. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Muorinerk feels very touched by all this. All warm and fuzzy. Let's see the masks. </p>

          <p>What? Perhaps Muorinerk is mistaken, but no! No masks. Muorinerk feels very disappointed, nyerk. This is not so hard, yes? No?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Go on now. If Daeva wants written oaths, kill [%dic:STR_DIC_E_NormalR], bring me [%dic:STR_DIC_I_quest_4303a]s. Hop to it! </p>

          <p>Ah, brave Daeva! Such a good, good, good job. Exactly right. Although...they look a bit shabby. But no matter, no matter. Well done. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Here are real Lepharist Written Oaths, written by real Lepharists. Muorinerk got them himself. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Muorinerk could use more masks still. If Daeva needs more oaths, bring more masks. Muorinerk always enjoys doing business with brave, clever Daeva. </p>
