          <p>Each year, each month, each day it gets more and more cumbersome for me to move. Just to walk about my cabin is such an exertion. Soon I will cease to have the energy needed to even arise in the morning, and then death will come for me, like a dark specter, reaching to claim my very...um...what was I saying?</p>

          <p>Good question! Every year around this time, I collect Twisp from the Patamor Thicket. Then I spin thread out of it to make clothes. Making those clothes gives me the feeling of starting a new year. I look so forward to it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But this year...I'm so old now, if I go out to gather in this condition, I could get killed by Spriggs!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you don't mind, Daeva, would you collect some for me? Of course, I will pay you for the labor.</p>
