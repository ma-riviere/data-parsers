          <p>The Fortress has been putting off dealing with the Lepharist Citadel. Between the Mau and Elyos traveling here through the rifts we had enough to deal with, and the threat seemed small.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They decided we couldn't afford an all-out war with the Lepharists, but I think that was the wrong decision. They're expanding their territory daily, and we sit by and do nothing.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p> The village representatives and the Brigade General have agreed to a compromise, but I'm still concerned. What do you think? </p>

          <p>It's hard to say. Thus far we've mounted no concerted effort to stop them. That ends now. We can't mobilize the Archons of Morheim, but we can ask other Daevas for help. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We need help with the [%dic:STR_DIC_E_HardR] in the citadel, and their written oaths as evidence--for the village and for Morheim. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We've had special rings crafted in Pandaemonium as payment for assistance. Would you be interested? We sorely need your help.</p>

          <p>Thank you so much. Blood for blood, [%username]. You know, it's easy to overlook the Lepharist Revolutionaries. After all, they're Asmodian. They're our family and friends--they look, act, and speak like us while all the while working toward our downfall. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It bothers me more than I can say to have them so close but not know what damage they're doing. Your willingness to help eases my mind. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Don't forget to bring me the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_JUNK_D_LEHPAR_QUEST_01A]s. I'll need those.</p>
