          <p>They say Eltnen is a sinking ship. "Abandon it now while other regions can still be saved," they said. I refused then, and I refuse now.</p>

          <p>The rats may have left, [%username], but I am no rat. I am a Daeva. Eltnen can be saved. Eltnen WILL be saved.</p>

          <p>Yes. You cannot place a forest in a desert, but you can search for hardier seeds of hardier trees. As a castle is built on foundations, these new trees will be Eltnen's new fortress.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I have found the seeds we need. And with the power of the Mystic Springs, we can cut years off our time-frame. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I sent [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Iandeus] to study our options, but have not yet heard from him. Would you be willing to go and ask how he is doing?</p>
