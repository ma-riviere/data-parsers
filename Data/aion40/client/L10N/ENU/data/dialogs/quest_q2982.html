          <p>I'm interested in taking on a successor. I've been keeping an eye on a lot of Daevas and you're definitely one of the more promising tailors in Asmodae.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But before I consider you for my successor, you'll have to become an Expert. And that will mean you can only choose one other profession to become Expert in--once you're done with your studies.</p>

          <p>Okay. Let's start out by testing you with Zyakia's Noble Sash. Make one and show it to me, and I'll tell you if you're good enough.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You can buy the Zyakia's Noble Sash design from [%dic:STR_DIC_N_Kaiot]. It's a more complicated design than [%dic:STR_DIC_E_Q2982], but I'm sure you can craft a noble one.</p>
