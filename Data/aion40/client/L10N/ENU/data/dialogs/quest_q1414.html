          <p>Now that we understand what's going on, we need to stop it. Your first mission is to stop the Krall's Odium production.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>They're using it to amplify their strength, but if it's properly refined it can also be used to open an Abyss Gate. We must not let them refine it!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I've been planning a mission to infiltrate the Kaidan Headquarters and undermine their refining capabilities.</p>

          <p>We'll have to strike at the resources they need to enable their processing. As you approach the Kaidan Headquarters, you'll see a windmill. That windmill is used to generate the power to refine Odium.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>There's an [%dic:STR_DIC_LF2_Gear_Q1414] attached to the windmill. Without it, the mechanism won't function, and it will take quite some time to replace. If you take out the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1414a], the windmill will stop.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You're the one most familiar with that base. Will you take the mission?</p>
