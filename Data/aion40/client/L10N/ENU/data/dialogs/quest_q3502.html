          <p>As you know, [%username], our primary mission is to block the Abyss Gate. You destroyed it once but, of course, it's been rebuilt.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I think it's necessary to go a bit further this time.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Return to Dark Poeta via the Artifact of Transcendence over there. Can you guess what your mission is?</p>

          <p>Exactly! This time you'll completely block the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Dragonportal_IDLF1]. Permanently deactivate it.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>High Priest Jucleas personally chose you for this mission. Don't let him down.</p>

          <p>Now, we need to work out how to shut that thing down. You'll have to look for some kind of plans, something that would show us how to cripple the device.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>First find that, memorize its contents, then destroy the [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Dragonportal_IDLF1] completely. </p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>If you fail, all of Elysea will be in danger, [%username]. Block the gate...no matter the cost.</p>

          <p>Maloren said that you must completely block the Abyss Gate used by the Balaur in Dark Poeta but didn't know just how you'd manage.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You found the Balaur Operation Orders in Dark Poeta, and learned that destroying all power generators would permanently block the gate.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>However, just as you destroyed the generators, Brigade General Anuhart appeared and a titanic battle ensued.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You defeated Brigade General Anuhart and reported back to Sanctum. Jucleas praised and thanked you for saving Elysea from danger...again.</p>
