          <p>Have you had a chance to fly around the Fortress, [%username]? There are  [%dic:STR_DIC_I_AG_SOURCE_OD_10A]es floating up there!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Kyros believes they are generated when two streams of Aether cross. Fascinating stuff....</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, with an Abyss Gate beneath our feet, Aether streams cross fairly regularly, resulting in quite a few Small Vortexes. </p>

          <p>Oh no, in fact they're really quite useful! We extract Aether powder from them, which is indispensable these days.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Would you like to help gather some, [%username]? It'd be good flight training, and of course you'll be helping the war effort.</p>

          <p>Now be careful. Daevas often get carried away when they collect Aether, and forget about their flight stamina. The moment you feel tired you must land until your strength recovers.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>As I said, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_AG_SOURCE_OD_10A] float all around the [%dic:STR_DIC_W_LF2_SZ_OP]. Please extract ten pinches of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_od_n_c_10b], then return to me.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>There are many other tasks that need carrying out if we are to win this war. Gathering Aether powder is just one of those tasks, and can only be done by our Daevas.</p>

          <p>Aethertapping is very similar to extracting any of Atreia's nutrients, though I would imagine doing it in mid-air adds an extra challenge.</p>

          <p>Ten pinches! Perfect!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Such a small amount. A single drop of blackthorn poison can drop an adult Mamut in seconds--that's nothing compared to Aether powder.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Of course, Aether powder is no poison, and has many positive uses. I'll have this sent to Sanctum straight away--here is your reward.</p>
