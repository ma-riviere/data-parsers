          <p>Cooking...my one true passion...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You know what makes the biggest difference to a meal, [%username]? The ingredients or, rather, their condition. Take good care of your ingredients and they will reward you many times over in their taste, consistency, and texture. Store them badly or handle them brashly, and the flavor, texture, and appearance of your creations will suffer.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>So, before you delve deeply into cooking, I have a test for you. Do you know how to prepare ingredients properly?</p>

          <p>You think so? You're hardly instilling me with an overwhelming sense of confidence, [%userclass].</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>We'll start with a basic method of cooking: roasting. But first, you'll need to gather a type of shellfish, [%dic:STR_DIC_I_GB_SOURCE_SHELL_10A]s. This is a relatively simple task, but roasting Inina can still go wrong. Undercook them and you'll poison all who eat them. Overcook them and they'll become bland and lose their nutritional value.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Do well here and you'll have made a solid start to your cooking career.</p>

          <p>Good! Before long you'll be serving five-course meals and rocking the foundations of the culinary world here in Sanctum!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, first you'll need to collect the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_GB_SOURCE_SHELL_10A]s. The best place for them has always been in and around [%dic:STR_DIC_FLA09]. I'd suggest heading there and looking near the water.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Bring back as many Inina as possible. It's easy to ruin a few of them when starting out. When you've found enough, come back here and cook them using our facilities.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>No. Cooking is no hobby, and more the fool anyone who thinks otherwise.</p>

          <p>So how did you get on? Not as easy as it first seems, is it?</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Remember, cooking is no simple task. More complicated dishes can yield fantastic results for both body and soul, and can even help our Daevas in combat.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now, as the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. Let's see what you've cooked.</p>

          <p> </p>
          <p>This is no joke, [%username]. Cooking is an art form and, like all art it deserves to be treated with the utmost respect. This may seem like an overly simple task for a Daeva, but I will not teach you the finer points of cooking until you have mastered the basics.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Did you forget to collect the [%dic:STR_DIC_I_GB_SOURCE_SHELL_10A]s or forget to roast them? Dinner doesn't cook itself!</p>

          <p>Oh...oh my! I thought the color was perfect, but the taste...the taste is just sublime! The texture is just right, too: not too soft, but without any hint of them being overdone. Perfection, if I may be so bold...</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>You, [%username], are either extremely lucky, or have just ably demonstrated a gift that I have not seen in many, many years.</p>
