          <p>I dispatched a spy recently, but he hasn't made his report.</p>

          <p>I received word of Lepharist movements recently. I was reluctant to dispatch Dewi, but he was confident he'd accomplish the mission.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>It's been some time, however, and I admit to being nervous.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'd like to think nothing's wrong, or else he has nothing to report. I cannot, however, gamble on that.</p>
