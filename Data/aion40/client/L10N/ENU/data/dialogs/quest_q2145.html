          <p>New union rules dictate that I explain why we only accept certain manastones in bundles of 10 now. Sure, I can tell you that it's more economical to ship items in bulk...but you know that's just mouth-music.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Now that the Manastone Removers Association has been unionized, we really can't be fired for anything. And none of us like dealing with these old Daevas haggling over single manastones. So we reinvented the rules.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Ah, I love being in a union! Anyway, the bundles I need today are MP +30, Evasion +6, and Parry +14 manastones. You find me 10 of each of those, and I'll hook you up with some nice new manastones.</p>

          <p>And let's just make this very clear right now, shall we? I need MP +30, Evasion +6, and Parry +14 manastones.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Not 3 of them, and not 7 of them...but 10 of them. 10 of each or no deal. If you have them on you, great. If not, start looking....</p>

          <p>Yeah, the Manastone Removers Association offered me the Union Manager position a few weeks back, but I turned it down.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>I'm more of a people-person. I like being outdoors. And management positions kind of frown on having afternoon ales...so it was a no-brainer, really.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Anyway, did you find my manastones for me?</p>

          <p>Very nice work, Daeva.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>And as promised, here's some newer manastones for you. I got a few of these beauties after they...wink, wink...fell out of a crate coming back from Beluslan.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But you didn't hear me say that. And besides, crates are always breaking there in those rough environments. Unionized crate makers, too.</p>

          <p>Lakutu said he would exchange 3 bundles of particular manastones for a reward of higher grade manastones, on behalf of the Manastone Removers Association.</p>
