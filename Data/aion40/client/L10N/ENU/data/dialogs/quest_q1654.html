          <p>You've already heard about the Balaur Legion holed up deep inside the Kishar village.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Even though they won't--and probably can't--leave their barracks, they're still a problem. We're fighting the Kishar Krall, but with the Balaur at their backs, they can retreat without fear.</p>

          <p>Not enough! I've asked New Heiron Gate, Eltnen Fortress, and even Sanctum for reinforcements.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Nothing. Just more orders to keep the pressure up. I see the writing on the wall--it's only a matter of time before we're on the defensive.</p>

          <p>[%username], you don't want the Balaur to destroy Heiron, do you? Please help us!</p>

          <p>Thank you! I'd like you to get rid of [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3E3_FeB_LizardFi_43_Ae_Tune]s and [%dic:STR_DIC_M_LF3E3_FeC_LizardFi_44_Ae_Tune]s in the Indratu Barracks.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those are the main forces of the Indratu Legion. Without them as a strategic reserve, we'll defeat the Krall. It'll also get us closer to the Nute Warrens where the Balaur leadership is.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>May Ariel light your path, [%username]. We're all counting on you.</p>
