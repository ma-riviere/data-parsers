          <p>That task Lyfjaberga asked you to do was actually a test of sorts. We're looking for individuals who can carry out the teachings of Destiny.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>What went though your mind as you stood in front of a fallen comrade? Resurrecting him or leaving him dead, it was your choice.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>Those who have been given the teachings of Destiny are always under such pressure.</p>

          <p>I suppose it is. Many fall during these turbulent times,and there aren't enough disciples of Destiny to save everybody. So here we are, seeking your help.</p>

          <p>It's a shame you're not a disciple of the Temple of Destiny. You would have made a fine Chanter or Cleric!</p>

          <p>But please keep a [%dic:STR_DIC_I_SOULSTONE_RESURRECT] in your cube at all times, so you can raise a fellow Asmodian anywhere, any time.</p>
