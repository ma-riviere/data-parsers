          <p>I have a dozen tasks to complete, all of which are annoying. The Tigrics, however, have really earned my ire.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>That's why I'm sending you to their village. The herd needs culling.</p>

          <p>Search for Tigric Looters wandering about and bring me some [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1602a].</p>
          <p> </p>
        <p>It's high-quality and fetches a fine price in Sanctum. This way, we kill two birds with one stone.</p>

          <p>Just head to Tigric Village, catch [%dic:STR_DIC_M_Tauric_39_An]s and bring 15 pieces of [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1602a] to me.</p>

          <p>Try not to mar the leather. Scraps are worthless.</p>

          <p>I contacted Sanctum and told Benes about our little plan. He's very excited.</p>

          <p>Benes is always trying to be a trendsetter, so it's not hard to sell him on the idea of Tigric leather.</p>

          <p>Now, did you actually get any [%dic:STR_DIC_I_QUEST_1602a]?</p>

          <p>Please bring me 15 pieces of Tigric Leather before he changes his mind. Hurry up!</p>
