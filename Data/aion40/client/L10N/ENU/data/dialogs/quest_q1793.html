          <p>You know, it pained me that our dainty Centurion Minerva had to endure our hardships here, so I asked if she needed help. She smiled...and gave me a huge pile of work. Hahaha!</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>All right, business... A Dredgion crashed not very far from here. We have no idea why, but we intend to use this chance to the fullest.</p>

          <p>Okay, Dredgions can obliterate anything in the Abyss, which causes us huge headaches, right?</p>

          <p>We've had to disengage from battle against the Asmodians many times even when we were winning because of a Dredgion suddenly attacking from nowhere.</p>

          <p>Well, the researchers in Sanctum say if they had a [%dic:STR_DIC_OBJ_Ab1_Module_Q1793] or two to study, there's probably a weakness we could use. Little problem? We've never so much as scratched one.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <p>But a crashed Dredgion? That's the jackpot! </p>

          <p>How about it, [%username], aren't you interested? This thing might give us the blade we need to gut the Balaur.</p>
